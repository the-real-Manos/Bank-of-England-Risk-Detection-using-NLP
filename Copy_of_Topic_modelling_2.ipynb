Welcome to JPMorgan Chase’s First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded . \\nYour line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by.  \\n \\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie D imon, and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy \\nBarnum.  \\n \\nMr. Barnum, please go ahead.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  \\nThanks, and good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer on the b ack. \\n \\nStarting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $12.6 billion, EPS o f $4.10 on revenue of $39.3 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 23%. \\nThese results included $868 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate.  \\n \\nBefore reviewing our results for the quarter, let's talk about the recent bank failures. Jamie has add ressed a number of the important themes in \\nhis shareholder letter and a recent televised interview so I will go straight to the specific impacts on the firm.  \\n \\nAs you would expect, we saw significant new account opening activity and meaningful deposit and m oney market fund inflows, most \\nsignificantly in the Commercial Bank, Business Banking and AWM. Regarding the deposit inflows, at the Firmwide level, average  deposits \\nwere down 3% quarter -on-quarter while end -of-period deposits were up 2% quarter -on-quarter  – implying an intra -quarter reversal of the \\nrecent outflow trend as a consequence of the March events. We estimate that we have retained approximately $50 billion of the se deposit \\ninflows at quarter -end. \\n \\nIt's important to note that while the sequential p eriod -end deposit increase is higher than we would have otherwise expected, our current full \\nyear NII outlook – which I will address at the end – still assumes modest deposit outflows from here. We expect these outflows to be driven by \\nthe same factors as last quarter, as well as the expectation that we will not retain all of this quarter's inflows.  \\n \\nNow back to the quarter, touching on a few highlights. We grew our IB fee wallet share, consumer spending remains solid with combined debit \\nand credit card spe nd up 10% year -on-year, and credit continues to normalize, but actual performance remains strong across the company.  \\n \\nOn page 2, we have some more detail. Revenue of $39.3 billion was up $7.7 billion or 25% year -on-year. NII ex. Markets was up $9.2 billion  \\nor 78%, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. NIR ex. Markets was down $1.1 billion or 10%, dri ven by the \\nsecurities losses previously mentioned as well as lower IB fees and lower auto lease income on lower volume, and Market s revenue was \\ndown $371 million or 4% year -on-year.   \\n \\nExpenses of $20.1 billion were up $916 million or 5% year -on-year, driven by compensation -related costs reflecting the annualization of last \\nyear's headcount growth and wage inflation. These results inc lude the impact of the higher FDIC assessment I mentioned last quarter which, \\nof course, is unrelated to recent events. And credit costs of $2.3 billion included net charge -offs of $1.1 billion, predominantly in Card. The net \\nreserve build of $1.1 billion was largely driven by deterioration in our weighted -average economic outlook.  \\n \\nOn to balance sheet and capital on page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.8%, up about 60 basis points, which w as primarily \\ndriven by the benefit of net income les s distributions and AOCI gains. And in line with what we previously said, we resumed stock buybacks \\nthis quarter and distributed a total of $1.9 billion in net repurchases back to shareholders.  \\n \\nNow, let's go to our businesses starting with CCB on page 4. Touching quickly on the health of U.S. consumers and small businesses based \\non our data. Both continue to show resilience and remain on the path to normalization, as expected, but we continue to monito r their activity \\nclosely. Spend remains solid and we ha ve not observed any notable pullback throughout the quarter.  \\n \\nMoving to financial results, CCB reported net income of $5.2 billion, on revenue of $16.5 billion, which was up 35% year -on-year. In Banking \\nand Wealth Management, revenue was up 67% year -on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. Average deposits were down 2% quarter -\\non-quarter, in line with recent trends. Throughout the quarter, we continued to see customer flows to higher yielding products a s you would \\nexpect, but we're encouraged by what we are capturing in CDs and our wealth management offerings. Client investment assets were down \\n1% year -on-year, but up 7% quarter -on-quarter, driven by market performance as well as strong net inflows. In Home Lending, revenue was \\ndown 38% year -on-year, l argely driven by lower net interest income from tighter loan spreads and lower production revenue.  \\n \\n3 \\n \\nMoving to Card Services and Auto – revenue was up 14% year -on-year, largely driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving \\nbalances, partially offset  by lower Auto lease income. Credit card spend was up 13% year -on-year. Card outstandings were up 21%, driven by \\nstrong new account growth and revolve normalization. And in Auto, originations were $9.2 billion, up 10% year -on-year. Expenses of $8.1 \\nbillion  were up 5% year -on-year reflecting the impact of wage inflation and higher headcount. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit \\ncosts were $1.4 billion, reflecting reserve builds of $300 million in Card and $50 million in Home Lending. Net charg e-offs were $1.1 billion, up \\nabout $500 million year -on-year, in line with expectations as delinquency levels continue to normalize across portfolios.  \\n \\nNext, the CIB on page 5. CIB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $13.6 billion. Investment  Banking revenue of $1.6 billion was \\ndown 24% year -on-year. IB fees were down 19%. We ranked number one with first quarter wallet share of 8.7%. In advisory, fees were down \\n6% compared to a strong first quarter last year. Our underwriting businesses contin ued to be affected by market conditions with fees down \\n34% for debt and 6% for equity.  \\n \\nIn terms of the outlook, the dynamics remain the same: our pipeline is relatively robust, but conversion is sensitive to mark et conditions and \\nthe economic outlook. We expect the second quarter and the rest of the year to remain challenging.  \\n \\nMoving to Markets, total revenue was $8.4 billion, down 4% year -on-year. Fixed Income was flat. Rates was strong during the rally early in the \\nquarter, as well as throug h the elevated volatility in March. Credit was up on the back of higher client flows and Currencies & Emerging \\nMarkets was down relative to a very strong first quarter in  the prior year. Equity Markets was down 12%, driven by lower revenues in \\nderivatives relative to a strong first quarter in the prior year and lower client activity in Cash.  \\n \\nPayments revenue was $2.4 billion, up 26% year -on-year. Excluding the net impact of equity investments, primarily a gain in the prior year, it \\nwas up 55%, with the gro wth driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. Securities Services revenue of $1.1 billion was \\nup 7% year -on-year, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances and market levels. Expenses of $7.5 billion were up 2% \\nyear-on-year as higher headcount and wage inflation were largely offset by lower revenue -related compensation.  \\n \\nMoving to the Commercial Bank on page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.3 billion. Revenue of $3.5 billion was up 46% \\nyear-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins. Payments revenue of $2 billion was up 98% year -on-year driven by higher rates, and gross \\nInvestment Banking revenue of $881 million was up 21% year -on-year on increased M&A and bond underwriting from large deal act ivity. \\n \\nExpenses of $1.3 billion were up 16% year -on-year, largely driven by higher compensation expense, including front office hiring and \\ntechnology investments, as well as higher volume -related expense. Average deposits were down 16% year -on-year and 5%  quarter -on-\\nquarter, predominantly driven by continued attrition in non -operating deposits as well as seasonally lower balances.  \\n \\nLoans were up 13% year -on-year and 1% sequentially. C&I loans were up 1% quarter -on-quarter, with somewhat different dynamics based on \\nclient size. In Middle Market Banking, higher rates and recession concerns have decreased new loan demand and utilization, wh ich is also \\nleading to weakness in capex spending.  \\n \\nIn Corporate Client Banking, utilization rates increased modestly quar ter-on-quarter as capital market conditions led more clients to opt for \\nbank debt. CRE loans were also up 1% sequentially, with higher rates creating headwinds from both originations and prepayment s. And given \\nthe recent focus on commercial real estate, le t me remind you that our office sector exposure is less than 10% of our portfolio and is focused \\nin urban dense markets; and nearly two -thirds of our loans are multifamily, primarily in supply constrained markets. Finally, credit costs of \\n$417 million incl uded a net reserve build of $379 million predominantly driven by what I mentioned upfront.  \\n \\nThen to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.4 billion with pre -tax margin \\nof 35%. Revenue of $4.8 bil lion was up 11% year -on-year, driven by higher deposit margins on lower balances and a valuation gain on our \\ninitial investment triggered by taking full ownership of our Asset Management Joint Venture in China, partially offset by the  impact of lower \\navera ge market levels on management fees and lower performance fees. Expenses of $3.1 billion were up 8% year -on-year, predominantly \\ndriven by compensation, reflecting growth in our private banking advisor teams, higher revenue -related compensation and the run -rate impact \\nof acquisitions.  \\n \\nFor the quarter, net long -term inflows were $47 billion, led by Fixed Income and Equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $93 billion, \\ninclusive of our ongoing deposit migration. AUM of $3 trillion was up 2% year -on-year and overall client assets of $4.3 trillion were up 6% \\ndriven by continued net inflows into liquidity and long -term products. And finally, loans were down 1% quarter -on-quarter, driven by lower \\nsecurities -based lending, while average deposits were down 5%. \\n \\nTurning to Corporate on page 8. Corporate reported net income of $244 million. Revenue was $985 million compared to a net los s of $881 \\nmillion last year. NII was $1.7 billion, up $2.3 billion year -on-year, due to the impact of higher rates. NIR was a loss of $755 million compared \\nwith a loss of $345 million in the prior year, and  included the net investment securities losses I mentioned earlier. Expenses of $160 million \\nwere down $24 million year -on-year. And credit costs of $370 million were driven by  reserve builds on a couple of single name exposures.  \\n \\n \\n4 \\n \\nNext, the Outlook on page 9. We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex. Markets to be approximately $81 billion. This increase in gui dance is \\nprimarily driven by lower rate paid assumptions across both consume r and wholesale in light of the expectation of Fed cuts later in the year, as \\nwell as slightly higher card revolving balances. Note that in line with my comments at the outset, recent deposit balance inc reases are not a \\nmeaningful contributor to the upward  revision in the NII outlook given that we expect a meaningful portion of the recent inflows to reverse later \\nin the year.  \\n \\nI would point out that this outlook still embeds significant reprice lags: we think a more sustainable NII ex. Markets run -rate in t he medium -term \\nis well below this quarter's $84 billion, as well as below the $80 billion that is implied for the rest of the year by our fu ll year guidance; and \\nwhile we don't know exactly when this lower run -rate will be reached, when it happens, we beli eve it will be around the mid -70s. \\n \\nAnd, of course, as we mentioned last quarter, this NII outlook remains highly sensitive to the uncertainty associated with th e timing and the \\nextent of deposit reprice, investment portfolio decisions, the dynamics of QT and RRP, the trajectory of Fed funds, as well as the broader \\nmacroeconomic environment – including its impact on loan growth. Separately, it's worth noting that Markets NII may start to trend slightly \\npositive towards the end of the year as a function of m ix and rate effects.  \\n \\nMoving to expenses, our outlook for 2023 continues to be about $81 billion. Importantly, this does not currently include the impact of the \\npending FDIC special assessment. And on credit, we continue to expect the 2023 Card net charge -off rate to be approximately 2.6%.  \\n \\nSo to wrap up, our strong results this quarter once again highlight the earnings power of this diversified franchise. We have  benefited from our \\nfortress principles and commitment to invest, which we will continue to do as we head into an increasingly uncertain environment.  \\n \\nWith that – operator please open the line for Q&A.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\n \\nQUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION  \\n  \\nOperator : Please stand by. The first question is coming from the line of Steve Chubak with Wolfe Research, now open.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nSteven Chubak  \\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research LLC  Q \\nHey, good morning.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nGood morning, Steve.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nSteven Chubak  \\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research LLC  Q \\nSo, Jamie, I was actually hoping to get your perspective on how you see the recent developments with SVB impacting the regulatory \\nlandscape for the big banks. In your letter you spent a fair amount of time highlighting the consequences of overly stringent  capital \\nrequirements, the risk of steering more activities to the less regulated nonbanks. But what are some of the changes that you're scenario \\nplanning for – whether it's higher capital, increase in FDIC assessment fees? And along those same lines, how you're thinking about the \\nbuyback given continued strong capital build, but a lot of macro uncertainty at the moment.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nWell, I think you were already kind of complete with answering your own question there. Loo k, we're hoping that everyone just takes a deep \\nbreath and looks at what happened and the breadth and depth of regulations already in place. Obviously, when something happen s like this, \\nyou should adjust, think about it. So I think down the road there may be some limitations on held -to-maturity, maybe more TLAC for certain \\ntype-size banks, and more scrutiny on interest rate exposure, and stuff like that. But it doesn't have to be a revamp of the whole  system, just \\nrecalibrating things the right way.  \\n \\nAnd I think it should be done knowing what you want the outcome to be. The outcome you should want is very strong community and reg ional \\nbanks. And certain actions are taken which are drastic – it could actually make them weaker. So, that's all it is. We do expe ct higher capital \\nfrom Basel IV, effectively and, obviously there's going to be an FDIC assessment – that'll be what it is.  \\n \\n5 \\n \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nSteven Chubak  \\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research LLC  Q \\nGot it. And just in terms of appetite for the buyback, just given some of the...  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nOh, yeah.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nSteven Chubak  \\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research LLC  Q \\n...elevated macro uncertainties.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nWell, we've told you that we're kind of penciling in $12 billion for this year. Obviously, capital is more than that, but – and we did a little bit of \\nbuyback this quarter. We're going to wait and see. We don't mind keeping our powder dry, and you've seen us do that with investment \\nportfolios, and we're also going to do that with capital.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nSteven Chubak  \\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research LLC  Q \\nThat's great. I'll hop back into the queue. Thanks so much for taking my questions.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nOkay.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\n \\nOperator:  Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. You may proceed.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nKen Usdin  \\nAnalyst, Jefferies LLC  Q \\nHey, thanks. Good morning. Hey, Jeremy, I was just wondering if you can just give us a little bit more detail on those lower funding expectation \\npoints that you made, just in terms of is it because of what you can offer the client that might allow you to kind of keep th at beta lower? And \\nmaybe you can just  kind of wrap it into what your overall beta expectations are in that revised update? Thank you.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah, sure. So let me just summarize the drivers of the change in the outlook. So the primary driver really is lower deposit rate paid \\nexpectations across both consumer and wholesale, which, as you mentioned, is driven by a couple factors. So, the change in th e rate \\nenvironment, with cuts coming sooner in the outlook, all else equal, does t ake some pressure off the reprice. And as you said, we're getting a \\nlot of positive feedback from the field on our product offerings. The short -term CD, in particular, is really getting a lot of positive feedback from \\nour folks in the branches. It's been v ery attractive to yield -seeking customers. So that's kind of working well. And then on the asset side, we \\nare seeing a little bit higher Card revolve, which is helping.  \\n \\nAnd I'll just remind you that at a conference in February, I suggested that we were al ready starting to feel like some of the uncertainties we \\nmentioned when giving the guidance had started all moving in the same direction, and that was one of the things that contribu ted to the \\nupward revision, like all of the uncertainty kind of went the s ame way. But as Jamie's pointed out – those uncertainties are all still there, we \\nhighlight them on the page, and as we look forward to this year and to next year and the medium -term we remain very focused on those.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\n \\n6 \\n \\nKen Usdin  \\nAnalyst, Jefferies LLC  Q \\nYeah, and as a follow -up on the point about rate expectations coming now in, and potentially getting cut sooner – how do you take a look at \\nwhat that might mean just for the broader economy? Do you think it's more just because inflation's coming down? Do y ou think it's because \\nthe Fed's just got to react to an even tougher economy and still some of those storm clouds that might be out there? Just kin d of your general \\nthinking about the other read -throughs of what lower rates quicker will mean for the broade r economy.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nWell first of all, I don't quite believe it. So the Fed has the rate curve, the forward short -term rate curve, almost at 1% higher than what the \\nmarket has. So one of the things you got to always prepare for is – it could be anything, we don't know what the rate curve is going to be in a \\nyear. And so we're quite cautious in that and quite thoughtful about that. Obviously, the short -term read is higher recessionary risk and then \\ninflation coming dow n. So I think inflation will come down a little bit, but it could easily be stickier than people think and therefore, the rat e \\ncurve will have to go up a little bit.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nKen Usdin  \\nAnalyst, Jefferies LLC Q \\nOkay. Thank you very much.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ................................................................................................. .... \\n \\nOperator:  Thank you. The next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. You may proceed.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................   \\nJohn McDonald  \\nAnalyst, Auton omous Research  Q \\nHi, thanks. Jeremy, wanted to follow up again on the drivers of the NII revision and the lower rates paid assumption. You men tioned the Fed \\ncuts coming sooner and positive feedback on the customer offers. What about the March events? Do t he bank failures there that happened in \\nMarch – in your view, do they slow the reprice intensity because folks are moving other than price reasons? Or they intensify it indu stry-wide \\nbecause smaller banks have to reprice to keep their deposits? How do thos e events influence your view of the reprice?  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. John, it's a really good question, and we've obviously thought about that. But as we sit here today, I guess I have two  answers to that. \\nOne is it's not meaningfully affecting our current outlook – we don't see it as  a major driver. And I think in terms of the larger dynamics that you \\nlay out, it's just a little too early to tell. But from where we are right now, the base case is no real impact.  \\n......................................................................... ............................................................................................................................. ............................  \\nJohn McDonald  \\nAnalyst, Autonomous Research  Q \\nOkay. And then I wanted to ask Jamie – there's a narrative out there that the industry could see a credit crunch – banks are going to stop \\nlending, even Jay Powell mentioned that as a risk. Do you see that in terms of anything you look at in terms of lending and i s that a reaction \\nthat makes sense – that banks might be retrenching a lot here? Do you worry about that for the economy in terms of credit crunch? Thanks.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ................ ....................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. I wouldn't use the word credit crunch if I were you. Obviously, there's going to be a little bit of tightening, and most of that will be around \\ncertain real estate things. And you've heard it from real estate investors already, so I just look at that as a kind of thumb  on the scale. It just \\nmakes the Fed's conditions be a little bit tighter , it increases the odds of a recession – that's what that is. It's not like a credit crunch.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ...................................... ...............................................................  \\n \\nOperator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. You may proceed.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\n7 \\n \\nErika Najarian  \\nAnalyst, UBS S ecurities LLC  Q \\nHi. Good morning. My first question is you mentioned that your reserve build was driven mostly by worse economic assumptions.  I'm \\nwondering if you could update us on what unemployment rate you're assuming in your reserve.  \\n................. ............................................................................................................................. ....................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. So, Erika, as you know, we take – not going to go into a lot of detail here – but we take the outlook from our economists, we run a \\nbunch of different scenarios and we probability -weight those. The central case outlook from ou r research team hasn't actually changed, but we \\nfelt that in line with what Jamie just said in terms of a little bit of tightening as a result of the events of March, it mad e sense to add a little bit of \\nweight to our relative adverse case. So we did that,  which changed the weighted -average expectation. And I think that the weighted -average \\npeak unemployment that we're using now is something like 5.8%.  \\n.......................................................................................................... ........................................................................................................................  \\nErika Najarian  \\nAnalyst, UBS Securities LLC  Q \\nSo, as you think about all of what you've just told us – so $81 billion of NII this year, and who knows when medium -term is going to happen of \\nmid-70s, the clear strength of the franchise producing 23% ROTCE in a quarter where your CET1 is 13.8% and a reserve that already  reflects \\n5.8% unemployment. As we think about recession and what JP Morgan can earn in a recession, do you think you can hit 17% ROTCE even in \\n2024 – assuming we do have a recession in 2024 as everybody is expecting – given all these revenue dynamics and how prepared you are on \\nthe reserve?  \\n................................ ............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. I mean that's an interesting question, Erika. I guess I'll say a couple things.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nIt's a great question, so I want to see how Jeremy answers it.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ......................... ............................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nOkay. Let's take a crack. Let's see what the boss thinks. I think number one, we believe, have said, and continue to believe that this is \\nfundamentally a 17% through the cycle ROTCE franchise, so number one. Number two, as Jamie always says, we run this company f or all \\ndifferent scenarios and to have it be as resilient as possible across all different scenari os. \\n \\nOn the particular question of ROTCE expectations in 2024 contingent on the particular economic outlook, obviously it depends a lot on the \\nnature of the recession. I think we feel really good about how the company is positioned for a recession, but we' re a bank. A very serious \\nrecession is of course going to be a headwind for returns, but we think even in a fairly severe recession, we'll deliver very  good returns – \\nwhether that's 17% or not is too much detail for now.  \\n................................... ............................................................................................................................. ..................................................................  \\nErika Najarian  \\nAnalyst, UBS Securities LLC  Q \\nThank you. \\n.................................................................................................................................... ..............................................................................................  \\n \\nOperator:  The next question comes f rom the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities.  You may proceed.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ..................................................... ................................................  \\n \\n8 \\n \\n \\nJim Mitchell  \\nAnalyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC  Q \\nHey. Good morning. Maybe just a little bit on the deposit, your thought process there. You've seen some inflows. Why do you t hink that you \\nlose them going forward? And just maybe talk a little bit about the dynamic in pricing – do you feel like given the inflows, do you see some \\npricing power for the larger banks?  \\n.................................................................................... ............................................................................................................................. .................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. A couple things there. So, first of all, we don't know. Right? The deposits just came in. We don't know. We're guessing. Number two, the \\ndeposits just came in. So, by definition, these are somewhat flighty deposits because they just came into us, so it's prudent  and appropriate for \\nus to assume that  they won't be particularly stable. Number three, there's a natural amount of internal migration of deposits to money funds so  \\nyou have to overlay that and that's embedded in our assumptions. And number four, it's a competitive market, and it's entirel y possible that \\npeople temporarily come to us and then over time decide to go elsewhere. So, for all of those reasons, we're just being reali stic about the \\nstickiness of it.  \\n...................................................................................... ............................................................................................................................. ...............  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nIf I add, I would say, categorically, there's no pricing power that the bigger banks have because if you look at the pricing – and we look at \\npricing sheets all the time – every bank is in a slightly different position and every bank is competing in three -month, six -month, nine -month \\nsavings rates. And then you have the online banks, you got treasury bills, you got money market funds. There's no pricing pow er for the bank, \\nbut obviously we all have different franchises and we're all in a slightly different position.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJim Mitchell  \\nAnalyst, Seaport  Global Securities LLC  Q \\nNo, fair – all fair points. And maybe just a follow -up on John's question on the lending environment. You talked about the industry likely pulling \\nback. Are you changing your underwriting standards in any way? Just trying to think  through is there potential for some market share gains \\ngiven your strength of capital and liquidity? Or how you're thinking about the loan environment?  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nI'd say very modestly, but we look at that all the time.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ............................... ......................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. And we always say, right, we underwrite through the cycle. And I think notably, we didn't loosen our underwriting standards when all the \\nnumbers looked crazy good during the pandemic, and we're not going to overreact now and tighten unreasonably. Some of that co rrection \\nhappens naturally – credit metrics deteriorate for borrowers whether in consumer or wh olesale, and that might make them leave our pre -\\nexisting risk appetite, but we're not running around aggressively tightening standards right now.  \\n.............................................................................................................. ....................................................................................................................  \\nJim Mitchell  \\nAnalyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC  Q \\nOkay. Great. Thanks.  \\n............................................................... ............................................................................................................................. ......................................  \\n \\nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\n \\n9 \\n \\nGerard Cassidy  \\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC  Q  \\nThank you. Hi, Jeremy.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .................................................................................... .................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nHey, Gerard.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nGerard Cassidy  \\nAnalyst, RBC C apital Markets LLC  Q \\nIn your comments about your CET1 ratio, obviously it came in strong at 13.8%. You've got the GSIB buffer obviously going up n ext year, and \\nwe have the stress test coming this summer or in June – the results – which maybe will lead to banks, including yours, having a higher Stress \\nCapital Buffer. Where should we think about that CET1 ratio being by the end of the year, do you think?  \\n......................................................................................................... .........................................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. So a few things on there, Gerard. So we have previously said that we were targeting 13.5% in the first quarter of 2024 as a function of \\nassuming an unchanged SCB, the increased GSIB step and operating with a 50 -basis -point buffer. So, the point that Jamie made a second \\nago, in light of the environment, Basel IV, dry  powder, you know, who knows how we'll tweak that going forward. But that's still our base case \\nassumption.  \\n \\nSpecifically on the stress test, contrary to what I've heard some people argue, our ability to predict the SCB ahead of time from running our \\nown p rocess is actually quite limited. And you'll remember last year that even though we did predict an increase, we were off by a lmost a \\nfactor of two in terms of how big it wound up being, and that was a big surprise for the whole industry. So, we want to be quite humble about \\nour ability to predict the SCB.  \\n \\nBut having said that, for right now we are assuming it will be unchanged. There are some tailwinds in there through the OCI, but we believe \\nthere will likely be some offsets and harsher credit shocks in t he number, so for planning purposes right now we're assuming flat for SCB, and \\nwe'll know soon enough what that actual number is.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nGerard Cassidy  \\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC  Q \\nSure. And then just as a follow -up, if I heard you correctly, can you give us a little more color – I think you mentioned in building the loan loss \\nreserve this quarter you identified some one -off credits? I don't know if that's how you said it – there's some larger credits. Were they \\ncommercial real estate oriented? Were they commercial? Any more color th ere? \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Fina ncial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nNo, it wasn't commercial real estate. It was just a couple of single name items in the Corporate segment.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nGerard Cassidy  \\nAnalyst, RBC C apital Markets LLC  Q \\nLeverage loan -type items or just regular Corporate credits?  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nRegular Corporate credits. I'd rather not get into too much detail...  \\n............................................................................................................................. ........................... ..........................................................................  \\n \\n10 \\n \\nGerard Cassidy  \\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC  Q \\nOkay, very good.  \\n................................................................................................................. .................................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\n…Gerard. Sorry. Thanks.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nGerard Cassidy  \\nAnalyst, RBC C apital Markets LLC  Q \\nThank you.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .................................................................................................. ... \\n \\nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may proceed.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nEbrahim H. Poonawala  \\nAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Q \\nHi, good morning. I guess, maybe one question, Jeremy. You reminded us of the relatively low office exposure for JPM. But, ob viously, you're \\nbig players in the CRE market. Just give us a sense of when you look at t he two pressure points on CRE, one, how much is oversupply – and \\nthat probably goes beyond office into apartments – how much of a issue is oversupply in the market as we think about the next few years \\ngoing into a weakening economy? And how much of a risk is higher for longer rates in that if the central banks can't cut rates in the next year \\nor two, we will see a ton of more pain because of the re -fi wall that's coming up?  \\n.................................................................................... ............................................................................................................................. .................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah, so Ebrahim let me sort of respond narrowly i n connection with our portfolio and our exposure, right? So, really, the large majority of our \\ncommercial real estate exposure is multi -family lending in supply constrained markets. And I think it's quite important to recognize the \\ndifference between that and sort of higher end, higher price point, non -rent controlled, not supply constrained markets. So, our space is really \\nquite different in that respect, and I think that's a big part of the reason the performance has been so good for so long.  \\n \\nSo, of cour se, we watch it very carefully and we don't assume that past performance predicts future results here, but I think our multi -family \\nlending portfolio is quite low risk in the scheme of things.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nCan I just add also, housing is in short supply in America. It's not massively oversupplied like you saw in 2008.  \\n............................................................................................. ............................................................................................................................. ........  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. And then in terms of the office space, as you know, o ur exposure is quite small. Yes, Jamie, has also mentioned all the re -fi dynamics \\nthat you mentioned too are something that the office space is processing one way or the other. Our office exposure is quite m odest, very \\nconcentrated in Class A buildings in sort of dense urban locations where the return to the office narrative is one of the drivers – is generally in \\nfavor of high occupancy. So, again, watching it. There are obviously specific things here and there to pay attention to, but in the scheme of \\nthings for us, not a big issue.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nEbrahim H. Poonawala  \\nAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Q \\nAnd just as a follow up, I think the other risk from higher for longer rates, I think, is this – the ability of the economy, the financial markets to \\nsustain a 5% less Fed fund for a long period of time? Like, what are the other areas you're watching if du ration mismatch and bank balance  \\n \\n11 \\n \\nEbrahim H. Poonawala  \\nAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Q \\nsheets being one, CRE market being one, are you worrying – worried about non -banks that have grown exponentially over the last decade in \\nterms of risks at the non -banks if rates don't get cut? And if you can talk to the transmission mechanism of that coming back and hitting banks \\ngiven the leverage that banks provide to the non -banks.  \\n.......................................................................... ............................................................................................................................. ...........................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah, so I'd like to answer tha t. So there is a risk of higher rates for longer. And don't just think of just the Fed Funds rate, because I think you \\nshould – for our planning – I'd be thinking more about it could be 6%. And then think about the five - and ten -year rate which could be 5% , and \\nI think if those things happen – I'm not saying they're going to happen – I just think people should prepare for them, they saw what just \\nhappened when rates went up beyond people's expectations. You had the gilt problem in London, you had some of th e banks here. People \\nneed to be prepared for the potential of higher rates for longer.  \\n \\nIf and when that happens, it will undress problems in the economy for those who are too exposed to floating rates, for those who are too \\nexposed to re -fi risk. Those ex posures will be in multiple parts of the economy. I say to all of our clients – now would be the time to fix it. Do \\nnot put yourself in a position where that risk is excessive for your company, your business, your investment pools, et cetera . That's answer  \\nnumber one.  \\n \\nNumber two is, it will not come back to JPMorgan. Okay? While we do provide credit to what you call shadow banks, it is very – we think – it's \\nvery, very secure. That does not mean it won't come back to other credit providers.  \\n............... ............................................................................................................................. ......................................................................................  \\nEbrahim H. Poonawala  \\nAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Q \\nGot it. Very helpful. Thank you.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ......................................................................... ............................  \\n \\nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ....................................................................................................  \\nMike Mayo  \\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo  Securities LLC  Q \\nHey Jeremy, you mentioned a degree of reintermediation to the lending markets. You said capital markets activity has gone to bank lending, \\nand I'm just wondering, as part of your $7 billion increased NII guide, are you assuming better lo an spreads? And on the topic of loan pricing, \\nwhy aren't your credit card yields going higher than where they are today? Thanks.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah, Mike. So I think, yeah, you're referring to my comments that I made in the Commercial Bank about the fact that the larger Corporate \\nsegment within the Commercial Bank that would generally have access to capital markets but also access to bank lending, at th e margin is \\nchoosing to draw down revolvers right now rather than access t he capital markets. That is not a particularly meaningful driver of the increase \\nin NII guidance. There's a lot of odds and ends in there, but the major drivers are the ones that I called out.  \\n \\nAnd to be honest, I haven't actually specifically checked what 's happening with Card yields. I would imagine that they've gone up a little bit in \\nline with rates, but I don't know. We should follow up here.  \\n............................................................................................................... ...................................................................................................................  \\nMike Mayo  \\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC  Q \\nAll right. And then one for you, Jamie. I guess taking the 10,000 foot level, I guess, when  you look at asset liability management, or ALM – you \\ncould call this nightmare on ALM street, and you've seen some big problems at banks, and I guess how would you evaluate yours elf, I guess, \\nwith this $7 billion higher NII guide? It probably is good, but  to what degree are you willing to sacrifice JPM shareholder money to help rescue \\nproblem banks that did not get their asset liability management correctly?  \\n................................................................................................... ............................................................................................................................. .. \\n \\n12 \\n \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nWell, it's two really different questions. So we've been quite cautious on interest rates for quite a while, and how we invest our portfolio, what \\nour expectations are, our stress testing. The stress test – the CCAR stress test, as you know, had rates going down. I always looked at rates \\ngoing up and being prepared – whether or not anything is going to happen. So we've been quite conservative ourselves and we don't mind \\ncontinuing to do that because I remind people that having excess capital, you haven't lost it. It's kind of earnings in store  – you get to d eploy it \\nlater and maybe at a more opportune time, when the time comes.  \\n \\nAnd look, we like to help the system when it needs help, if we can reasonably. And we're not the only ones, you saw a lot of banks do that, \\nand I was proud of them. I think all of us did the right thing. Whether ultimately it works out or not, well, you could second -guess that when it \\nhappens. But the fact is, I think people want to help the system. And this whole banking thing was bad for banks. And I knew that the second I \\nsaw the he adline, and then you had Credit Suisse. We want healthy community banks. We want healthy regional banks. We want to help them  \\nget through this.  \\n \\nWe have, you'll remember, Mike, as you point out, we have the best financial system the world's ever seen. That  does not mean it won't have \\nproblems, doesn't mean there shouldn't be changes made, but I think it's reasonable for people to help each other in times of  need. And we all \\ndid that – all of us – did that during COVID. All of us did that – if you could, tho se who could – did it during the Great Financial Crisis, and I \\nwould expect people to do that going forward.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nMike Mayo  \\nAnalyst, Wells Farg o Securities LLC  Q \\nHey Jamie, your CEO letter said the banking crisis isn't over. So, what do you mean by that? Or was that dated two weeks late r? Are you \\ntalking contagion or what?  \\n......................................................................... ............................................................................................................................. ............................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. So it's just – the number of banks offsides you can count on your hands, in terms of too much interest rate exposure, too much ATM, \\ntoo much uninsured deposits. And so there may be additional bank failures, something like that, which we don't know. But you' re going to see \\nnext week regional banks have pretty good numbers. A lot of people are going to have – can take – actions to remediate some of the issues \\nthey may have going forward.  \\n \\nYou've already seen things calm down quite a bit, particularly in deposit flows. Warren Bu ffett was on TV talking about that he would bet $1 \\nmillion – I don't know if you saw that – that no depositor will lose money in America. That he's willing to bet his own money. And of course, you \\nknow he's a very bright man. So, this crisis is not 2008. I t will pass. And the one thing I pointed out is, when I answered the question just \\nbefore about interest rates – people need to be prepared. They shouldn't pray that they don't go up. They should prepare for them going up. \\nAnd if it doesn't happen, serendi pity. \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nMike Mayo  \\nAnalyst, Well s Fargo Securities LLC  Q \\nAll right.

You're back now.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .......................................................................... ...........................  \\nBetsy L. Graseck  \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nOkay. So I just wanted to unpack the higher for longer rate possibility as to how it impacts your NII because your NII guide is assuming the \\nforward curve, if I understand co rrectly. So, in the event that you get that higher for longer, just how much does that impact NII ex. Markets \\nbecause I'm trying to triangulate here about – maybe you lose some deposits, but if we have higher for longer, shouldn't we expect the \\ntrajectory goes up from this quarter as opposed to down? Is that – that's the question.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ...................................................... ...............................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

And I would say that if you look at the evolution of our outlook last year, it w as pretty clear that we \\nwere very asset -sensitive, certainly in terms of the sort of one  year forward EaR type measure. You also obviously know that our current EaR \\nactually shows a slight negative number, so a tiny bit liability sensitive, and I won't get into all the nuances about why th at may or may not be a \\ngreat predictor in the short -term. But the point is that the level of rates now is of course very different from what it was last year. And at this \\nlevel of rates, the relationship between our short -term NII evolution and the curve is not always going to be clear in any given moment.  \\n \\nIt's quite tricky, and it can behave in somewhat wonky ways as a function of, again, what I've alluded to a couple times on th is call – the \\ncompetitive environment for deposits, which is not, in fact, a sort of mathematically predictable thing as a function  of the rate curve. So, that's \\nwhy we're emphasizing all the different drivers of uncertainty in the NII outlook. Yeah.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ........... ..........................................................................................  \\n \\n14 \\n \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. So I'll just add, so next quarter we all kind of know already. Two quarters out, we know a little bit less. Three quart ers out, we know a \\nlittle bit less. And 2024, we know very little. That number, you could imagine – this is a little inside basebal l now – the number that we're \\ntalking about for 2024 is not based upon an implied curve. It's based upon us looking at multiple potential scenarios, leveli ng them kind of out \\nand saying this is kind of a range.  \\n \\nAnd you're absolutely correct. You could ha ve an environment of higher for longer that might be better than that, but remember, higher for \\nlonger comes with a lot of other things attached to it – like maybe a recession, stagflation, lower volumes. So I wouldn't look at that as higher \\nfor longer is a positive. It might be a slight positive on that line. It would probably would be a negative on other lines.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ..................... ................................................................................  \\nBetsy L. Graseck  \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nYeah. Got it. Okay, that's super helpful to understand how you think through that. And then the follow -up is just on the buybacks. So do I take \\nyour comments to mean that you're on pause now? And if that's the case, what would be the driver of restarting?  \\n..................................................................................................................... .............................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. No. We're not on pause now. We're doing a little bit now. We obviously have a lot of excess capital. We also like to buy our stock when \\nit's cheap, not just when it's available. And we're also peering ahead, looking at those little bit of storm clouds so we're going to be kind of \\ncautious. So we're going to make thi s decision every day. We also don't like to tell the market what we're doing, just so you know.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ................................... ..................................................................  \\nBetsy L. Graseck  \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nYeah. And then can you give us any sense of what Basel IV endgame means to you in your RWAs? How much should we be baking in for \\nthose?  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah, Betsy, we really don't have any new information there, right? I mean, I think clearly if you go back like a year, we we re maybe a little bit \\nmore optimistic that it might be across all the different levers a nd all the different pieces of it, closer to capital neutral. I think now it feels like \\nit’s likely to be worse than that. Hopefully, it’s not too much worse than that. And I would just remind you that there are a  lot of different levers, \\nso when the NPR c omes, that's only going to be a part of it, there's going to be other pieces – the holistic review. And it's going to take a lot of \\ntime to phase in and we're going to have time to adjust. So we'll know when we know.  \\n....................................... ............................................................................................................................. ..............................................................  \\nBetsy L. Graseck  \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nGot it.  \\n................................................................................................................................... ...............................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Execut ive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nAnd there were supposed – I just remembered, there were supposed to be pauses in there about how they looked at banks relative to the \\nglobal economy, which are getting smaller. The G -SIFI was supposed to be adjusted for  that. So, it may very – we're expecting it go up, but \\nthere are a lot of reasons why it shouldn't go up. And JPMorgan – there's so much capital. I mean, so you can't look at JPMorgan and say, \\nwell, it's a capital issue. And even the banks, by the way, whe n you look at it – even though some of the banks that are in trouble, they have \\nplenty of capital. Their issue wasn't capital, it was other things. And so I'm just hoping regulators are very thoughtful.  \\n \\nAnd the other thing is they should a priori decide what they want out of the banking system at this point because I've made it clear – I can look \\nat the banking system and say that no bank should keep a loan, if possible. That's how much capital is now being required for  loans.  \\n..................... ............................................................................................................................. ................................................................................  \\n \\n15 \\n \\nBetsy L. Graseck  \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nThis is based on the current rule set.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ........................................................................................ .............  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah, because the market is pricing holds. The market would take loans at much lower capital ratio than banks are being force d to hold for \\nthem. I'm talking about just lo ans only. So that's why you're seeing a lot of capital go to – I mean a lot of credit go to non -banks, and \\ndramatically, by the way. Rapidly and dramatically. And so if you're a regulator, you should be looking at it and saying, do I want that? Is that a \\ngood thing for the system? If you believe it's a good thing for the system, raise the capital and more credit will go out of t he system. That's fine. \\nIf that's what they want, that's fine. But they should do it with a forethought, not accidentally.  \\n........ ............................................................................................................................. .............................................................................................  \\nBetsy L. Graseck  \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nI like the NII from loans better than the gain on sale, so I'll prefer the former not the latter. But thanks, appreciate it.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYes. \\n............................................................................................................................. ................................................................................... ..................  \\n \\nOperator:  Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .................................................................................................... . \\nGlenn Schorr  \\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI  Q \\nThank you. So you talked about in your letter about regulators avoiding the knee -jerk reaction, which you addressed earlier. I'm curious on \\nyour thoughts around how customers have reacted and should react. Now my point, my question is – consumers can move excess cash \\nbalances if they want more insurance. They can do that in a lot of different ways: move it, treasuries, money market, extra a ccounts, whatever. \\nThe issue, the question I have for you is on the corporate side. Have you seen big c hanges in how corporate treasurers or CFOs are adapting \\ntheir cash balances and working capital – and should they need to? And I appreciate your Warren Buffett comments.  \\n...................................................................................... ............................................................................................................................. ...............  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah, Glenn, in short, we really haven't seen big ch anges to speak of. And I do think it's just worth saying – I think you're sort of hinting at this \\na little bit when you talk about the behavior of corporates – that when we talk about responses to the recent events through the lens of \\nuninsured deposits, t hat's obviously very different if you're talking about large balances of non -operating uninsured deposits from financial \\ninstitutions or de facto financial institutions versus normal large corporate operating balances, which is, of course, like c ore bankin g business \\nfor all of us.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nWhen we saw it in Commercial Banking, Payments, Investment Banking and Custody, you did see money move – or I would call excess cash \\nwas moved out. But they have options. What I would call more like operational cash –  so think even of a small companies, middle market \\ncompanies, et cetera – that tends to be fairly sticky because you have your loans there, you have your money there, you're getting more and \\nmore competitive in rates . And that's why I think you see lot of regional banks – they've got sticky middle market deposits.  \\n \\nIf I lent you $30 million and you have $10 million, you're probably going to leave it at my bank. And they also are more comp etitive on the rate \\nfor that. So, I think you shouldn't be looking at deposit like one class – there's a whole bunch of different types, and analytically you go through \\neach one and try to figure out what the stickiness is, and what the stickiness is and et cetera and so on. But I thin k they have already – as the \\nFed has raised rates, you've already seen – that's the reason we expected outflows both from consumers and corporate customers.  \\n................................................................................................... ............................................................................................................................. .. \\n \\n16 \\n \\nGlenn Schorr  \\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI  Q \\nInteresting. Just follow -up, the other thing that caught my eye in the letter is you mentioned that you're exploring new capital optimization \\nstrategies including partnerships and securitizations. What's different than what you've already been doing for the last 30 y ears?  \\n.................................................................... ............................................................................................................................. .................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nWe've got our smartest pe ople, we’re going to figure out every angle to reduce capital requirements for JPMorgan. That's the difference. And \\nwe've been doing it, but there's securitizations, there are partnerships. You're seeing a lot of the private equity do the li fe insurance \\ncompanies, and I expect that we're going to come up with a whole bunch of different things over time. And we'll shed certain as sets, too.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nGlenn Schorr  \\nAnalyst, Evercor e ISI  Q \\nYeah. Thanks, Jamie.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\nOperator:  Our final question  comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ........................................................ ............................................  \\nMatt O'Connor  \\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.  Q \\nGood morning. You guys talked about one of the drivers of the higher net interest income guide this year is due to likely hig her credit card \\nbalances. And I was just wondering if you could flush out what changed there on the outlook today versus three months ago. An d I guess, is it \\na good or bad thing that those balances will be higher than you thought?  \\n......................................... ............................................................................................................................. ............................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. S o the story there is kind of the same story we've been talking about for a while. It's just a matter of degree. So we had rev olving \\nbalances obviously drop a lot during the pandemic period and then we talked about having them recover in absolute dollar ter ms to the same \\nlevel as we'd had pre -pandemic, which I think happened last quarter. And then the remaining narrative is just the further normalization of the \\nrevolve per -account, because we also have seen some account growth, and that continues to happen. And so also, to Mike's question earlier, \\nwe're seeing a higher yield there as well.  \\n \\nSo, and on your question of whether it's good or bad, obviously there's a point at which the consumers have too much leverage . We don't see \\nthat yet, so.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nIt's normalization.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ........................................................................................... ..........  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nIt's a good thing for us.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\n17 \\n \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nMatt O'Connor  \\nAnalyst, Deutsc he Bank Securities, Inc.  Q \\nOkay. And then just separately to squeeze in – you guys took some securities losses again this quarter. And in the past you've talked about \\nreally just going security -by-security looking for, kind of, pricing opportunities. Is that kind of what drove it again this quarter, or is there some \\nkind of broader, overarching…  \\n............................................................................................................................. ................... ..................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nThat'll be every quarter for the rest of our lives. Sell what we find rich, and we buy what we think is dear...  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nCheap . \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nCheap . \\n............................................................................................................................. ................................................................................. ....................  \\nMatt O'Connor  \\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.  Q \\nOkay. All right. Thank you.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\nOperator:  We have no further questions.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ....................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.   \\nExcellent. Folks, thank you very much.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ................................ .....................................................................  \\n \\nOperator:  That concludes today's conference.

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. This call is being \\nrecorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go to the live presentation. Please stand by.  \\n \\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon and Chief Financial Office r, Jeremy \\nBarnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  \\nThanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in  the back. \\nStarting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $14.5 billion, EPS of $4.75 on revenue of $42.4 billion, and delivered an ROTCE of 25%. \\nThese results included the First Republic bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion, a credit reserve build for the First Republi c lending portfolio of \\n$1.2 billion as well as $900 millio n of net investment securities losses in Corporate. Touching on a few highlights: CCB client investment \\nassets were up 18% year -on-year, we had record long -term inflows in AWM, and we ranked number one in IB fee wallet share.  \\n \\nBefore giving you more detail  on the financials, let me give you a brief update on the status of the First Republic integration on page 2. The \\nsettlement process with the FDIC is on schedule with a number of key milestones being recently completed. Systems integration  is also \\nproceedi ng apace and we are targeting being substantially complete by mid -2024. First Republic employees have formally joined us as of July \\n2nd and we're pleased to have had very high acceptance rates on our offers. And although it's still early days, as we get th e sales force back in \\nthe market we are happy to see that client retention is strong with about $6 billion of net deposit inflows since the acquisi tion. \\n \\nNow turning back to this quarter's results on page 3. You'll see that in various parts of the presenta tion, we have specifically called out the \\nimpact of First Republic where relevant. To make things easier, I'm going to start by discussing the overall impact of First Republic on this \\nquarter's results at the Firmwide level. Then, for the rest of the prese ntation, I will generally exclude the impact of First Republic in order to \\nimprove comparability with prior periods. With that in mind, in this quarter First Republic contributed $4 billion of revenue , $599 million of \\nexpense, and $2.4 billion of net incom e. As noted on the first page, this includes $2.7 billion of bargain purchase gain which is reflected in NIR \\nin the Corporate segment, as well as $1.2 billion of allowance build. And remember that the deal happened on May 1st, so the First Republic \\nnumbers  only represent two months of results.  \\n \\nYou'll see in the line of business results that we are showing First Republic revenue and allowance in CCB, CB and AWM. And f or the \\npurposes of this quarter's results, all of the deposits are in CCB and substantially  all of the expenses are in Corporate. As the integration \\ncontinues, some of those items will get allocated across the segments. Now, turning back to Firmwide results excluding First Republic. \\nRevenue of $38.4 billion was up $6.7 billion or 21% year -on-year. NII ex. Markets was up $7.8 billion or 57%, driven by higher rates. NIR ex. \\nMarkets was down $293 million , largely driven by the net investment securities losses I mentioned earlier, partially offset by a number of less \\nnotable items primarily in the pr ior year. And Markets revenue was down $772 million or 10% year -on-year. Expenses of $20.2 billion were up \\n$1.5 billion or 8% year -on-year, primarily driven by higher compensation expense, including wage inflation and higher legal expense. And \\ncredit costs  of $1.7 billion included net charge -offs of $1.4 billion , predominantly in Card.  \\n \\nThe net reserve build included a $389 million build in the Commercial Bank, a $200 million build in Card, and a $243 million release in \\nCorporate, all of which I will cover in more detail later. On to balance sheet and capital on page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of \\n13.8%, flat versus the prior quarter as the benefit of net income less distributions was offset by the impact of First Republ ic. And as you can \\nsee i n the two charts on the page, we've given you some information about the impact of the transaction on both RWA and CET1 ratio . And as \\nyou know, we completed CCAR a couple of weeks ago. Our new indicative SCB is 2.9% versus our current requirement of 4% and  it goes into \\neffect in 4Q23. The new SCB also reflects the board's intention to increase the dividend to $1.05 per share in the third quar ter. \\n \\nOn liquidity, our Bank LCR for the second quarter ended at 129%, in line with what we anticipated at Investor D ay. About half of the reduction \\nis associated with the First Republic transaction. And while we're on the balance sheet, as we previewed in the 10 -K, we will be updating our \\nEarnings at Risk model to incorporate the impact of deposit repricing lags. So whe n we release this quarter's 10 -Q, you will see the up 100 -\\nbasis point parallel shift scenario will be about positive $2.5 billion whereas in the absence of the change it would have be en about negative \\n$1.5 billion. Now let's go to our businesses starting w ith CCB on page 5. Both U.S. consumers and small businesses remain resilient and we \\nhaven't observed any meaningful changes to the trends in our data we discussed at Investor Day. Turning now to the financial results which I \\nwill speak to excluding the imp act of First Republic for CCB, CB and AWM. CCB reported net income of $5 billion on revenue of $16.4 billion, \\nwhich was up 31% year -on-year.  \\n \\nIn Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 59% year -on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. End -of-period deposits were down \\n4% quarter -on-quarter , as customers continue to spend down their cash buffers, including for seasonal tax payments, and seek higher -yielding \\n \\n3 \\n \\nproducts. Client investment assets were up 18% year -on-year, driven by market performance and strong net inflows across our advisor and \\ndigital channels. In Home Lending, revenue was down 23% year -on-year, driven by lower NII from tighter loan spreads and lower servicing \\nand production revenue. Ori ginations were up quarter -on-quarter , driven by seasonality, although still down 54% year -on-year. Moving to Card \\nServices & Auto, revenue was up 5% , largely driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower auto \\nlease income.  \\n \\nCard outstandings were up 18% year -on-year, which was the result of revolve normalization and strong new account growth. And in Auto, \\noriginations were up $12 billion, up 71% year -on-year as competitors pull back and inventories continue to sl owly recover. Expenses of $8.3 \\nbillion were up 8% year -on-year, driven by compensation, predominantly due to wage inflation and headcount growth as we continue to invest \\nin our front office and technology staffing as well as marketing. In terms of credit p erformance this quarter, our credit costs were $1.5 billion, \\nreflecting a reserve build of $203 million driven by loan growth in Card Services. Net charge -offs were $1.3 billion, up $640 million year -on-\\nyear, predominantly driven by Card as 30 day -plus del inquencies have returned to pre -pandemic levels, in line with our expectations.  \\n \\nNext, the CIB on page 6. CIB reported net income of $4.1 billion on revenue of $12.5 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $ 1.5 billion was \\nup 11% year -on-year or down 7% exc luding bridge book markdowns in the prior year. IB fees were down 6% year -on-year and we ranked \\nnumber one with year -to-date wallet share of 8.4%. In Advisory, fees were down 19%. Underwriting fees were down 6% for debt and up 30% \\nfor equity with more posi tive momentum in the last month of the quarter. In terms of the second half outlook, we have seen encouraging signs \\nof activity in Capital Markets and July should be a good indicator for the remainder of the year. However, year -to-date announced M&A is \\ndown significantly, which will be a headwind.  \\n \\nMoving to Markets, total revenue was $7 billion, down 10% year -on-year. Fixed Income was down 3%. As expected, the macro franchise \\nsubstantially normalized from last year's elevated levels of volatility and clien t flows. This was largely offset by improved performance in the \\nSecuritized Products Group and Credit. Equity Markets was down 20% against a very strong prior -year quarter, particularly in derivatives. \\nPayments revenue was $2.5 billion, up 61% year -on-year. Excluding equity investments, it was up 32%, predominantly driven by higher rates, \\npartially offset by lower deposit balances. Securities Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 6% year -on-year, driven by higher rates, partially \\noffset by lower fees. Exp enses of $6.9 billion were up 1% year -on-year, driven by higher non -compensation expense as well as wage inflation \\nand headcount growth, largely offset by lower revenue -related compensation.  \\n \\nMoving to the Commercial Bank on page 7. Commercial Banking repo rted net income of $1.5 billion. Revenue of $3.8 billion was up 42% \\nyear-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins. Payments revenue of $2.2 billion was up 79% year -on-year, driven by higher rates. Gross \\nInvestment Banking and Markets revenue of $767 milli on was down 3% year -on-year, primarily driven by fewer large M&A deals. Expenses of \\n$1.3 billion were up 12% year -on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation expense, including front office hiring and technology \\ninvestments, as well as higher volu me-related expense. Average deposits were up 3% quarter -on-quarter, driven by inflows related to new \\nclient acquisition, partially offset by continued attrition in non -operating deposits. Loans were up 2% quarter -on-quarter. C&I loans were up \\n2%, reflectin g stabilization in new loan demand and revolver utilization in the current economic environment, as well as pockets of growth  in \\nareas where we are investing.  \\n \\nCRE loans were also up 1%, reflecting funding on prior -year originations for construction loans in Real Estate Banking as well as increased \\naffordable housing activity. Finally, credit costs were $489 million. Net charge -offs were $100 million, including $82 million in the office real \\nestate portfolio and the net reserve build of $389 million was dri ven by updates to certain assumptions related to the office real estate market \\nas well as net downgrade activity in Middle Market Banking. Then, to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 8. Asset & W ealth \\nManagement reported net income of $1.1 billion  with pre -tax margin of 32%. Revenue of $4.6 billion was up 8% year -on-year, driven by higher \\ndeposit margins on lower balances and higher management fees on strong net inflows. Expenses of $3.2 billion were up 8% year -on-year, \\ndriven by higher compensatio n, including growth in our private banking advisor teams, higher revenue -related compensation, and the impact \\nof Global Shares and J.P. Morgan Asset Management in China, both of which closed within the last year.  \\n \\nFor the quarter, record net long -term infl ows were $61 billion, positive across all channels, regions, and asset classes, led by Fixed Income \\nand Equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $60 billion. AUM of $3.2 trillion was up 16% year -on-year and overall client assets of $4.6 \\ntrillion w ere up 20% year -on-year, driven by continued net inflows, higher market levels, and the impact of the acquisition of Global Shares. \\nAnd finally, loans were down 1% quarter -on-quarter, driven by lower securities -based lending and deposits were down 6%. Turn ing to \\nCorporate on page 9. As I noted upfront, we are reporting the First Republic bargain purchase gain and substantially all of t he expenses in \\nCorporate. Excluding those items, Corporate reported net income of $339 million. Revenue was $985 million, up  $905 million compared to last \\nyear.  \\n \\nNII was $1.8 billion, up $1.4 billion year -on-year due to the impact of higher rates. NIR was a net loss of $782 million and included the net \\ninvestment securities losses I mentioned upfront. Expenses of $590 million were up $384 million year -on-year, largely driven by higher legal \\nexpense. And credit costs were a net benefit of $243 million, reflecting a reserve release as the deposit placed with First R epublic in the first \\nquarter was eliminated as part of th e transaction. Next, the outlook on page 10. We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex. Markets to be \\napproximately $87 billion, with the increase driven by higher rates coupled with slower deposit reprice than previously assum ed across both \\nConsumer and Wholesale . And I should take the opportunity to remind you once again that significant sources of uncertainty remain and we \\ndo expect the NII run rate to be substantially below this quarter's run rate at some point in the future as competition for d eposits plays ou t. \\n \\n4 \\n \\n \\nOur expense outlook for 2023 remains approximately $84.5 billion. And on credit, we continue to expect the 2023 Card net char ge-off rate to \\nbe approximately 2.6%. So to wrap up, we are proud of the exceptionally strong operating results this quarter. A s we look forward, we remain \\nfocused on the significant uncertainties relating to the economic outlook, competition for deposits, and the impact on capita l from the pending \\nfinalization of the Basel III rules. Nonetheless, despite the likely headwinds ahea d, we remain optimistic about the company's ability to \\ncontinue delivering excellent performance through a range of scenarios.  \\n \\nWith that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\n \\nQUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION  \\n  \\nOperator : Please stand by. The first question is coming from the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. You may proceed.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJim Mitchell  \\nAnalyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC  Q \\nThanks. Good morning. Hey, Jeremy, you talked about NII guidance up. Clearly, Fed Funds futures are up so it makes some sense. But \\nmaybe I guess first, could you kind of discuss – I guess comment on deposit behavior broadly around betas and mix and what you're seeing \\nthere so far? It seems to be coming in a little better than expected. And th en secondly, and probably more importantly, can you help us think \\nabout the implications of higher -for-longer rates on the outlook for NII next year and beyond? I guess the intermediate term outlook that you \\nguys had talked about?  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Fin ancial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah, sure. Thanks, Jim. So, yeah, so when we talk about the drivers of the upward revision, as I said, it's higher rates cou pled with lower \\ndeposit reprice; hard to untangle the two drivers. And specifically, I think when you look at Consumer, the combination of the passage of time \\nand the positive feedback we're getting from the field and the CD offerings in particular has meant that it's quite a kind of  stable environment \\nfrom that perspective. And similarly, in Wholesale we're just seeing slower internal migrations. You asked about mix. I think that obviously, \\nwe're seeing the CD mix increase and we would expect that to continue to take place probably even past the peak of the rate c ycle into ne xt \\nyear as we continue to capture money in motion. But as you say, the most important point is the fact that, as I said earlier,  we don't consider \\nthis level of NII generation to be sustainable.  \\n \\nAnd we talked previously about a sort of medium -term run rat e in the mid -70s. That was before First Republic, and you could argue that \\nmaybe that number should be a little higher. But whatever it is, it's a lot lower than the current number. We don't know when  that's going to \\nhappen. We're not going to predict the exact moment; that's going to be a function of competitive dynamics in the marketplace. But we want to \\nbe clear that we do expect it at some point.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJim Mitchell  \\nAnalyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC  Q \\nOkay. But I guess just one follow -up on that. Just if we don't get rate cuts till middle of next year or later, does that sort of give some \\nconfidence to the outlook for next year or are you still worried about significant reprice?  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nI wou ldn't necessarily assume that the evolution from the current run rate into that mid -70s number is that sensitive to the rate outlook in \\nparticular. When we put that number out there, we looked at a range of different types of rate environments and the repr ice that we think would \\nbe associated with that. It was really meant to capture more of what we consider to be a through -the-cycle sustainable number, so I wouldn't \\nthink of it as being particularly rate -dependent.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJim Mitchell  \\nAnalyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC  Q \\nOkay. Great. Thanks.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\n \\n5 \\n \\nOperator:  Next, we'll go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. You may proceed.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nErika Najarian  \\nAnalyst, UBS Securities LLC  Q \\nHi. Good morning. Jeremy, I'm just laughing to myself because I said to you at Investor Day – do you have any more NII rabbits to pull out of \\nthe hat, and I guess you do. So I guess, I want to ask a broader question really here. And maybe, Jamie, I'd like to get your  thoughts. So you \\nearned 23% ROTCE on 13.8% CET1, and we hear you  loud and clear that you're more normalized NII generation is not $87 billion. That being \\nsaid, and fully taking into account the potential haircut from Basel III Endgame, is it possible that your natural ROTCE is m aybe above that \\n17% through -the-cycle rat e when rates aren't zero? Because when you first introduced that ROTCE target, we were in a different world from a \\nrate scenario and everybody's talking about even if the Fed cuts, the natural sort of bottom in Fed funds is not going to be zero. So any inp ut \\non that would be great.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. Thanks, Erika. I mean, it's a good question. There's a lot in there, obviously. I guess I would start by saying that wh en we talked about \\nthe 17% through -the-cycle ROTCE, even though we may have introduced that in a moment when we were at the lower zero bound, it was \\nalways premised on a sort of normalized rate environment, and at some level that remains true today. Furthermore, you didn't ask this \\nexplicitly, but in the context of the proposed Basel III Endgame, one relevant question might be if you have a lot more capital in the \\ndenominator, what happens to that target? So I think as I said in my prepared remarks, we feel very confident about the compa ny's abi lity to \\nproduce excellent returns through the cycle. There's a lot of moving parts right now in that; some of them could be good, som e of them could \\nbe bad.  \\n \\nNarrowly, on the capital one, the one thing to point out is that the straight -up math of simply di luting down the ROTCE by expanding the \\ndenominator misses the possibility of reprice, repricing of products and services, which of course goes back to our point tha t these capital \\nincreases do have impacts on the real economy. So we're not suggesting that we can price our way out of it, but we obviously need to get the \\nright returns on products and services, and where we have pricing power we will adjust to the higher capital. So a lot of mov ing parts in there, \\nbut I think the important point is that throug h a range of scenarios we feel good about our ability to deliver good results. And we'll see how the \\nmix of all the various factors plays out especially after we see the Basel III proposal and then go through the comment perio d. \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Ch ief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nAnd Erika, I would just add one thing. We do have a mix of businesses that earn from like 0% ROTCE to 100%. We have some whic h are very \\ncapital -intensive so we look at kind of all of them, and I think 17% is a good number and a good target. The other thing we're over -earning on \\nis credit. We've been over -earning on credit for a substantial amount of time now, we're quite conscious about it. We know that it's going to \\npick up just as it normalizes, considerably  more than now. Look, we would consider credit card normalizing to be closer to 3.5%.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nErika Najarian  \\nAnalyst, UBS S ecurities LLC  Q \\nAnd so my follow -up question there. Maybe, Jeremy, could you remind us what unemployment rate is embedded in your ACL ratio as of the \\nsecond quarter?  \\n......................................................................................... ............................................................................................................................. ............  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. It’s still 5.8% . \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nErika Najarian  \\nAnalyst, UBS Securities LLC  Q \\nThank you.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ......................................................................................... ............  \\n \\nOperator:  Next, we'll go to the line of John McDonald from Autonomous Research. You may proceed.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................   \\n \\n6 \\n \\nJohn McDonald  \\nAnalyst, Autonomous Research  Q  \\nHi. Good morning. Jeremy, wanted to ask about capital in the wake of the Barr speech. We don't have the details yet, but just  kind of wanted \\nto ask about options that you have and strategies for mitigation both on RWA and p otentially on the GSIB front as well as you contemplate \\nwhat you heard recently.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .................................................. ...................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. Thanks, John. So obviously, we're thinking about that a lot. On the other hand, as much as there have been a lot of ver y detailed \\nrumors out there that might lead you to start to try to do some planning, it does seem like this time it's real and we are ac tually going to get a \\nproposal presumably sometime this month or something. So soon enough, we'll get to see something act ually on paper and we can stop kind \\nof the guesswork. Having said that, indulging in a little bit of guesswork, it does seem like the biggest single driver of th e increase that people \\nare talking about, including Chair Powell's 20% number or Vice Chair Bar r’s 2% of RWA which winds up being roughly the same, is just the \\nway operational risk is getting introduced into the Standardized pillar. And that is a little bit of a straight -up, across -the-board tax on everything.  \\n \\nIt's kind of hard to optimize your way out of that, with the exception obviously of the fact that you can simply increase price, assuming you \\nhave pricing power, but that's obviously not what we want and that's what we sort of mean by impacts on the real economy. So there are \\ndetails, there  is a lot of the FRTB stuff; we can get way into the weeds there within the Markets business. And we do have a good track reco rd \\nof adjusting and optimizing, but this time around, it may be a more fundamental set of questions around business mix as oppos ed to the ability \\nto sort of optimize in a very technical way . \\n............................................................................................................................. ...................................................................... ...............................  \\nJohn McDonald  \\nAnalyst, Autonomous Research  Q \\nOkay. That's helpful. And with a number of years for this to phase in and you generating capital at a high level even if the ROTCE comes \\ndown a bit, how should we think about you r pace of building capital for these new changes versus doing your everyday course of investing and \\nbuybacks and things like that over the next couple years?  \\n.................................................................................................. ............................................................................................................................. .. \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. I mean, I guess I'm sort of tempted to give you our standard capital hierarchy here. I mean, we're not going to sacrifice investments, \\nright? That won't come as a surprise to you. Generally speaking, we're always going to try to comply with new requirements ea rly. So when we \\nknow the requirements and when w e have visibility, obviously given how much organic capital we're generating right now, whatever the \\nanswer winds up being it'll be pretty easy to comply, narrowly speaking. But that's not the same as saying that there won't b e consequences to \\nreturns or t o pricing. And if for whatever reason things aren't exactly as we're anticipating, I don't see us sacrificing investments tha t we see as \\nstrategically critical in order to comply with higher capital requirements ahead of the formal timing or whatever.  \\n................................................................................................................................. .................................................................................................  \\nJohn McDonald  \\nAnalyst, Autonomous  Research  Q \\nOkay. And there's some room for buybacks?  \\n............................................................................................................................. ....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nIt's unlikely, obviously. That would be an unlikely outcome.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .................................... .................................................................  \\nJohn McDonald  \\nAnalyst, Autonomous Research  Q \\nOkay. Thank you.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ....................................................................................................  \\n \\n \\n7 \\n \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financia l Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nSorry, John. Go ahead. Did you have a follow -up? \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJohn McDonald  \\nAnalyst, Autono mous Research  Q \\nYeah. No, just do buybacks play a role in the next couple years strategically? Do you episodically buy back?  \\n............................................................................................................................. ....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nI mean, capital hierarchy again, right? In the end, when we have nothing else to do with the money, we'll do buybacks. And we  talked about \\nthe $12 billion for this year. Obviously a lot of new moving parts there. Although all else equal, given what we've done so far, that's still \\nprobably a reasonable number for the full year. But, yeah, that's always going to be at the end of the list. But, yeah.  \\n............................................................................. ............................................................................................................................. ........................  \\nJohn McDonald  \\nAnalyst, Autonomous Research  Q \\nGot it. Okay. Thank you.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ....................................................................................................  \\n \\nOperator:  Next, we'll go to the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. You may proceed.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ............................................................................ .........................  \\nKen Usdin  \\nAnalyst, Jefferies LLC  Q \\nThanks. Good morning. I just wanted to ask a little bit about how you're feeling about the trade -off between like the commercial economy and \\nwhat might come through in terms of future loan growt h versus the kind of green shoots that people are talking about in the Investment \\nBanking pipeline and just how it feels in terms of like re -opening of markets and the trade -off between getting some more of those fees in \\nversus what's happening on the loan  demand side. Thanks.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nSure. Good question, Ken. So I think in terms of Investment Banking and Markets, yeah, slightly better than expected last mon th. What I would \\ntalk about green shoots especially in Capital Markets generally, still definitely some headwinds in M&A, lower announced activity, some \\nregulatory headwinds there, so we'll see. I think it's a little too early to call a trend there based on recent results, but we'll see. In terms of the \\nbroader econom y and loan growth expectations, generally, we do still expect reasonably robust Card loan growth. But away from that for a \\nvariety of different reasons and different products, whether it be mortgage or C&I after revolver normalization, and especial ly if we  see a little \\nbit of a cooling off of the economy, I would expect loan demand to be relatively modest there, so we're not really expecting meaningful growth \\naway from Card.  \\n \\nBut of course, we're there for the right deals, right products, right terms. We lend through the cycle, so I see that as more of a demand -driven \\nnarrative which will be a function of the economy rather than any tightening on our side.  \\n..................................................................................................... .............................................................................................................................  \\nKen Usdin  \\nAnalyst, Jefferies LLC  Q \\nThat makes sense. And as a follow -up to that, on the Consumer side you mentioned that consumer s continue to spend albeit a little more \\nslowly, and you mentioned that consumers are also using their excess deposits a little bit more as well. Can you just elabora te a little bit more \\non just your feeling about the state of the consumer? And is that Car d growth continue to be driven by people needing to revolve as opposed \\nto wanting to have more in their deposits? Just kind of want the trade -off on that side too?  \\n............................................................................................ ............................................................................................................................. .........  \\n \\n \\n8 \\n \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. I mean, to us I think we still see this as a normalization, not deterioration story when we talk about consumer credit. Actually, revolve \\nper account has still not gotten to pre -pandemic levels actually, so I would definitely say that it's a wanting rather than needing at least for our \\nportfolio at t his point. And, yeah, I think the consumer continues to surprise on the upside here.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nKen Usdin  \\nAnalyst, Jefferies LLC Q \\nGot it. Okay. Thank you.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ................................................................................................... .. \\n \\nOperator:  Next, we'll go to the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ............................. ........................................................................  \\nGerard Cassidy  \\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC  Q \\nGood morning, Jeremy. Good morning, Jamie. Jeremy, can you give us your view on how you're measuring the treasury functions a nd the \\nasset liability of your balance sheet as we go forward versus the way you guys were positioning and managing it a year ago in  view of the fact \\nthat it looks like maybe we're approaching the terminal rate on Fed funds rates?  \\n............................ ............................................................................................................................. .........................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & C o. A \\nYeah. Gerard, I would say honestly not much changed there actually. We have been pretty consistently concerned about the risk  of higher \\nrates. Of course, we always try to position things to produce reasonable outcomes across a broad range of scenario s. But at the margin, we've \\nbeen biased towards higher rates, and that may be a little less true at these levels than it was before, although a lot of th at is just the \\nconsequence of deposit convexity playing out in the modeling. But in any case, all else equal, I think we are going to continue to focus on \\nmaking sure we're fine in a higher rate scenario while staying balanced across a range of scenarios. So not really a lot of c hange in our \\npositioning, and that's obviously including the fact that we took on First Republic which, even net of some of the liabilities, had a long structural \\ninterest rate position. We did not actually want to get longer as part of the deal, and so as a result we took actions to ens ure that net -net we \\nare still about the same as  we were last quarter.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nGerard  Cassidy  \\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC  Q \\nVery good. And then as a follow -up, you mentioned in giving us the read -through on the Commercial Banking segment of the business that \\nyou had some reserve building tied to some office real estate and also some downgrades in the Middle Market area. Can you go a little \\ndeeper? What are you guys seeing in this area, both Commercial Real Estate but also the C&I loans? What's happening in that s egment as \\nwell?  \\n.................................................... ............................................................................................................................. .................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. So I would caution you from drawing too broad a conclusion from this. I mean, I think that when we talk about office for example, our \\nportfolio as you know is quite small and our exposure to sort of so -called urban dense office is even smaller. The vast majorit y of our overall \\nportfolio is multi -family lending so as a result, like our sample size of observed valuations on office properties is quite small. But you know we \\nlike to be sort of ahead of the cycle, and based on everything that we saw this quarter it j ust felt reasonable to build a little bit there to get to \\nwhat felt like a comfortable coverage ratio. In the Middle Market segment, we saw downgrades in excess of upgrades, but I don 't see that as \\nsort of necessarily indicative of anything terribly signif icant in the broader read -across.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ................................................................................................. .... \\nGerard Cassidy  \\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC  Q \\nThank you . \\n............................................................................................................................. ................................................................ .....................................  \\n \\n \\n9 \\n \\nOperator:  Next, we'll go to the line of Steve Chubak from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nSteve, you there?  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................   \\n \\nOperator:  It looks like his  line dropped so next we'll go to the line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. You may proceed.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ............................ .........................................................................  \\nEbrahim H. Poonawala  \\nAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Q \\nGood morning. I guess just first question, following up on the outlook for the economy. Like, we've all been worried about the recession for a \\nyear and there's a debate about the lagged effects of the Fed rate hike cycle. When you think about – Jeremy, I think you mentioned your \\nunemployment outlook relatively similar today versus a quarter ago – how worried shou ld we be in terms of the credit cycle 6 to 12 months \\nfrom now? Or are you leaning towards concluding that maybe U.S. businesses, consumers have absorbed the rate cycle a lot bett er than we \\nexpected a year ago?  \\n.............................................. ............................................................................................................................. .......................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. So, I  mean, I'm sure Jamie has some views here. But in my view, I would just caution against jumping to too many super -positive \\nconclusions based on a couple of recent prints. And I think generally, our point is less about trying to predict a particular  outcome  and more \\nabout trying to make sure that we don't get too much euphoria that over -concentrates people on one particular prediction when we know that \\nthere's a range of outcomes out there. So obviously, people are talking a lot about the potential for soft -landing right now, no landing, \\nimmaculate disinflation or whatever. And whether our own views on that have changed meaningfully, I don't know. But the broad er point is that \\nwe continue to be quite focused on Jamie's prior comment that loss rates still have  room to normalize even post -pandemic, so we're probably \\nover-earning on credit a little bit.  \\n \\nObviously, we've talked about the expectation that the NII is going to come down quite a bit. So even forgetting about whethe r you get some \\nsurprisingly negative  outcomes on the economy from where we stand today, even in a central case you just need to recognize that there \\nshould be some significant normalization.  \\n..................................................................................................... .............................................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. And I would just add that the 5.8% is not our predic tion. That is the average of the unemployment under multiple scenarios that we have \\nto use which are hypothetical for CECL. So you have this prediction that's going to always look something different and we do n't know the \\noutcome. We try to be really clear  here – the consumer is in good shape, they're spending down their excess cash – that's all tailwinds. Even if \\nwe go to a recession, they're going with rather good conditions, low borrowings and good house price values still. But the he adwinds are \\nsubstant ial and somewhat unprecedented. There's war in Ukraine, oil and gas, quantitative tightening, unprecedented fiscal needs of \\ngovernments, QT which we never experienced before. I just think people should take a deep breath on that. We don't know if th ose thi ngs \\ncould put us in a soft landing, a mild recession or a hard recession. And obviously, we all hope for the best.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nEbrahim H. Poonawala  \\nAnalyst,  Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Q \\nGot it. And just a follow -up on the upcoming Basel reforms, two questions. You've talked about the impact to the U.S. economy, like others \\nhave said the same. At this point, is that falling on deaf ears? And secondly, maybe, Jeremy, if you can touch upon just structural changes that \\nyou expect to make in the Capital Markets business because of FRTB. Thank you.  \\n..................................................................................................... .............................................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. So on your first point, I mean, I think you can just read Vic e Chair Barr's speech, right?  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\n10 \\n \\nEbrahim H. Poonawala  \\nAnalyst,  Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Q \\nYeah . \\n............................................................................................................................. ........................................................................................... ..........  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nHe addressed that point fairly directly. He clearly doesn't agree as is his right, so we'll see what happens. We continue to feel that, all else \\nequal, higher capital requirements de finitely are going to increase the cost of credit, which is bad for the economy, so we'll see what happens \\non that. On FRTB, it's really very nuanced. It's probably too much detail for this call, to be honest. But just to give you l ike one immaterial and \\ninsignificant but useful example, one product under FRTB is yield curve spread options. And if the FRTB proposal goes through as currently \\nwritten, that product just becomes not viable. So, obviously, if we need to stop doing that product, no one really car es. But it's just one \\nexample of the way sometimes, when you're really disciplined about allocating capital thoroughly all the way down to individu al products and \\nresponding accordingly, you can wind up having to change your business mix.  \\n \\nThere are obviou sly more significant products that matter much more for the real economy like mortgage where the layering -on of the \\noperational risk and the way it's being proposed, especially if some of the other beneficial elements of the proposal don't c ome through, yo u're \\nonce again making that product even harder to offer to homeowners. So we'll see, we'll see what happens.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nI would just add to that. Even if your product doesn't make money, you might do it for clients who are great clients. You're going to manage by \\nproduct, by client, and by effectively business mix, and those need a djustments. Roughly, loans don't make sense to put on your balance \\nsheet as a whole, almost any loan, and people have to recognize that. And so we just manage through all the various complicat ions here and \\nfigure out what the hell to do.  \\n.................. ............................................................................................................................. ...................................................................................  \\nEbrahim H. Poonawala  \\nAnalyst, Bank of America M errill Lynch  Q \\nOkay. Thank you.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\nOperator:  Next, we'll go to the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ............................................................... ......................................  \\nMike Mayo  \\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC  Q \\nHi. I had another question on Vice Chair Barr's speech from this week. To the extent that capital ratios do go up 20% for you  and perhaps \\nothers, to what degree would you think about changing your business model in terms of remixing where you do business, repricing or simply \\nremoving activities that you used to do? It's kind of ironic, or maybe it's not ironic, that Apollo hits an all -time stock price high at the same week \\nof the speech. So how much business leaves JPMorgan or the industry if capital ratios do go up as much as potentially propose d? \\n...................................................................................................................... ............................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. Mike, I mean...  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nWait. Before Jeremy answers the question, this is great news for hedge funds, private equity, private credit, Apollo, Blackst one – and they’re \\ndancing in the streets.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\n11 \\n \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah, exactly. And I was going to say, Mike, yes to everything, so meaning repricing, yes, definitely. To the extent that we have pricing power \\nand the higher capital requirements mean that we're not generating the right r eturns for shareholders, we will try to reprice and we'll see how \\nthat sticks and how that flows into the economy and how that affects demand for products. And if the repricing is not success ful, then in some \\ncases we will have to remix and that means gett ing out of certain products and services. And as Jamie points out, that probably means that \\nthose products and services leave the regulated perimeter and go elsewhere, and that's fine. As Jamie points out, those peopl e are clients \\nand I think that point wa s addressed also in Vice Chair Barr's speech. But traditionally, having risky activities leave the regulated perimeter has \\nhad some negative consequences, so these are all important things to consider.  \\n...................................................... ............................................................................................................................. ...............................................  \\nMike Mayo  \\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC  Q \\nAlright, and separate question. I appreciate the Investor Day – gives a little bit more color on the degree that your investments may or may not \\npan out; we are still all watching that closely. Having said that, you just increased revenue guidance by $10 billion for NII  between  this quarter \\nand the first quarter without changing expense guidance by even $1. Aren't you tempted to spend a little bit more? Why not sp end more if \\nyou're gaining share? And I'm not saying that you should; I'm just wondering like aren't you tempted to d o so? You have $10 billion more \\nrevenues and you're not spending $1 more of expenses. Like, why not?   \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nMike, let me get this right. You're actually complaining that our expenses aren't high enough? Is that right?  \\n................................................................................................................ ..................................................................................................................  \\nMike Mayo  \\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC  Q \\nWait, wait. Just to be clear. It's just the flip side of the question I asked for two years,  going back to it.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nFair enough. I appreciate the balance. In all seriousness, we've always been pretty clear, right, that our spending is throug h-the-cycle \\nspending based on through -the-cycle investment, through -the-cycle spending based on our through -the-cycle view of the earnings -generating \\npower of the company and the goal to produce the right returns. So broadly speaking, NII tends to flow straight through to th e bottom line, both \\nwhen it's  going up and, by the way, when it's going down too, and we've been through those moments as you well remember. So whether or \\nnot there are opportunities to deploy some more dollars into marketing and stuff like that, we have actually looked at that r ecent ly. I don't see \\nthat being a meaningful item this year, which is part of why we have not revised the expense guidance so far.  \\n \\nBut this is about investing through the cycle and being honest and disciplined about which revenue items carry expense loadin g and which of \\nthem don't.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nMike M ayo \\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC  Q \\nAnd then last quick follow -up... \\n............................................................................................................................. ....................................................... ..............................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nMike, I think we're kind of running as fast as we can. So if you actually sat down directly with credit compliance, auto mark et, bankers, \\nrecruiters, traders – Mike, this is it. We're full effort right now and we want to make sure we get things right and get things thoughtful and \\ncareful. So it's not just the money, it's the people and how many things you can change all at once and add to all at once.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\n12 \\n \\nMike Mayo  \\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC  Q \\nAnd then one quick follow -up to that. Your efficiency ratio this quarter is the lowest we've seen in a long, long time and I guess you're saying \\ndon't extrapolate this efficiency ratio because NII will come down at s ome point. But when you just simply look at – you benchmark yourself \\nagainst the low -cost providers, where do you think you're there now and where can you still go because if you extrapolate this quarter, you'r e \\ngetting closer?  \\n............................ ............................................................................................................................. .........................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & C o. A \\nYeah. I mean, you said it yourself, right? You definitely can extrapolate the current numbers. But I think more broadly on be nchmarking \\nourselves to low -cost providers, it sort of speaks to an area that you've been interested in for a long time which  is all of the investment that \\nwe're doing in technology to improve generally scalability and get more of our cost base to be variable versus fixed in terms  of how we \\nrespond to volumes – that's a big part of the reason that we're doing the investments tha t we're doing, and modernization and cloud and AI \\nand all the type of stuff that we've talked about a lot. So I think we feel really good about our efficiency as a company, bu t there definitely is \\nroom for improvement.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nMike Mayo  \\nAnalyst, Wells Farg o Securities LLC  Q \\nAlright. Thank you.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\nOperator:  Next, we'll go to the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. You may proceed.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ................................................................... .................................  \\nSteven Chubak  \\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research LLC  Q \\nHey. Thanks for taking the question and apologies for the technical issues earlier. Wanted to ask on the deposit outlook – just with signs that \\nrecent liquidity drawdown has come predominantly out of RRP versus industry deposits, just wanted to get your thoughts on what expectations \\nyou have for deposit growth in the second half, both for you and even the broader industry, especially as Treasury issuance r eally begins to \\nramp in earnest.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. Good question, Steve, so let me say a couple things about this. So obviously, our deposit numbers have bounced around a  little bit as a \\nfunction of some of the turmoil that we saw in regional banks as wel l as obviously the First Republic transaction. But now, if you look at our \\nkind of end -of-period deposits this quarter and you project forward, our core view is that we would expect a sort of modest downward trend t o \\nre-assert itself from this higher start ing point, broadly as a function of QT playing through the system but noting that we do have some hope for \\noffsets by taking share. Just to give a couple examples, like in Consumer, we've got some of our branch expansion markets sea soning and so \\nthere are share opportunities there. And in Wholesale, we’ve obviously invested a lot in products and services and so we think we have \\ncompelling offerings that are helping us win mandates, and so there are potentially some share offsets there. But broadly, ou r core  view \\nremains modest deposit declines across the franchise.  \\n \\nWithin that, you note the same thing we've noted that as we got through the debt ceiling and the TGA build has come into effe ct, and you've \\nseen a lot of bill issuance, big question in the market  about whether that was going to come out of reserves or come out of RRP. And so far, \\nwith most of the TGA build – I guess they're targeting $600 billion and they're at $550 billion – or something so they're almost done, more of it \\nthan some people feared has come out of RRP. So as you say, I think that's a relatively good sign and highlights how the system works better \\nwhen you've got ample supply of short -dated collateral on the front end of the yield curve. So that whole RRP/TGA bank reserve dynamic is \\ngoing to continue to be significant, but it is good to see RRP coming down a little bit.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ........................................... ..........................................................  \\nSteven Chubak  \\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research LLC  Q \\nHelpful color, and just a follow -up on Card income. Revenues were muted in the quarter. I was hoping you could unpack just the sources of \\npressure. Maybe more specifically, how much of a drag is associated with FAS 91 versus some other factors.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ........................ .............................................................................  \\n \\n13 \\n \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. So actually, that Card income number, Steve, is a little bit of a one -off thing. So we had a reward liability  adjustment this quarter, kind of \\na technical thing, so that's just a temporary headwind. And also, the sequential comparison is also getting hurt by a small p ositive one -off item \\nin the prior period. And obviously, I know you guys looked at it, but Card i ncome isn't sort of a thing we look at that much ourselves.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ....................................................................... ..............................  \\nSteven Chubak  \\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research LLC  Q \\nCan you size the reward liability impact?  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nWhy don't you get Mikael to give that to you? It's not that significant but it's enough to just make the sequential number lo ok a little bit wonky.  \\n.......................................................................... ............................................................................................................................. ...........................  \\nSteven Chubak  \\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research LLC  Q \\nGreat . Thanks for taking my questions.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................   \\n \\nOperator:  Next, we'll go to the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. You may proceed.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ................................................................... ..................................  \\nGlenn Schorr  \\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI  Q \\nThank you. Just want to follow -up on this pricing power conversation because you've been consistent over time that you have a limited ability \\nto sustain pricing power due to the competitive landscape. But I guess my question is if not now, when? Meaning, a lot has changed on the \\ninstitutional side, the European bank side, the regional bank side and I would think that there’d be certain businesses that you have a greater \\nability an d willingness to push price on. And then maybe you could tie that to your comments in the press release on what are the mater ial – \\nwhat are the real -world consequences for markets and end users that you're referring to when talking about material regulator y changes? \\nThanks a lot.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJere my Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nSure. So, look, on pricing power, you're right – it really depends on the product and it depends on the competitive landscape across different \\nbanks, and so it's very granular, it's very product -specific and in some cases we'll have more pricing power than in other cases. I think the \\noverall point that we're trying to make in connection with Basel III Endgame is just that like we think the capital increases  are excessive and it \\nputs pressure on retu rns all else equal, that obviously puts pressure on us to increase price where we can. That is generally a bad thing for the \\nreal economy and how all that plays out in detail across different products and services remains to be seen, importantly sinc e we d on't actually \\nhave the proposal yet – so we need those details. And sorry, Glenn I forgot the second half of your question. What was it?  \\n....................................................................................................................... ...........................................................................................................  \\nGlenn Schorr  \\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI  Q \\nActually, I think you hit on it so I'll just do a follow -up on a related. So the notion of private credit doing large traditional investment -grade \\nlending activity is maybe part of the competitive landscape that limits the ability to push price. In Jamie's letter, you tal ked about the downside \\n– or my question is what's the downside if more of the mortg age credit asset -backed intermediation business is pushed out of the banking \\nsystem?  \\n............................................................................................................................. .............................................. .......................................................  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n14 \\n \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A  \\nI mean, I guess it depends on what you mean by downside. But I just think societally speaking, I think we've seen in recent history that when \\nhome lending is happening outside the regulated perimeter and things get bad, when you have economic downturns, it produces b ad \\noutcomes for individuals and homeowners and society as a whole, and Jamie has written about this extensively. Beyond that, financially, \\nwe've talked about how mortgage lending – I mean, the profitability swings obviously is reasonably cyclical and the recent past has actually \\nbeen very profitable, then it was less so. Like, the correspondent channel right now is a ctually picking up a little bit. But it's a thin -margin \\nbusiness, it's challenging. And when you increase the capital requirements, it makes it even harder so that just becomes one of the areas \\nwhere you're in that tension between remixing versus pricing p ower that we talked about a second ago.  \\n \\nAnd it might, in fact, mean that we do less – less credit available for homeowners and more regulatory risk as the activity moves outside the \\nperimeter.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nGlenn Schorr  \\nAnalyst, Evercor e ISI  Q \\nAppreciate that, Jeremy.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\nOperator:  Next, we'll go to the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nBetsy L. Graseck  \\nAnalyst, Mor gan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nHi. Good morning.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ........................................................................................ .............  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nHi, Betsy.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nBetsy L. Graseck  \\nAnalyst, Mor gan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nI just wanted to unpack a little bit more the drivers of the change you outlined that's coming in the 10 -Q, Jeremy, regarding the asset sensitivity \\ngoing from liability -sensitive to asset -sensitive, at least that's the way I read i t. I just wanted to understand what the drivers of that is.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ....................................................................... ..............................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah, sure. No problem, Betsy. I mean, as you know, that's always been a challenging number. It's meant as a risk management measure of \\nsorts, although it's also somewhat limited in that respect, and it has been of uneven usefulness in terms of a tool to be able to predict our NII \\ntrajectory when rates change. But as we've looked at that and try to improve it and spoken to all of you through this latest rate h iking cycle, \\nwe've come to the conclusion that it would improve the usefulness of the disclosure if we included in the modeling the effect  of deposit \\nrepricing lags. And so, we've done that and that just has the effect that I talked about – it increases th e EaR number about $4 billion from \\nminus $1.5 billion, which is roughly what it was last quarter and what it would've been this quarter without the change to so mething more like \\n$2.5 billion.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nBetsy L. Graseck  \\nAnalyst, Mor gan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nSo then…  \\n............................................................................................................................. ................................................................................................. .... \\n \\n \\n \\n15 \\n \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nAll the usual caveats apply, right? I mean, it's never – the answer is going to always – for any given change in rates, the change in our NII is \\nalways going to be for one reason or another different from what that disclosure shows. But we do our best to make it easy.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ............................................ .........................................................  \\nBetsy L. Graseck  \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nOkay. And so, is it fair for me to think about that change as a mark -to-market to where we are today? And when I think about your forward \\nguide here, longer -term you're saying, look, deposit betas are accelerating. So as I go through the 10 -Qs over the next four, five quarters, I \\nshould expect that that $2.5 billion should come down because deposit betas you're anticipating are going to be acceler ating from here? I'm \\njust trying to put those two things together.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah, it's a good question. It's quite a technical issue. So I think in the past, the way this number was constructed was to assume through -the-\\ncycle betas on all the deposits, and so your notion that like the number would  include deposit beta acceleration would not have been the case \\nbecause it would've been using essentially terminal deposit betas based on the forward curve and then based on a 100% shock t o the forward \\ncurve. The nuance that we've introduced now is to rec ognize that given the shock, the reprice that the beta predicts will not be instantaneous, \\nand so you get sort of just the mathematical consequences of that. But I think translating that into a statement about our ex pectation for beta \\nfor the next 12 month s relative to our NII guide might be a bridge too far. I'm not sure you can actually draw that conclusion.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nBetsy L. Graseck  \\nAnalyst, Mor gan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nRight. But you were saying earlier deposit betas you do anticipate are going to be accelerating from here, and that's part of  the outlook for NII \\nlonger -term to normalize in the mid -70s. Is that right?  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYes, but let me emphasize something on that. Go ahead, Jamie.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. I mean, basically, yes. If you have – if the next round is going to be the beta will be 30 to 40 to 50 bps, I mean, whatever the product is, \\nyeah, that's the lag. And the $2.5 billion will go down over time as that actually happens – if rates actually go up. If rates don't actually go up, \\nthat $2.5 billion may be exactly $2.5 billion again.  \\n........................................................................................................................ ..........................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nBetsy L. Graseck  \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nGot it.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ...................................................................................... ...............  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n16 \\n \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah, exactly. And what I was going to say, Betsy, is just that the projection of the $87 billion coming down to a significan tly lower number \\ncontains both the element of internal migration as well as the potential, which is by no means guaranteed, of product -level reprice. And \\nfurthermore then, obviously the dynamics are a little bit different in the different business segments as you move from large  corporate \\nWholesale to  Consumer.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nBetsy L. Graseck  \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nOkay. All right. Thank you. Appreciate it.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah . \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\nOperator:  Next, we'll go to the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ................................................................. ...................................  \\nMatt O'Connor  \\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.  Q \\nGood morning. So I'm in your camp that eventually consumers will want more deposit rate sensitivity here. But I guess what wo uld make you \\nchange your rates meaning fully? So the top two banks have about 50% consumer market share, loan -to-deposit ratios are low. Your outlook \\nfor loan growth, and I think others, is fairly sluggish, at least outside of Card. I get that it's common sense, and that's w hat we've seen \\nhisto rically. But there really is this kind of big divergence among big banks and everybody else where the big banks just don't ne ed to pay that \\nmuch for deposits for a slew of reasons. So what would make you change that?  \\n....................................... ............................................................................................................................. ..............................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. In the end, Matt, it's just feedback from the field. It's competition and feedback from the field. We – Jamie, go ahead.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nI think every bank is in a different position about what they need, and so you have a whole range of outcomes. But remember, we do this also \\nby city, so you have different competition in Arizona – in Phoenix – than you have in Chicago, Illinois. And when you do have high interest rate \\nproducts, so it's a combination of all those things. I w ouldn't call it big bank versus small bank, and you're going to see when everyone reports \\nwho kind of paid up a little more for things and who didn't and things like that. So, look, guys, I would take it as a given.  I think it's a mistake. \\nThere is very li ttle pricing power in most of our business and betas are going to go up. Take it as a given. There is no circumstance that we 've \\never seen in the history of banking where rates didn't get to a certain point that you had to have competing products. And ra tes go up through \\nmigration or direct rates or movement to CDs or money market funds. We're going to have to compete for that – you already see it in parts of \\nour business, and not in other parts.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nMatt O'Connor  \\nAnalyst, Deutsc he Bank Securities, Inc.  Q \\nYeah. I 100%...  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. Matt, it's really just about primary bank relationships in the end. That's the core of the strategy.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\n17 \\n \\nMatt O'Connor  \\nAnalyst, Deutsc he Bank Securities, Inc.  Q \\nYeah. I mean, again, I 100% agree, but we've never seen kind of loans -to-deposit ratios for banks like yours this low, so you could just let \\ndeposits run off at a modest amount for quite some time and make the decision not to pay up. I mean, I've seen the trade -off that eventually \\nyou'll...  \\n............................................................................................................................. ................................................................. ....................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nBut that's a little more complicated because a lot of that loan -to-value ratio is lower because of regulatory stuff, LCR, capital ratio, etcetera.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nMatt O'Connor  \\nAnaly st, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.  Q \\nGot it. Okay. All right. Thank you.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ......................................................... ............................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nThanks . \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\nOperator:  And for our final question, we'll go to Charles Peabody from Portales Partners. You may proceed.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nCharles W. Peabody  \\nAnalyst, P ortales Partners LLC  Q \\nMorning. Jeremy, on page 4 of your presentation, you show some liquidity metrics. And there's been a meaningful deterioration , or I shouldn't \\nsay deterioration, depletion of some of that excess liquidity, obviously for First Republi c primarily. So my question is how quickly do you want \\nto rebuild that liquidity because as I look out towards 2024, there's probably a half dozen variables that are going to make liquidity a premium \\nevent – to have excess liquidity? So that's my first que stion. What's your plans for replenishing that liquidity?  \\n............................................................................................................................. ......................................................................... ............................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. Charlie, so I know we talked about this a little bit at Investor Day, right? So as I said in my prepared remarks, yeah,  we think about half \\nof the change in t he bank LCR number is a consequence of First Republic and the rest of it is just the expected decrease in system -wide \\ndeposits flowing through into our HQLA balances and the bank LCR ratio. So that's all entirely as expected and therefore, I t hink that the  \\nreplenishing notion is not correct. In fact, obviously, we still have ample, ample liquidity. Now, if you want to project tre nds forward, that's a \\ndifferent story but that's sort of the business of banking. We'll adjust accordingly in terms of our asset a nd liability mix across different products \\nand to ensure compliance to the ratios and fortress balance sheet principles as you would expect from us.  \\n........................................................................................................... .......................................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nAnd I would just add to that – just look at the top of the page in the press release, $1.4 trillion of cash and marketable securities. Even if we get \\ndown to no excess, we're going to have like, I forgot the exact number, $1.2 trillion. I think we have excess liquidity, and the liquidity ratio is \\nslightly somethin g different. I think there's plenty of liquidity in the system and, of course, we do multiple things to change this overnight  if we \\nwanted to.  \\n................................................................................................................. .................................................................................................................  \\nCharles W. Peabody  \\nAnalyst, Portales Partners LLC  Q \\nAll right. So sort of wrapped into that as a follow -up, if you take your $87 billion forecast for NII this year, and that implies at least one quarter \\nof maybe $22 billion of NII, and you take your eventual forecast of mid -$70 billion of NII at some point in the future, that would imply at least \\none quarter of $18 billion of NII so  that's about an 18% drop. And if you hold the balance sheet steady, you're talking about a 30 -basis point  \\n \\n18 \\n \\nCharles W. Peabody  \\nAnalyst, Portales Partners LLC  Q \\ndrop in your margin, your NIM, to get from $22 billion to $18 billion. I mean, what is driving – is it really the deposit or are you thinking in term s \\nof interest reversals as credit deteriorates or is it rebuilding of liquidity? I'm just trying to get a better sense of the i mpact is.  \\n....................................................................................................................... ...........................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. Hey, Charlie. I would think about that as being really entirely a deposit story. It's just not that complicated, right? I think we did this – I \\nthink it was either in the fourth quarter or in the first quarter – where we put a little chart on a page, just very simple terms, that shows what the \\ndollar consequences are of whatever – like 10 -basis point change in deposit rate paid in terms of NII run rate. So whether it's as a \\nconsequence of migration from lower -yielding to higher -yielding, going from 0% to a 4% CD is obviously a big impact on margin. Or whether \\nit's because  savings reprices, relatively small changes in rate there are kind of a lot of money when you've got a couple trillion dollars  of \\ndeposits. So it's really not any more complicated than that and that's why we're being so forceful about reminding people abo ut what we \\nexpect that trajectory to be.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ........................................................................................... ..........  \\nCharles W.

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. This call is being \\nrecorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by.  \\n \\nAt this time I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum, and their Chairma n and CEO, \\nJamie Dimon. Mr. Dimon, please go ahead . \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJamie  Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  \\nGood morning, everybody. Before we start the actual call, I want to repeat something we just said on the press call, so before  we get into the \\ndiscussions about third quarter earnings, I just w ant to say how deeply saddened we all are about the recent horrific attacks on Israel and the \\nresulting bloodshed and more. Terrorism and hatred have no place in our civilized world and all the hearts at JPMorgan Chase go out to all \\nwho are suffering.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  \\nThanks, Jamie. And of course, I very much echo the sentiment. Now let's turn to our third quarter earnings results. The prese ntation is \\navailable on our website and please refer to the disclaimer in  the back.  \\n \\nStarting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $13.2 billion, EPS of $4.33 on revenue of $40.7 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 22%. \\nThese results included $669 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate and $665 million of Firmwide legal expense. On page 2, \\nwe have some more detail.  \\n \\nSimilar to last quarter, we have called out the impact of First Republic where relevant. For this quarter, First Republic con tributed $2.2 billion of \\nrevenue, $858 million of expense and $1.1 bi llion of net income. Now, focusing on the Firmwide results, excluding First Republic, revenue of \\n$38.5 billion was up $5 billion, or 15% year -on-year.  \\n \\nNII ex. Markets was up $4.8 billion, or 28%, driven by higher rates and higher revolving balances in Car d, partially offset by lower deposit \\nbalances. NIR ex. Markets was up $374 million, or 4%, which included lower net investment securities losses than the prior ye ar. And Markets \\nrevenue was down $190 million, or 3% year -on-year.  \\n \\nExpenses of $20.9 billion were up $1.7 billion, or 9%, year -on-year, primarily driven by ongoing growth in front office and technology staffing \\nas well as wage inflation and higher legal expense. And credit costs were $1.4 billion, predominantly driven by net charge -offs in Card an d \\nincluded a $102 million net reserve release, driven by changes in the central scenario, primarily offset by Card loan growth.  \\n \\nOn to balance sheet and capital on page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 14.3%, up about 50 basis points versus t he prior \\nquarter, as the benefit of net income less capital distributions was partially offset by AOCI. We had $2 billion of net share  repurchases this \\nquarter, and the pace of buybacks will likely remain modest in light of the Basel III Endgame proposal. In  line with our capital hierarchy, we will \\ncontinue to reassess the buyback trajectory as circumstances evolve or opportunities emerge.  \\n \\nAnd on the topic of the Basel III endgame, you'll see that we added a couple of pages on it, so let's cover that now sta rting on page 4. Given \\nthe significance of this proposal for us, the broader industry, as well as households and businesses as end -users, we thought it was important \\nto spend time discussing it. And while we know there's interest in having us quantify the expected impact of this proposal in a lot of granular \\ndetail, it's important to start by asking why the proposed increase is so large given the repeated statement over time by pol icymakers that \\nbanks are well -capitalized and well -positioned to deal with st ress.  \\n \\nGiven that context, the absence of detailed analysis supporting a capital increase of this magnitude is disconcerting and the re's a lot that does \\nnot make sense to us. Starting with RWA, we've already said we expect the firm's RWA to increase by aro und 30% or $500 billion, which \\nresults in capital requirements increasing by about 25% or $50 billion.  \\n \\nOne immediate thing to point out is that at 4.5% GSIB, a $500 billion increase in RWA requires $22.5 billion of additional ca pital with no \\nchange in our  systemic risk footprint. We've been on the record for a long time. The GSIB was conceptually flawed and mis -calibrated \\noriginally; since implementation, the failure to address economic growth, despite the Fed themselves acknowledging this probl em at the o utset \\nhas made matters worse. And now, all of those problems are being applied to an additional $500 billion of RWA.  \\n \\n3 \\n \\nOur view is that the combined proposals could have adjusted the surcharge levels to keep dollars of capital associated with G SIB buffer \\nconstant rather than simply multiplying the RWA increase by the existing surcharges. Another lense on the proposed increases is the \\nintroduction of RWA for operational risk and its clear overlap with op risk losses already capitalized through the Stress Cap ital Buffer. Although \\nthere's limited disclosure from the Fed on this point, we have estimated that we have about $15 billion of operational risk c apital embedded in \\nthe SCB based on the information the Fed does disclose. Once we capitalize with this new op risk RWA, our required capital will go up by \\naround $30 billion without any change to our portfolio.  \\n \\nNow, let's turn to page 5 which shows the impact of the actual and proposed capital rules over the last few years. Zooming ou t from the details \\nof this mo st recent proposal, this page reminds us of what's happened since 2017. Since then, SA -CCR and the Stress Capital Buffer have \\nbeen adopted, and our GSIB surcharge will increase to 4.5%. So assuming the Basel III Endgame and GSIB proposals are finalize d in their \\ncurrent form, we would see a 45% increase in our capital requirements relative to that 2017 starting point. This illustrates again how over \\ncalibrated these proposals are, and it's not done yet. We still expect the Fed to incorporate CECL into CCAR, which will likely increase the \\nSCB. And of course, given the absence of a fix to the GSIB flaws it continues to present a headwind into the indefinite futur e. And aside from \\nthose dynamics, there remains the longstanding issue of procyclicality in the over all capital framework.  \\n \\nWe think it's also important to point out that the agencies did actually have a choice here. While it may technically be true  that the proposal is \\nBasel compliant, Basel compliance does not mandate a 25% increase in capital requirements. Implementing the Basel III Endgame \\nconsistently with how the Europeans have, by retaining credit risk modeling and also addressing the compounding effects of GS IB and SCB, \\nwould have achieved Basel compliance without creating this unnecessary  increase in capital requirements.  \\n \\nAs you would expect, we will continue to engage and forcefully advocate during the comment period and beyond, in a great deal  of technical \\ndetail. For the purposes of this call, we wanted to make the equally important br oader points about both the level of capital increase and the \\nflaws in the construct of the framework itself, since coherent design is critical to the framework's durability over time. Th e current proposal \\nexacerbates existing features that discourage bene ficial scale and diversification. If it goes through as written, there will likely be significant \\nimpacts on pricing and availability of credit for businesses and consumers.  \\n \\nIn addition, the ongoing and persistent increase in the regulatory cost of market  making for banks suggests that the regulators want dramatic \\nchanges of the current operation of the U.S. capital markets. We believe that well -regulated market makers that are committed to deploying \\ncapital to clients on a principal basis are a critical b uilding block supporting the breadth, depth and resilience of the American capital markets, \\nwhich is vital to the U.S. economy. So, caution is warranted when proposing changes of this magnitude.  \\n \\nWith that, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 6. Consumer spend growth has now reverted to pre -pandemic trends, with \\nnominal spend per customer stable and relatively flat year -on-year. Cash buffers continued to normalize to pre -pandemic levels, with lower \\nincome groups normalizing faster.  \\n \\nTurnin g now to the financial results, excluding First Republic. CCB reported net income of $5.3 billion on revenue of $17 billion w hich was up \\n19% year -on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 30% year -on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates . End -of-period \\ndeposits were down 3% quarter -on-quarter. We ranked number one in Retail deposit share based on FDIC data and continued to solidify our \\nleadership position in key markets. Client investment assets were up 21% year -on-year, driven by market performance and strong net inflows \\nas we continue to capture yield -seeking flows from our Consumer Banking customers.  \\n \\nIn Home Lending, revenue was down 2% year -on-year, given a smaller market. Originations of $10.3 billion were up slightly quarter -on-\\nquarter, but they remain down 15% year -on-year.  \\n \\nMoving to Card Services & Auto – revenue was up 7% year -on-year, driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially \\noffset by lower auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 16% year -on-year, due to strong account acquisition and continued \\nnormalization of revolve. And in Auto, originations were up $10.2 billion, up 36% year -on-year, as we saw competitors pull back and we gained \\nmarket share.  \\n \\nExpenses of $8.5 billion were up 7% year -on-year, largely driven by continued investments in staffing, primarily in front office and technology. \\nIn terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.4 billion, driven by net charge -offs, which were up $720 million year -on-year, \\npredomina ntly due to continued normalization of Card. The net reserve build of $49 million reflected a $301 million build in Card Serv ices, \\nprimarily offset by a $250 million release in Home Lending.  \\n \\nNext, the CIB on page 7. CIB reported net income of $3.1 billion , on revenue of $11.7 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $1.6 billion was \\ndown 6% year -on-year. IB fees were down 3% year -on-year, and we ranked number one with a year -to-date wallet share of 8.6%. In Advisory, \\nfees were down 10%. Underwriting fees wer e up 8% for debt and down 6% for equity.  \\n \\nIn terms of the outlook, we're encouraged by the level of capital markets activity in September, and we have a healthy pipeli ne going into the \\nfourth quarter. Advisory has also picked up compared to the first half,  but year -to-date announced M&A remains down significantly, which will  \\n \\n4 \\n \\ncontinue to be a headwind. Payments revenue was $2.1 billion, up 3% year -on-year. Excluding equity investments, it was up 12% driven by \\nhigher rates, partially offset by lower deposit b alances.  \\n \\nMoving to Markets – total revenue was $6.6 billion, down 3% year -on-year, against a very strong third quarter last year. Fixed Income was up \\n1%, driven by an increase in financing and trading activity in Securitized Products, as well as improved performance in Credit. This was \\npredominantly offset by Currencies and Emerging Markets coming off a very strong quarter last year. Equity Markets was down 1 0%, \\nreflecting lower revenues across products compared to a strong prior -year quarter, as activity was challenged by lower volatility. Securities \\nServices revenue of $1.2 billion was up 9% year -on-year, driven by higher rates partially offset by lower deposit balances. Expenses of $7.4 \\nbillion were up 11% year -on-year, predominantly driven by higher leg al expense and wage inflation.  \\n \\nCredit costs were net benefit of $185 million, driven by a net reserve release of $230 million reflecting the impact of net l ending activity and net \\ncharge -offs of $45 million.  \\n \\nMoving to the Commercial Bank on page 8. Comme rcial Banking reported net income of $1.7 billion. Revenue of $3.7 billion was up 20% \\nyear-on-year, with Payments revenue of $2 billion, up 30% year -on-year, driven by higher rates. And Gross Investment Banking and Markets \\nrevenue of $821 million was up 8%  year-on-year, reflecting increased M&A volume.  \\n \\nExpenses of $1.4 billion were up 15% year -on-year, largely driven by an increase in headcount, including front office and technology \\ninvestments, as well as higher volume -related expense, including the impac t of new client acquisition. Average deposits were down 7% year -\\non-year, 5% quarter -on-quarter, primarily driven by lower non -operating deposits as clients opt for higher yielding alternatives.  \\n \\nLoans were up 1% quarter -on-quarter. C&I loans were flat, reflecting continued stabilization in new loan demand and revolver utilization. And \\nCRE loans were up 1%, reflecting funding of prior year originations in Real Estate Banking, as well as lower payoff activity.  \\n \\nFinally, credit costs were $64 million,  including net charge -offs of $50 million and a net reserve build of $14 million.  \\n \\nThen to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 9. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.1 billion, with pr e-tax margin \\nof 31%. Revenue of $4.6 billion was  relatively flat year -on-year, as higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market \\nlevels were offset by lower performance fees and lower NII from deposits. Expenses of $3.1 billion were up 3% year -on-year, driven by \\ncontinued growth in our private banking advisor teams and the impact of closing the J.P. Morgan Asset Management China and Global Shares \\nacquisitions.  \\n \\nFor the quarter, net long -term inflows were $20 billion, positive across all asset classes led by Equities. And in liquid ity, we saw net inflows of \\n$40 billion. AUM of $3.2 trillion was up 22% year -on-year and client assets of $4.6 trillion were up 21% year -on-year, driven by continued net \\ninflows of higher market levels. Finally, loans were flat quarter -on-quarter, while de posits were down 5%, driven by migration to investments, \\npartially offset by client inflows.  \\n \\nTurning to Corporate on page 10. Corporate reported net income of $911 million, revenue was $1.5 billion, up $1.8 billion com pared to last \\nyear. NII was $2 billio n, up $1.2 billion year -on-year, due to the impact of higher rates. And NIR was a net loss of $506 million and included the \\nnet investment securities losses I mentioned upfront. Expenses of $456 million were up $151 million year -on-year.  \\n \\nTo finish, we hav e the outlook on page 11. We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex. Markets to be approximately $88.5 billion and $89 billion, \\nrespectively, with the increase driven by slower reprice than previously assumed. Consistent with what we've been saying thro ughout the year, \\nwhile we don't know when it will normalize, we do not consider this level of NII to be sustainable.  \\n \\nOur outlook for 2023 adjusted expense is now approximately $84 billion. And as a reminder, this is on an adjusted basis, whic h excludes legal \\nexpense . Also, remember this outlook excludes the pending FDIC special assessment.  \\n \\nAnd on credit, we now expect the 2023 Card net charge -off rate to be approximately 2.5%, mostly driven by denominator effects due to recent \\nbalance growth.  \\n \\nSo to wrap up, we're p leased with another quarter of strong operating results. Throughout the year we've been pointing out the various \\nsources of significant uncertainty in all of those, including the geopolitical situation, economic outlook, rate environment,  deposit reprice a nd \\nthe impact of the Basel III Endgame proposal are as prominent now as they have been in the recent past. But as always, we con tinue to \\nprepare for a range of scenarios and are focused on being there for our clients and customers when they need us most.  \\n \\nAnd with that, let's open the line for Q&A.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\n \\n \\n \\n5 \\n \\nQUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION  \\n  \\nOperator : Thank you. Please stand by. Our first question comes from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. You may proceed.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJohn McDonald  \\nAnalyst, Autonomous Research  Q \\nHi, good morning. Jeremy, I was wondering if you could give us a little more color in what you're seeing so far on deposit re price and \\nmigration. What's been better than expected so far on that front? And how do you see higher -for-longer rates potentially impacting deposit \\nreprice pressure?  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nSure. Thanks, John. I think the themes are pretty much the same as we've seen in prior quarters. So, as we talked a little bi t about on the \\npress call, we've been trying to be a little bit cautious about recognizing that we don't think the current levels are sustainable and we do think \\nthat we'll have to reprice in some pockets to some degree, maybe tiering or whatever at some point in the future. A nd, of course, that hasn't \\nhappened yet this year, so that's one factor.  \\n \\nIn the meantime, the CD strategy is working well. We're getting – continue to get very good feedback from the field and we're capturing money \\nin motion, and so we're seeing the sort of internal migration and the associated slow increase in deposit rate paid as a result of CD migration. \\nBut that’s sort of working as we would have hoped and so everything is kind of playing out according to plan, I would say.  \\n \\nIn terms of higher -for-longer, I think it just means that there will continue to be upward pressure on deposit pricing both from internal migration \\nand possibly moderate effects. And in the end, as we always say, we’re going to price products as a function of the competiti ve market \\nenvironment.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJohn McDonald  \\nAnalyst, Autonomous Research  Q \\nAnd just as a follow up, it seems like you’ve done some securities repositioning the last couple quarters. How are you positi oning the balance \\nsheet in terms of cash and the securities portfolio, given your outlook for rates?  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. I think I would say that while we're not predicting higher rates, I don't know if Jamie will have something to say here , we believe in being \\nprepared for it and that's been our position for some time and, of course, that's produced good results. And we continue to try to position \\nourselves so that neither have significantly higher rates nor significant lower rates present a particularly large chal lenge to the company. So \\nprobably at the margin, we're still a little bit biased for slightly higher rates. But, do keep in mind that when modeling th e duration of the \\nbalance sheet, higher rates do extend the duration or rather shorten the duration on the  deposit side, so that can be a factor as well.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJohn McDonald  \\nAnalyst, Autonomous Research  Q \\nOkay, thanks.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\n \\nOperator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nSteven Chubak  \\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research LLC  Q \\nHey, good morning . \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\n \\n6 \\n \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nHey, Steve.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nSteven Chubak  \\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research LLC  Q \\nHi. Jeremy, I was hoping to just inquire about the capital markets outlook. You cited improved activity levels in September. But given \\npersistently higher rates, geopolitical tensions, and just poor performance of recent IPOs, how are you thinking about the ou tlook over the near \\nto medium term? And how are you thinking about just the timing  of an inflection activity?  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. Good question. I mean, as you know obviously, the current levels in investment banking remain quite depressed; certainly relative to the \\nelevated levels we saw during the pandemic, but eve n relative to sort of 2019, which is what you might consider the last normal year. We do \\neventually think we'll recover to those levels and hopefully recover to above those levels, recognizing by the time it happen s you will have  \\nhad many years of economi c growth in the meantime. And to be fair, while the current environment is a little bit complicated and mixed and \\nthere are some headwinds as you pointed out, things have improved a little bit. And I think I would say our banking team is a  little bit more \\noptimistic than they were last quarter. So it feels to me like a little bit of a slow grind with some positive momentum but o bviously significant \\nuncertainty in the outlook and some structural headwinds given lower levels of announced M&A and some regulato ry headwinds on that side.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nSteven Chubak  \\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research LLC  Q \\nThanks for the color. Just for my follow up, on some of the regulatory commentary you provided. Certainly, a lot of helpful c olor in the slides, \\nso thank you for that. If the proposal were to go through as written, what proportion of the inflation do you believe can be mitigated over time? \\nAnd was also hoping you could provide some context as to the quantum of how you think CECL inclusion could potentially impact  the SCB \\nand CCAR.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Finan cial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. Those are all good questions, Steve. I think it's probably too early to try to provide that level of quantification on either front. If I start first \\nwith the Basel III Endgame proposal, from our perspective, we' re currently focused on advocating as aggressively as possible for the \\nnecessary changes. Some of which are what  you might call philosophical in nature or some of the things I highlighted in my prepared remarks, \\nbut some of them are sort of very technical in nature, including things that we think might actually be mistakes in the proposal. And so talking a \\nlot about optimizing away stuff that might change just feels like a bit premature at this point.  \\n \\nI would point out that given how significant operational risk RWA is as part of the proposal, that is, you can think of that sort of as a generic tax \\nacross the entire spectrum and is therefore in some sense non -optimizable. So, we feel that it's important to manage expectations about the \\nlevel of op timization that's possible, once the rule is finalized and hopefully some of the technical items are addressed.  \\n \\nAlso, it depends on your definition of optimization. Sometimes I use the term costless optimization, whereas these technical fixes that don’t \\naffect revenue and don’t require you to exit businesses; I think that type of optimization will be harder to find than it has been in the past. But \\nas we pointed out, we may simply need to exit things. And that will be because it is better than the alternat ive, which would be to do activity \\nthat’s shareholder value destructive but it won’t be costless.  \\n \\nA good example of that is the renewable energy tax credit investment business, which as a result of the quadrupling of the ri sk weight, may no \\nlonger make se nse. Now, that's one that we hope will be changed but it's tricky because those are very long duration assets. So between now  \\nand the rule is finalized, it raises some questions about whether we want to put that stuff on the balance sheet. So, sorry a  bit of a long answer \\nbut then, yeah, on quantifying CECL and CCAR, I think we better wait for that one. Cause given the relative lack of transpare ncy that we have \\ninto the Fed's exact modeling, in terms of which quarter is the peak and so on and so forth, it's  a little bit hard to predict what the exact impact  \\nof putting CECL and CCAR is going to be. We just know probabilistically that it will, like everything else these days, tend t o push capital \\nhigher.  \\n....................................................... ............................................................................................................................. ..............................................  \\n \\n7 \\n \\nSteven Chubak  \\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research LLC  Q \\nVery helpful color, Jeremy. Thanks for taking my question.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\n \\nOperator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. You may proceed.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................   \\nEbrahim H. Poonawala  \\nAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Q  \\nHey. Good morning. Just first question, Jeremy, on credit. I think you mentioned some of the reserves release was tied to the  change in the \\ncentral scenario. So just talk to us and remind us what the cen tral scenario is today, what changed? And then in terms of fundamentally on \\ncredit, like where are you seeing softness either on the Consumer or the Commercial side?  \\n.......................................................................................... ............................................................................................................................. ...........  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. So on the central scenario, you should read the research that gets put out by our competitors and our excellent research team. No, but \\nin all seriousness, I think our U.S. economists had their central case outlook to include a very mild recession with I think two quarters of \\nnegative half a percent of G DP growth in the fourth quarter and first quarter of this year, and that then got revised out early this quarter to now \\nhave sort of modest growth I think around 1% for a few quarters into 2024. So, just flowing that through our process while ac knowledging  that \\nwe're still skewed to the downside, we're still reserved to a significantly higher unemployment rate on a weighted -average basis than is in the \\ncentral case outlook. So that number we've sometimes given you is 5.5% this quarter. So, it's really not m uch more complicated than that. \\nWe're just kind of following the process.  \\n \\nAnd I think your other question was where am I seeing softness in credit? And I think the answer to that is actually nowhere,  roughly. We're \\ncertainly nowhere that's not expected, m eaning, we continue to see the normalization story play out in Consumer more or less exactly as \\nexpected, and then of course, we are seeing a trickle of charge -offs coming through the office space. You see that in the charge -off number of \\nthe Commercial Ba nk, but the numbers are very small and more or less just the realization of the allowance that we've already built there.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ......... ............................................................................................  \\nEbrahim H. Poonawala  \\nAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Q \\nThat's helpful. And just going back to the details you laid out on Basel Endgame, maybe on the philo sophical side I think Jamie was speaking \\nlast month, said that we don't expect any changes but at the same time, you make everything that makes sense in terms of the pushback. Is it \\nall falling on deaf ears from a shareholder perspective? Are we resigned t o the fact that we are going to see more towards the worst -case \\noutcome play out or is there some level of sort of meeting in the middle of the road as this thing gets finalized?  \\n............................................................................. ............................................................................................................................. .......................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. So I'll let Jamie speak for himself on that point, but our job is to advocate. We're not going to guess what the sentim ent is in \\nWashington. It's a thousand -page rule proposal, as you know. We've got the big team of very smart people studying it very  closely. \\nInterestingly, we noted recently that in some of the analysis that they did about the impact on lending, they sort of forgot about like – the Fed, \\nin their preamble, they forgot about a $1 billion (sic) [trillion] of  operational risk RWA. So it j ust highlights that there is the possibility, or seemed \\nto have forgotten, they simply omitted the impact of the operational risk RWA on fees.  \\n \\nSo anyway, the point is it's long, it’s complicated, it’s technical. We do think there are probably some technical mistakes in there. We're not \\ngoing to forcefully advocate on all of those. And while we disagree with a lot of this stuff, these are technical issues that  should be, in some \\nsense, resolved technically, and hopefully they'll listen.  \\n............. ............................................................................................................................. ........................................................................................  \\n \\n8 \\n \\nEbrahim H.

Our next question comes from Ryan Kenny with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nRyan Kenny  \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nHey. Good morning.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJamie  Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief  Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nHey. \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nHi. \\n............................................................................................................................. .................................................................................... .................  \\nRyan Kenny  \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nWant to dig in on the NII side. So you raised the 2023 NII ex. Markets guidance by $2 billion for this year. So I know your c omments in the \\npress release suggest JPMorgan's over earning. So I just want to triangulate there. What does normalized NII look like? And do we get to \\nnormalized next year or later on?  \\n............................................................................................................................. .......... ...........................................................................................  \\n \\n9 \\n \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A  \\nYeah, a couple things. So, let me do the timing question first. So we're being very clear that we are not predicting when. When is going to be a \\nfunction of the marketplace and the rate environment and competitive dynamics and so on and so forth. So we're just really ju st trying to \\nremind everyone to not bank on the current run rates, which we just don 't fundamentally think are sustainable.  \\n \\nYou'll be aware that before Investor Day earlier this year, we tried to quantify what we thought that kind of normalized rang e might look like, \\nand we put a sort of mid -70s type number out there. And at Investor Day , we talked about how the acquisition of First Republic was going to \\npush that number up a little bit, although there was some overlap and so on and so forth. So anyway, with the benefit of time  and having \\neverything settled in a little bit, if you sort of  push us for that, kind of, what is that number now look like, we think it’s probably closer to about  \\n$80 billion, with all of the obvious caveats that this is a guess, and we don’t know when. But we’re just trying to point out  that it’s quite a bit  \\nlower  than the current run rate.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nRyan Kenny  \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nGot it.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJamie  Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief  Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nInside the company, some people think it'll happen sooner, i.e. me. Some people think it'll happen later, i.e., Jenn and Mari anne and Jeremy.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nI wasn't aware that I was in that camp, actually.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ...................................... ...............................................................  \\nJamie  Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nOh, ok.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nBut I don't know, I'm not trying to have an opinion over you.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ................................... ..................................................................  \\n \\nOperator:  Thank you.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ................................... ..................................................................  \\nRyan Kenny  \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nAnd then on the loan growth side, industry loan growth has slowed significantly this year. What demand are you seeing for loa n growth across \\nthe different categories? And I know it might be too early to talk about next year, but directionally, how should we think ab out loan growth \\ngiven where we are in the cycle and the higher capital requirements coming?  \\n................................ ............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah, sure. So on loan growth, the story is pretty consistent with what we've been saying all year. So we've, of course, seen  very robust loan \\ngrowth in Card, and that's coming from both spending growth and the normalization in revolving balances. As we look forward, we're still \\noptimistic about that, but it'll probably be a little bit more muted than it has been during this normalization period.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n10 \\n \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nIn Auto, we've also seen pretty robust loan growth recently, both as a function of sort of slightly more competitive pricing on our side as the \\nindustry was a little bit slow to raise rates. And so we lost some share previously, and that's come back now. And generally,  the supply chain \\nsituatio n is better, so that's been supported. As we look forward there, it should be a little bit more muted.  \\n \\nAnd I think generally in Wholesale the loan growth story is going to be driven just by the economic environment. So depending  on what you \\nbelieve about soft landing, mild recession, no landing, you have slightly lower or slightly higher loan growth. But in any case, I would ex pect it \\nto be relatively muted. And, of course, Home Lending remains fairly constrained both by rates and market conditions. But al so, and I think this \\nis true across the board, we will be managing things actively, as mentioned in light of Basel III, which may not change origi nations, but it will \\nchange what we retain.  \\n.................................................................. ............................................................................................................................. ...................................  \\nRyan Kenny  \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nThank you.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\nOperator:  Thank you. Our nex t question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. You may proceed.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ................................................................... ..................................  \\nGerard Cassidy  \\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC  Q \\nGood morning, Jeremy. How are you?  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nHey, Gerard.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ........................................................................... ..........................   \\nGerard Cassidy  \\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC  Q \\nJeremy, you guys have put up a really strong ROTCE number of 22% for the quarter. And when you dive into your different segme nts, what \\nreally jumps out at us is the 40% ex -First Republic ROE in Consumer & Community Banking. I know you and Jamie have talked about your \\nover-earning on credit. We get that. But in view of all of these fintechs and all of these other nonbank competitors that we're al l supposed to \\npick away at everybod y's market share, you guys have put up great numbers here. What's the drivers behind an ROE? Even when you take \\nthat credit over -earning out, what's driving this business' profitability at such high levels?  \\n................................................. ............................................................................................................................. ....................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah, Gerard. So I'd say a couple things there. So first, it's not just credit. It's also deposit margin, right? So when we talk ab out over -earning \\non NII, a disproportionate amount of that is coming out of the Consumer franchise for all of the reasons that we'v e talked about. But, I would \\nalso point out sometimes we don't like the word over -earning because right now, customers are happy and they're doing CDs.  \\n \\nAnd the broader answer to your question about why we're able to be effectively really comes back to a d ecade, two decade long history of \\ninvesting for the future and recognizing that there's a holistic value proposition here that includes branches, and the app, and all of the online \\nservices, and the entire suite of products and services that is around this  enterprise which drives engagement and customer loyalty. And we're \\nseeing some of the benefits of that now, although we're not complacent. The competition is still there. The fintechs are stil l there, and we know \\nwe need to continue investing to preserve the value. And it's also true that the particular circumstances of the current rate and credit \\nenvironment mean that the earnings are a little bit above normal, but that core franchise is extremely robust.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\n \\n \\n11 \\n \\nGerard Cassidy  \\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC  Q \\nVery good. And then as a follow up, which ties into your answer on the deposit margin and consumer and your earlier comments you and \\nJamie about the internal debate inside JPMorgan about the migration of rates going higher on the funding side. Your non -interest -bearing \\ndeposits I think are around 28% of total deposits which is slightly above the 26% you guys had back in 2018 or 2019 or pre -pandemic. Is this \\nexpectation that you're going to see more of the non -interest -bearing depos its go into interest -bearing? Or, is it just the repricing of interest -\\nbearing deposits that have some of your folks inside JPMorgan a little more cautious on that net interest income number?  \\n................................................................ ............................................................................................................................. .....................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. It's a good question, Ge rard. I think it's a little bit bigger picture than that. And I'm not sure – I get your questions, a good question, but \\nI'm not sure that the reported interest -bearing, non -interest -bearing split is the best lens to look at this through for a couple of rea sons. So first, \\nlike between Wholesale and Retail, we've got some amount of non -interest -bearing and Wholesale that's part of the ECR product, so you see \\nsome dynamics there that play out. And in Consumer, in a world where savings is paying a relatively lo w-rate paid to cross -checking and \\nsavings, the migration dynamics are probably not that different right now.  \\n \\nBut then of course, even within Consumer across both consumers and small businesses, you've got slightly different dynamics i n terms of how \\npeople  manage their operating balances. So I would tend to zoom out a little bit and see this as a holistic answer, that's driven by  internal \\nmigration from checking, savings to CDs, from ECR to interest -bearing and Wholesale and then our potential response to t he rate \\nenvironment, the competitive environment, the overall level of system -wide deposits in terms of product level reprice that may or may not \\nhappen in moments in the future.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nGerard Cassidy  \\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC  Q \\nGreat. Thank you . \\n............................................................................................................................. ............................................................................. ........................  \\n \\nOperator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. You may proceed.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nErika Najarian  \\nAnalyst, UBS S ecurities LLC  Q \\nHi. Good morning. Jeremy, my first question is for you, again sort of maybe re -asking the question in a different way. Your new guide for net \\ninterest income for this year would imply an exit run rate of $22.9 billion in the fourth quarter . As we think about the dynamics in higher -for-\\nlonger, on one hand, your fixed rate assets will continue to reprice. On the other, you even asked a lot about the deposit dy namics that could \\ncontinue to creep higher. How do we think about those puts and tak es as we think about that relative to that exit rate of $22.9 billion in the \\nfourth quarter?  \\n............................................................................................................................. ...................................... ...............................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. So, Erika, I think the simple answer to your question is I believe that fourth quarter exit number equates to a $90 billion run rate ex. \\nMarkets and we're kind of saying...  \\n............................................................................................................................. .......................................................................... ...........................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\n$22.5 billion.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financi al Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. Isn't that what I meant to say?  \\n............................................................................................................................. ......................................................... ............................................  \\n \\n12 \\n \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nShe said $22.9 billion.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nOh, I didn't hear that, okay. Anyway...  \\n............................................................................................................................. ......................................................... ............................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nWe didn’t model it that way.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nSo call it $90 billion run rate on an exit rate basis, and we're saying that we think something a bit more normal is closer t o $80 billion, so that's \\none building block.  \\n \\nUnderneath that, I think one thing that's interesti ng actually, is that as the percentage of the deposits which are CDs increases, the sort of \\nbalance between internal migration and betas and rate and volume, it's a little bit less binary and a little bit smoother, so  when we look at this \\ntype of stuff and  we model migration, balances, product level reprice, as you get out of that lower zero bound with 0% CD mix world, things get  \\na little bit smoother, I would say, overall.  \\n \\nSo it'll be interesting to watch that, but it's obviously one of the most important  things for us as a company right now and we do everything we \\ncan to manage it, but it's also worth remembering that the big picture point is just the client franchise and as we've often said, we're very \\nfocused on primary bank relationships and we didn't lose any of those in the last cycle, and we're not planning to lose any in this cycle, and \\nthat's what sort of a long -term focus means for us.  \\n................................................................................................................. .................................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nAnd I would just add quantitative tightening in there. That will be a large number, and we don't exactly know the effect, where wholesale, \\nconsumer as – remember also the Fed has the R RP program which is also sucking money into the Fed directly and reducing deposits. That's \\nstill a trillion too.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nErika Najarian  \\nAnalyst, UBS S ecurities LLC  Q  \\nThank you. And my second question is on maybe zooming out on the Basel III Endgame impacts. It's clearly complex, overly comp lex, and I \\ncompletely agree with you that it is unnecessary at this point and very backward looking. I guess, what is not complex is the fact that you \\ngenerated 75 basis points of CET1 this quarter while your RWAs are down. And I guess my question here is, is that I understan d that we're in \\nthe public advocacy process.  \\n \\nI hear you loud and clear in terms of  how this could have harm in terms of pricing for Main Street and dislocating the pipes in American capital \\nmarkets. But for JPMorgan, does this change your natural return profile of 17%? Jamie, I know you lingered a little bit on 14 % when you were \\nat Barc lays in September. But at the end of the day, it feels like for the portfolio managers that own JPMorgan through the cycle, d oes Basel III \\nEndgame really harm your natural earnings power and returns?  \\n........................................................ ............................................................................................................................. .............................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. Okay. That's a good question, Erika. I think there's a couple pieces in there, so let me take the most important piece first, which  is the \\n17% through the cycle target. Are we keeping that or not in light of the Basel III Endgame proposal? So, short answer is we 're not going to \\nchange that number today, but when you look at what we've disclosed about a 25% increase in capital, you have to start by ack nowledging \\nthat that is a major headwind to returns.  \\n \\n13 \\n \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nIn simple terms, you talk about earnings power and returns, but they're two different things, right. We have to be a little bit pedantic and do \\nnumerator and denominator here. Okay, so say the numerator doesn't change. If you just dilute down the numerator by the incre ased capital, \\nthat's a significantly lower retu rn number.  \\n \\nI would say that that's probably the lower bound in terms of the impact of the Basel III Endgame for a couple reasons. One is , we are hoping \\nfor changes. Two is, once the rule is final, we will seek to reprice in the places where we can. And th at'll be different in Consumer and \\nWholesale, some of it will be product level, some of it will be relationship level, but that hopefully can mitigate some of i t but of course the flip \\nside of that is that's cost getting passed into the real economy and th at's part of the point that we've made about lowering availability of \\nproducts and services and lending. There may be some opportunities for costless optimization. I'm personally a little bit mor e pessimistic about \\nthose, but we've surprised ourselves on t hose points in the past, so we'll see.  \\n \\nAnd then finally, yeah, we may stop doing certain things and we may exit things. But, I wouldn't necessarily assume that that 's going to do a lot \\nto preserve returns at the 17%. That's going to be about exiting thing s that are shareholder -destructive, but not necessarily producing much \\nhigher returns, if you know what I mean.  \\n \\nSo that's that, and then the other part of your question implicitly was talking about organic capital generation and I think it's just very imp ortant \\nto separate impacts on the economy and impacts on long -term returns from our ability to meet the requirements. Of course, as Jamie always \\nsays, JPMorgan is going to be fine and we're building a lot of capital and we were managing capital conservativ ely and we'll be able to build \\nthe necessary capital in order to achieve on -time or early compliance, which is always what we strive to do, but that doesn't really have any \\nparticular bearing on the question of what the long -term return target is or the im pacts on the real economy.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nErika Najarian  \\nAnalyst, UBS Securities LLC  Q \\nGot it. Thank you.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\nOperator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. You may proceed . \\n............................................................................................................................. ......................................................... ...........................................  \\nGlenn Schorr  \\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI  Q \\nHi. Thank you. So I very much appreciate the comments in the release on the big picture things, what's going on in the world and their \\npotential impact on markets, on food ma rkets, global trade, everything that you mentioned, and sadly agree about the most dangerous time in \\ndecades. The question I have is, does it surprise you that markets are hanging in, that you, yourself, have green shoots or s till green shoots \\ntype of mind set about banking while that's going on? And then maybe more importantly, if you believe what obviously what you wrote, what \\nare you doing about it? How do you manage yourself conservatively? How do you prepare for tougher times?  \\n.......................... ............................................................................................................................. ...........................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorga n Chase & Co.  A \\nGo ahead, Jeremy.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYou want to start? Okay. So, I mean, on green shoots, you'll just note that our comments are cautious. I mean, there is momen tum. I do think \\nwe are a little bit more optimistic than we were, but obviously, markets have bee n bumpy, both equity markets and rate markets have been \\nvery whippy recently. So we don't want to get too carried away with optimism here. We are coming in off a very low base and s o there's a \\nhope and an expectation that we are on the path to normalizatio n and improvement. And of course, the overall economic picture at least \\ncurrently looks solid, this sort of immaculate disinflation trade is actually happening. So those are all reasons to be a lit tle bit optimistic in the \\nnear-term, but it's tempered with quite a bit of caution.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ............................ .........................................................................  \\n \\n14 \\n \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nSo I would add a question. There has been an extraordinary amount of fiscal monetary stimulus still in the system, and you can't look at, and \\nof course, it can drive markets in sentiment and sales and profits and all that, but you can't stay like this forever. Betwee n QT, if you never had \\nand how much the fiscal stimulus could continue at this rate before you h ave kind of the crowding out kind of factor. So I think people have to \\nbe very cautious, and of course, the geopolitics I think is just an extraordinary issue we have to deal with. How do you prep are the company \\nfor that?  \\n \\nWe do 100 stress tests a week, an d we do multiple views of it, including geopolitical problems, interest rate problems, but usually, geopolitics \\npresents itself as a deep recession or a mild recession, or a recession part of the world, or markets going down a lot, and b ecause markets do \\nwell is not a reason, ever, to say that they are going to continue to do well.  \\n \\nIf you don't believe me, remember 1987, 1990, 1994, the year 2000, the year 2009, and people don't predict those inflection p oints. But my \\ncaution is that we are facing so many uncertainties out there. You just got to be very cautious with what you're facing. And like I said, the other \\nthing about the green shoots, regardless of that, we try to run the company so that we serve the clients day in and day out, better products and \\nbetter services, securely, safely, and all those things, so that's the ultimate goal.  \\n \\nWe know there are going to be bad times. That's not a surprise that there are going to be bad times. We don't always know how they're \\ncoming, and where they're coming fro m, but we'll keep on serving clients and doing good for clients, you can build a good business kind of \\nseparate from what it does to your returns. That's a slightly different issue at this point, but we'll deal with that too whe n we figure out what to \\ndo. \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nGlenn Schorr  \\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI  Q \\nThank you for all that, all good.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ................................................................................. ....................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A  \\nThanks, Glenn.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\nOperator:  Thank you. Our nex t question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ..................................................... ................................................  \\nMike Mayo  \\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC  Q \\nHi. I understand the NII strategy benefited from First Republic, asset sensitivity, CD strategy, money in motion, and I'm cur ious to how much is \\nthe NII increase and the deposit benefits a function of the 67 million digital banking customers? Do you have more digital banking cu stomers \\nthan branch customers now? If you can just refresh that.  \\n \\nAnd then a more general question. I guess I have the first one fo r Jeremy and the second one for Jamie. You have record tech spend. What's \\nthe benefit of having record tech spend, if you can kind of mark -to-market your thoughts there as it relates to AI, as it relates to maybe wasted \\nspending, your outlook for next year ? And does it really help to be the biggest tech spender in the banking industry?  \\n............................................................................................................................. ................................................. ....................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A  \\nYes. Let me do digital banking, Mike. I spent some time on this actually a couple weeks ago. And it's interesting to note thi s sort of extent to \\nwhich the growth in digitally engaged consumers is higher than the overall growth in consumer accounts, meaning that we're co ntinuing to \\nincrease the percentage of our consumers that are digitally engaged. And it sort of goes back to my prior poi nt... \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nBut the percent who are digital only is much lower than that . \\n \\n15 \\n \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nFor sure. For sure. Which actually links to the broader point that what – in terms of your question about how much is this helping the current \\nNII story, it goes to the larger point of it holistic through the cycl e, multichannel, fully engaged customer strategy which requires a lot of \\ninvestment in branches, obviously, but also in digital services of all sorts. So in many ways, you can see the current enviro nment as a little bit \\nof a payoff of that investment. But that's not like, therefore, we stop investing, obviously.  \\n \\nSo I guess that's part of the answer. And I guess your other question is the benefits of being the biggest tech spender. I ju st think like it's sort \\nof mandatory, right? I mean we're big and it's a  very technology -centric business , and the world is competitive, and everything is changing. \\nYounger generations have different expectations, and we have to be nimble, and we have to be on our front foot. And otherwise , we risk \\ngetting severely disrupted. So I don't know if Jamie wants to add anything.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ................................................................................... ..................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nJust the competition, when we look at it, it's Wells, who's coming back, which I'm happy for you guys. It's obviously Marcus,  it's Apple, it's \\nChime, it's Dave. Ther e are a lot of people coming up after these businesses in different ways, and there some have been quite successful. \\nIt's Stripe in payments. And so we want to be very good and very competitive. Some of that tech spending is things which are almost a sine \\nqua non, which is cybersecurity, data center resiliency, regulatory requirements, and things like that, which we simply are g oing to do and be \\nvery, very good at to protect the company.  \\n...................................................................... ............................................................................................................................. ...............................  \\nMike Mayo  \\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC  Q \\nAs it relates to AI specifically, which is the tal k of the town, I guess the consensus among people outside the banking industry is that banks will \\nnot win that battle, including JPMorgan. You won't control the front end. What are you doing with AI to make a difference now , or is this just \\nsimply a moon s hot? \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nOh, I don't agree with that statement. Banks have an extraordinary amount of proprietary data in addition to when you do like  a large language \\nmodel, that's public data, looking at everything on the internet or ev erything that's ever been published or something like that. But AI is an \\nextraordinarily good tool to use. We just put a woman who's running it at our table. So it's data analytics, AI, et cetera. A nd there are multiple \\ntypes of AI. So we use AI for risk, fraud, marketing, prospecting. And the management team's getting better and better at saying how can we \\nuse the data to do a better job to reduce errors, to serve clients better, to have a salesperson have co -pilots so they know to widen the client's \\ncoin or something like that. And so, we simply have to do it. Does it create opportunity for disruptors to come in? Yeah, of cours e. That's \\nalways been true with technology. And, but, we'll be quite good at it . \\n.................................................. ............................................................................................................................. ...................................................  \\nMike Mayo  \\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC  Q \\nAnd then lastly, I think you h ad made a mention at a conference about investment spend or tech spend over the next year. Where do you \\nstand on that?  \\n............................................................................................................................. ............ .........................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. Now because you did ask a little bit about the expense outlook for next year. So I think at the conference we said, I think the consensus \\nwas $88 billion, but we're still going through the budget process, et cetera, et cetera. So that's still true. I think we're still kind of in the ballpark, \\nbut I would say at the margin there's going to be a li ttle bit of upward pressure.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nIs that for First Republic too, or no?  \\n \\n16 \\n \\n............................................................................................................................. ................... ..................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah, this is all now including First Republic. And I think there will be a little bit of upward pressure on t hat as we sort of do our usual thing and \\nlook at all of the opportunities that we see and the investments that we want to make. So no surprise in that sense that we'r e going to invest \\nprudently. Nothing dramatic, but probably a little bit of upward pressur e at the margin.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nMike Mayo  \\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC  Q \\nAll right. Thank you.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nThank you.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ............................................................................. ........................  \\n \\nOperator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. You may proceed.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ....................................................................................................  \\nJim Mitchell  \\nAnalyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC  Q \\nHey. Good morning. Jeremy, do you think there's any receptivity among regulators regarding the double counting not only of op erational risk \\nbut I think you alluded to this earlier in the Markets business, but there's clearl y double counting in market risk in the trading book. Is there any \\nreceptivity?  \\n............................................................................................................................. ................................................... ..................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nCan I just answer that real quickly? We don't really know. It's a one -sided conversation generally. They say put it in your comments, so \\neveryone is going to put in extensive comments, kind of like you heard from Jeremy and we don't really know. We don't really know what's \\ngoing on inside the Fed, how many people get involved. In my view, it's become a very politicized process as opposed to the technical \\nanalysis I think is required to do it exactly right. So we'll see.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .................................... .................................................................  \\nJim Mitchell  \\nAnalyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC  Q \\nOkay. And then if it weren't to change, and you talked about the potential negative impact on liquidity in the Markets busine ss specifi cally, is \\nthat a JPM pulling out of certain businesses type event? Or is it more a comment that there'd be fewer providers of liquidity  as less scaled \\nplayers exit, and maybe that's almost equal a market share gain opportunity for JPMorgan in a smaller bus iness?  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nI think so if you look at Markets alone, it's a huge, I think 60%, increase in capital. And if you look at it, you can do tha t by product. For some \\nproducts it's worse than for others, but general ly it's bad across all products. But the really important thing is market making is a critical \\nfunction and if you look at the world, only some of these large market makers who could make markets for governments, hospita ls, cities, \\nschools, states, IMF, Wo rld Bank, BlackRock, Blackstone, and all those various things who buy and sell for their clients in size. And market \\nmakers have a different function than hedge funds, and I don't know what the real intent was with this. This is another one I  think that ne eds to \\nbe really thought through with what are you trying to accomplish.  \\n \\nWe do market making quite safe. We've never lost the kind of money that people talk about in market making in the global mark et shock or \\nsomething like that, but the other thing abou t market making, I do agree, it could actually force some people out. It will force lower positions \\nwhich is why I think it's a little risky, but it may also force more consolidation. And so clients, since they need it so muc h, there may be \\nconsolidation i n an unintended way in market making and obviously more volatile markets because with all the constraints, with the LCR, SLR,  \\ncapital, et cetera, you will constantly be up against limitations in what you can do.  \\n \\n17 \\n \\n............................................ ............................................................................................................................. .........................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. And I think that last point of Jamie's is particularly important because, sure, if you want, you can construct what I would c onsider a very \\noptimistic argument that the higher cost of doing business will lead smaller scale players to exit and that's a shar e gain opportunity for us, but \\nif I refer back to the comments about the disincentives to beneficial diversification and scale, getting bigger, especially i n markets is quite \\nexpensive from, for example, a GSIB perspective, and so you wind up kind of hemme d in on all sides which is one of the reasons why we're \\nsort of highlighting, but it does seem like the only way out, sometimes, when you look at the cumulative effect of everything  that's happened in \\nmarkets over the last 15 years, is a fundamentally very  different system, and while obviously...  \\n............................................................................................................................. ......................................................................................... ............  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nGreat opportunity for European market makers. I mean, a great opportunity, like they can do repo and FX and swaps and credit and stuff with \\n30% less capital. That is a big  difference in that kind of business.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ............................................................................................. ........  \\nJim Mitchell  \\nAnalyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC  Q \\nRight. That's helpful. Thanks.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\nOperator:  Thank you. Our last question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ..................................................... ................................................  \\nMatt O'Connor  \\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.  Q \\nHi, good morning. You talked about increased investment spend in some areas in response to an earlier question. But just how do you think \\nabout cost control overall, looking at the medium term? The outlook for revenue is obviously pressured at least on net interest inc ome. Fees \\nmight help, but the backdrop is for potentially declining revenue or at least flattish revenue for a couple or few years.  So, I know you always \\nsay you want to invest for the cycle, and it's really paid off over time, but how are you thinking about cost control the nex t few years?  \\n............................................................................................... ............................................................................................................................. ...... \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. I mean, I wish I had sort of an answer that fit better into your framework. But in some fundamental sense, we just kind of don't agree \\nwith the framework in the sense that and we've been through this over the last couple of years, right? In a world where rates  drop very \\nsuddenly and recover like quite dramatic ally, and credit becomes abnormally good and then rebounds, and you've seen these very significant \\nfluctuations in capital markets. We  saw that in 2021 going into 2022 where the revenue environment can change a lot in the short term for \\nreasons that can be  largely out of your control.  \\n \\nAnd while of course there are parts of our expense base, which are in the short term directly sensitive to the revenue enviro nment and some \\nof those adjust naturally and some of them we adjust more forcefully as a function of volumes, but other things are much more structural. And  \\nthe goal is to make sure that those other things are sized appropriately to what we believe sustainable through the cycle ret urns are. So we're \\nalways very focused on  cost. You can be rest assured of that. That discipline internally is as aggressive as ever as we go through the budget \\ncycle. But there are long -term plays and you really shouldn’t expect us to see trying to generate cosmetically lower costs in response t o a \\nlower revenue environment where we didn’t balloon the costs when the revenue became as we’ve argued unsustainably high.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nMatt O'Connor  \\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.  Q \\nYeah. Fair enough. And if I could just squeeze in on First Republic, obviously the contribution there is coming in multiples higher -than-\\nexpected. How do you think about the puts and takes in terms of, I think there's probably some run -off of loans still to come, but also \\nopportunities to deepen the relationships there?  \\n................. ............................................................................................................................. ....................................................................................  \\n \\n18 \\n \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorga n Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. So you're right about the contribution and about the run -off of loans, and it is notable the First Republic related net income that we've \\nprinted this quarter – so the first thing to say is that we don't think that that First Republic related net income number from this quarter is a \\nsustainable indicator of the future run rate. Some of the same dynamics that we've just talked about, in particular, over -earning on deposits or \\nsort of above normal on deposit margins, also apply t o the First Republic franchise to some degree. So we would expect that to normalize. \\nAnd probably more significantly as the things you alluded to, we do have some accelerated pull to par on some of the commitme nts that we \\ntook on at a fair value discount a s part of the acquisition, so that's a short -term tailwind in the revenue that will come out of that over the next \\nfew quarters.  \\n \\nAnd yeah, in terms of how it's going overall and deepening the relationships, that remains a focus and I think more of that w ill happen as we \\ncontinue the integration and we continue stabilizing. And yeah, I think as I said on the press call, things are going well ar guably a little bit \\nbetter than we'd sort of modeled as part of the acquisition, and we're happy to see that.  \\n.................................................................................................................................. ................................................................................................  \\nMatt O'Connor  \\nAnalyst, Deutsche Ba nk Securities, Inc.

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. This call is being \\nrecorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go to the live presentation. Please stand by.  \\n \\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Offic er, Jeremy \\nBarnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  \\nThank you and good morning everyone. The presentation is available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer in the b ack. Starting \\non page 1, the firm reported net income of $9.3 billion, EPS of $3.04 on revenue of $39.9 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 15%. These \\nresults included the $2.9 billion FDIC special assessment and $743 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate.  \\n \\nOn page 2, we have more on our fourth quarter results. Simi lar to prior quarters, we have called out the impact of First Republic where \\nrelevant. You'll also note that we have now allocated certain deposits, which were previously in CCB, to the appropriate line s of business. For \\nthe quarter, First Republic contrib uted $1.9 billion of revenue, $890 million of expense and $647 million of net income.  \\n \\nNow focusing on the Firmwide fourth quarter results excluding First Republic, revenue of $38.1 billion was up $2.5 billion or  7% year -on-year. \\nNII ex. Markets was up $2. 2 billion or 11%, predominantly driven by higher rates. NIR ex. Markets was up $139 million or 1%, and Markets \\nrevenue was up $141 million or 2%. Expenses of $23.6 billion were up $4.6 billion or 24% year -on-year, predominantly driven by the FDIC \\nspecial a ssessment and higher compensation, including wage inflation and growth in front office and technology.  \\n \\nAnd credit costs were $2.6 billion, reflecting net charge -offs of $2.2 billion and a net reserve build of $474 million. Net charge -offs were up $1.3 \\nbillion, predominantly driven by Card and single name exposures in Wholesale, which were largely previously reserved. The net re serve build \\nwas primarily driven by loan growth in Card and a deterioration in the outlook related to commercial real estate valuat ions in the Commercial \\nBank.  \\n \\nLooking at the full year results on page 3, the firm reported net income of $50 billion, EPS of $16.23 and revenue of $162 bi llion. And we \\ndelivered an ROTCE of 21%. On to balance sheet and capital on page 4. We ended the quar ter with a CET1 ratio of 15%, up 70 basis points \\nversus the prior quarter, primarily driven by net income, OCI gains and lower RWA, partially offset by a continued modest pac e of capital \\ndistributions as the firm builds towards the proposed Basel III Endga me requirements.  \\n \\nNow, let's go to our businesses starting with CCB on page 5. Total debit and credit card spend was up 7% year -on-year, driven by strong \\naccount growth, and consumer spend remained stable. Turning now to the financial results excluding Fir st Republic, CCB reported net income \\nof $4.4 billion on revenue of $17 billion, which was up 8% year -on-year.  \\n \\nIn Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 6% year -on-year, reflecting higher NII on higher rates, largely offset by lower deposits with \\naverage balances down 8% year -on-year. Client investment assets were up 25%, driven by market performance and strong net inflows – in \\nfact, it's been a record year for retail net new money. In Home Lending, revenue was up $230 million, predominantly driven by  the absence of \\nan MSR loss this quarter versus the prior year, and higher NII.  \\n \\nMoving to Card Services & Auto – revenue was up 8% year -on-year, driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially \\noffset by lower Auto lease income. C ard outstandings were up 14%, due to strong account acquisition and continued normalization of revolve. \\nAnd in Auto, originations were $9.9 billion, up 32% as we gained market share, while retaining strong margins.  \\n \\nExpenses of $8.7 billion were up 10% yea r-on-year, largely driven by compensation, including an increase in employees, primarily in bankers, \\nadvisors and technology, and wage inflation, as well as continued investments in marketing and technology. In terms of credit  performance \\nthis quarter, cre dit costs were $2.2 billion, largely driven by net charge -offs, which were up $791 million year -on-year, predominantly due to \\ncontinued normalization in Card. The net reserve build of $538 million reflected loan growth in Card.  \\n \\nNext, the CIB on page 6. Th e CIB reported net income of $2.5 billion on revenue of $11 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $1.6 billion was \\nup 13% year -on-year. IB fees were also up 13% year -on-year and we ended the year ranked number one with a wallet share of 8.8%. In \\nAdvisory,  fees were up 2%. Underwriting fees were up significantly compared to a weak prior -year quarter, with debt up 21% and equity up \\n30%.  \\n \\n \\n3 \\n \\nWe are starting the year with a healthy pipeline, and we are encouraged by the level of capital markets activity, but anno unced M&A remains a \\nheadwind, and the extent as well as the timing of capital markets normalization remains uncertain. Payments revenue was $2.3 billion, up 10% \\nyear-on-year. Excluding equity investments, it was flat as fee growth was predominantly offset by deposit -related client credits.  \\n \\nMoving to Markets, total revenue was $5.8 billion, up 2% year -on-year. Fixed Income was a record fourth quarter, up 8%. It was another \\nstrong quarter in our Securitized Products business, which was partially offset by lo wer revenue in Rates coming off a strong quarter last year. \\nEquity Markets was down 8%, driven by lower revenue in Derivatives and Cash. Securities Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 3% year -\\non-year. Expenses of $6.8 billion were up 4% year -on-year, p redominantly driven by the timing of revenue -related compensation. Credit costs \\nwere $210 million, reflecting net charge -offs of $121 million and a net reserve build of $89 million.  \\n \\nMoving to the Commercial Bank on page 7. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.5 billion. Revenue of $3.7 billion was up 7% year -\\non-year, largely driven by higher NII, where the impact of rates was partially offset by lower deposit balances. Payments revenu e of $2 billion, \\nwas up 2% year -on-year, driven by fee growth, la rgely offset by deposit -related client credits. Gross Investment Banking and Markets revenue \\nof $924 million, was up 32% year -on-year, primarily reflecting increased capital markets and M&A activity.  \\n \\nExpenses of $1.4 billion were up 9% year-on-year, driven by an increase in employees, including front office and technology investments, as \\nwell as higher volume -related expense, including the impact of new client acquisition. Average deposits were down 6% year -on-year, primarily \\ndriven by l ower non -operating deposits as clients continued to opt for higher yielding alternatives and flat quarter -on-quarter as client balances \\nare seasonally higher at year -end. \\n \\nLoans were down 1% quarter -on-quarter. C&I loans were down 2%, reflecting lower revo lver utilization and muted demand for new loans as \\nclients remain cautious. And CRE loans were flat, as higher rates continued to have an impact on originations and payoff acti vity. Finally, \\ncredit costs were $269 million, including net charge -offs of $127  million and a net reserve build of $142 million, driven by a deterioration in our \\ncommercial real estate valuation outlook.  \\n \\nAnd then, to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 8. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $925 million – with p re-tax \\nmargin of 28%. Revenue of $4.7 billion was up 2% year -on-year, driven by higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average \\nmarket levels, predominantly offset by lower NII. The decrease in NII reflects lower deposit margins and balance s, partially offset by wider \\nspreads on loans.  \\n \\nExpenses of $3.4 billion were up 11% year -on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, including performance -based incentives; \\ncontinued growth in our private banking advisor teams, the impact of closing J .P. Morgan Asset Management China acquisition and the \\ncontinued investment in Global Shares.  \\n \\nFor the quarter, net long -term inflows were $12 billion – positive across Equities and Fixed Income – and $140 billion for the full year. In \\nliquidity, we saw net  inflows of $49 billion for the quarter and net inflows of $242 billion for the full year. And we had record client asset net \\ninflows $489 billion for the year. AUM of $3.4 trillion and client assets of $5 trillion were both up 24% year -on-year, driven by continued net \\ninflows and higher market levels. And finally, loans were up 2% quarter -on-quarter and deposits were up 7% quarter -on-quarter.  \\n \\nTurning to Corporate on page 9. Corporate reported a net loss of $689 million. Revenue of $1.8 billion was up $597  million year -on-year. NII of \\n$2.5 billion, was up $1.2 billion year -on-year due to the impact of higher rates and balance sheet mix. NIR was a net loss of $687 million, \\ncompared with a net loss of $115 million and included the net investment securities lo sses I mentioned upfront. And expenses of $3.4 billion \\nwere up $3 billion year -on-year, predominantly driven by the FDIC special assessment.  \\n \\nWith that, let's pivot to the outlook for 2024, starting with NII on page 10. We expect 2024 NII ex. Markets to be  approximately $88 billion. \\nGoing through the drivers, the outlook assumes that rates follow the forward curve, which currently includes six cuts this ye ar. On deposits, we \\nexpect balances to be very modestly down from current levels. While lower rates sho uld decrease repricing pressure, we remain asset \\nsensitive, and therefore, lower rates will decrease NII, resulting in more normal deposit margins. We expect strong loan grow th in Card to \\ncontinue, but not at the same pace as 2023. Still, this should help offset some of the impact of lower rates. Outside of Card, loan growth will \\nlikely remain muted.  \\n \\nIt's important to note that we just reported a quarterly NII ex. Markets run rate of $94 billion. Combining that with the ful l year guidance of \\napproximately $88 billion implies meaningful sequential quarterly declines throughout 2024 consistent with what we've been telling you for \\nsome time. And keep in mind that many of the sources of uncertainty that we've highlighted previously surrounding the NII out look r emain. \\nAnd on total NII, we expect it to be approximately $90 billion for the full year, reflecting an increase in Markets NII which , as always, you \\nshould think of as largely offset in NIR.  \\n \\nNow, let's turn to expenses on page 11. We expect 2024 adjusted expense to be about $90 billion. You'll see on the slide, we provided detail \\nby line of business. Generally, you can see that both in dollar terms and in percentage terms, the expense growth is aligned to where the \\ngreatest opportunities are, both in terms  of share and available returns. And of course you'll hear more at Investor Day and between now and \\nthen.  \\n \\n4 \\n \\n \\nOn the right -hand side of the page, we've highlighted some Firmwide drivers. Thematically, the biggest driver is what I might call busines s \\ngrowth wr it large. Within that, narrowly defined volume and revenue -related growth represents about $1 billion of the increase across the \\ncompany as a result of an improved NIR outlook compared to about $400 million in 2023. But in addition, the ongoing growth of  the company, \\nwhich continues to produce share gains and additional profitability, is coming with increased expense across a range of categ ories.  \\n \\nThe quantum of investment increase is comparable to last year's increase and is driven by all the same themes, bankers, branches, advisors, \\ntechnology, as well as marketing. Net net, First Republic produces a modest increase in expenses, but with a significantly lo wer 2024 exit run \\nrate as the result of business integration efforts. Finally, despite significantly l ower inflation outlook and the economy as a whole, we still see \\nsome residual effects of inflation flowing through most of our expense categories.  \\n \\nIt's worth noting that both the general business growth and investment growth include decisions that have be en executed both in response to \\nmarket conditions during 2023 and to support the future growth and profitability of the company. We've included the fourth qu arter 2023 exit \\nrate on the page to illustrate that a significant portion of the year -on-year incre ase in expense is already in the run rate.  \\n \\nNow, let's turn to page 12 and cover credit and wrap up. On credit, we continue to expect the 2024 Card net charge -off rate to be below 3.5%, \\nconsistent with Investor Day guidance. So, in closing, we shouldn't le ave 2023 without noting what an outstanding year it was, producing \\nrecord revenue and net income despite some notable significant items. We're very proud of what we accomplished this year and want to thank \\neveryone who made it possible. At the same time, w e emphasized throughout 2023 the extent to which we were over -earning, as indicated by \\nan ROTCE that is 4% above our through -the-cycle target.  \\n \\nAs we turn to 2024, it shouldn't be surprising that our outlook has us beginning to march down the path towards normalization of our returns. \\nBut, despite the expected dissipation of the 2023 tailwinds and the presence of significant economic and geopolitical uncerta inties, we remain \\noptimistic about this franchise's ability to produce superior returns through a bro ad range of environments, and this management team \\nremains laser -focused on executing for shareholders, clients and communities.  \\n \\nAnd with that, let's open the line for Q&A.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\n \\nQUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION  \\n  \\nOperator : Please stand by. For our first question, it's coming from the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nMatt O’Connor  \\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.  Q \\nGood morning. Thanks for all the comments on the net interest income. Any updates on that medium term outlo ok that you've put out there ? \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. Matt, not particularly updating. I think you're referring to that $80 billion number that we'd put out there, and I wou ldn't exactly describe \\nthat as an outlook. I think it's more just a number that we put out there to try to quantify a little bit the extent of the over earning . So, not \\nparticularly necessary to revise the number. But I just would point out, again, as we highlight on the page, and as I hig hlighted in the prepared \\nremarks, that when you look at that $94 billion exit rate and full year guidance of $88 billion, that implies obviously exiti ng below $88 billion and \\nsome significant sequential decline. So, in that sense, you can see us kind of ma rching on the path to that $80 billion. Whether we ever get to \\nthe $80 billion or not and when is maybe a topic for later in the year or next year . \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nMatt O’Connor  \\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.  Q \\nOkay. And then just separately, you bought back couple of billion dollars of stock this quarter. What's your thought process on buybacks given \\nthe strong capital generation, but also some uncertainty on regulatory proposals ? \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n5 \\n \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. Good question. And I think you framed it exactly correctly in the sense that we obviously have a lot of buyback capacity in g eneral \\nbased on our organic capital generation. So, the normal capital hierarchy will apply. But for now, we plan to remain on a mo dest pace of \\nbuybacks consistent with that kind of $2 billion net buyback a quarter number that we've talked about and that you've seen us  do, in light of the \\n– probably the need to continue building to have a bit of a buffer, as you said, the uncertainty about the finalization of the rules. And also just \\nas a reminder, the SCB is probably a little bit low right now and has been quite volatile. So, that's another factor that we need to keep in mind . \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nMatt O’Connor  \\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.  Q \\nOkay. Thank you . \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.   A \\nThanks, Matt.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\n \\nOperator:  Next, we'll go to the line of John McDonald from Autonomous Research. You may proceed. . \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJohn McDonald  \\nAnalyst, Autonomous Research  Q \\nThanks. Jeremy, could you give a little more color on what's baked into the loan loss reserve in terms of kind of weighted av erage \\nassumptions and how any change in macro outlook played into the dynamics of the reserve builds and releases this quarter ? \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. Actually, John, this quarter, that's all like pretty quiet. So, the weighted average unemployment rate number is still 5.5%. We didn't have \\nany really big revisions in the macro outlook driving the numbers, and our skew remains as it has been – a little bit skewed to the downside. \\nJust recognizing that we still see risks being elevated, which obviously you can see that skew in the difference between the weighted average \\nunemployment of 5.5%, and what's in our central outlook, which I think is somethin g like 4.6% (sic) [4.4%]  peak of the current levels.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJohn McDonald  \\nAnalyst, Autonomous Research  Q \\nOkay. And then, just to follow up on the NII, could you give us some sensitivity to that outlook when you flex the amount of Fed cuts? Like \\nwhat's the impact of a few Fed cuts and how much does it matter like for the first two versus if you're thinking four, five, six? I know  it's \\ncomplicated, but maybe a little bit of color on like how sensitive you are to a couple of cuts might be helpful . \\n............ ............................................................................................................................. .........................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nSure. Yeah, happy to do that, John. So, I think probably the best way to do this is to look at our EaR numbers. So, as you kn ow, we don't \\nupdate that until the Q. But on an estimated basis, it's going to be a little bit low er. So, I think something like $1.9 billion as opposed to $2.1 \\nbillion. So, just round numbers, about $2 billion in EaR. I think, empirically, the number is maybe a little higher than that  just because even \\nthough we do model lags in the EaR, we've been se eing the lag effect be a little bit bigger. But just crudely, I think as I noted, we do remain \\nasset -sensitive. That's one way to quantify it. I would say the empirical number would maybe be a little higher than that, and hope fully, that \\ngives you enough t o work with . \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJohn McDonald  \\nAnalyst, Autonomous Research  Q \\nOkay. Thanks . \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\n \\n6 \\n \\n \\nOperator:  Next, we'll go to the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. You may proceed . \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................   \\nJim Mitchell  \\nAnalyst, Seapor t Global Securities LLC  Q  \\nHey. Good morning. Maybe just to follow up in a different way on the NII question, just in deposits, can you, Jeremy, discuss  your assumptions \\non the reprice and migration thoughts? And then, layering in if we do get six cuts, does that start to change the dynamic around growth in \\ndeposits? How are you thinking about all that ? \\n............................................................................................................................. ....................... ..............................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. Both good questions. So let's do reprice first. So, I think all else equal, this more dovish Fed environment and these six cuts has the \\neffect of taking a little bit of pressure off the reprice, especially product -level reprice. At the same time, we do continue to expect internal \\nmigration, particularly out of checking and savings into CDs, and in Who lesale, a little bit of ongoing migration out of non -interest -bearing into \\ninterest -bearing.  \\n \\nAnd that trajectory, I would expect to continue even in a lower rate environment. So, as a result, if you look at weighted av erage rate paid, for \\nexample, for the consumer deposit franchise, we would actually expect that number to be a little bit higher, just even in a world with six  cuts. \\nAnd that's actually intuitive when you think about it, as people continue migrating into CDs, but maybe a little non -intuiti ve if you're kind of \\ntrying to do beta type math with like change in rates and change in rate paid. It gets a little bit non -intuitive.  \\n \\nAnd then, in terms of balances, yeah, you'll note that I said that our outlook is for balances to be very modestly down , which when you \\nconsider the QT, despite the various speculations about having it slow down later in the year, continues and that loan growth  in the system as \\na whole is expected to be quite muted. It's a pretty modest decline outlook consistent with the lower rates. So, I kind of agree with you that this \\nenvironment is at the margin, a little bit more supportive for system -wide deposit balances. And then, obviously, we continue to be optimistic \\nabout our ability to take share in deposits based on our cust omer value proposition across all of our different businesses . \\n............................................................................................................................. .................................................................... .................................  \\nJim Mitchell  \\nAnalyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC  Q \\nRight. Okay. Thanks a lo t. \\n............................................................................................................................. ............... .....................................................................................  \\n \\nOperator:  Next, we'll go to the line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may proceed . \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nEbrahim H. Poonawala  \\nAnalyst,  Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Q \\nHey. Good morning. I guess maybe one question looking at your statement, and I think Jamie is quoted as saying as he sees the  consumer as \\nresilient and the market expecting a soft landing. I would love to hear – I'm not sure Jamie's on the call – but maybe, Jeremy, I would love to \\nhear your thoughts around do you believe that the outlook for a soft landing has increased? Is the market pricing in correctl y? Or when you \\nlook at your customer base, are you still worried abou t the lagged effects of the rate hikes ? \\n............................................................................................................................. ........................................................................................... ..........  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nRight. Okay, Ebrahim. So, I think a lot of those things aren't actually mutually exclusive. So, statement one, I think it's u ncontroversial that the \\neconomic outlook has evolved to include a significantly higher probability of a soft landing. That's, I think, the consensus at this point. So, \\nwhether you believe it or not is a separate issue, but I think that is the consensus.  \\n \\nIn terms of consumer resilience, I made some c omments about this on the press call. The way we see it, the consumer is fine. All of the \\nrelevant metrics are now effectively normalized. And the question really, in light of the fact that cash buffers are now also  normal, but that that \\nmeans that consume rs have been spending more than they're taking in, is how that spending behavior adjusts as we go into the new year in a \\nworld where their cash buffers are less comfortable than they were.  \\n \\n \\n7 \\n \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nSo, one can speculate about different trajectories that that could take. But I do think it's important to take a step back an d remind ourselves \\nthat consistent with that soft landing view, just in the central case modeling – obviously, we always worry abou t the tail scenarios – is a very \\nstrong labor market. And a very strong labor market means, all else equal, strong consumer credit. So, that's how we see the world . \\n........................................................................................... ............................................................................................................................. ..........  \\nEbrahim H. Poonawala  \\nAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Q \\nAnd maybe just taking that a step further, there has been concern around whether we see some of the CRE pain filter into multi -family \\napartments. You all have a pretty large multi -family exposure, high quality. But just give us a sense of, one, are you seeing any bleed -through \\nof what we've seen in office in  other areas of commercial real estate or any particular parts of C&I lending? Thank you . \\n............................................................................................................................. ......................................... ............................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A  \\nYeah. So, good question on the multi -family, and the short answer is that, for us, it's pretty uncontroversially  no – no bleed -through. And the \\nreason is that while we are aware of some of the pressure on multi -family, that's in kind of different markets from the ones that we are actually \\nbig in. So, it's higher -end stuff in much less supply constrained markets that is under more pres sure. And as you know, our multi -family \\nportfolio is much more affordable, supply constrained markets. And so, the performance there remains really very robust . \\n............................................................................................... ............................................................................................................................. ...... \\nEbrahim H. Poonawala  \\nAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Q \\nGot it.  Thank you.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n. \\nOperator:  Next, we'll go to  the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. You may proceed .  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nErika Najarian  \\nAnalyst, UBS S ecurities LLC  Q \\nHi. Good morning. My first question is a follow -up on Matt's with regarding the buyback. You printed 15% CET1 in the quarter. On a net basis, \\nnet of RWA growth, your net income produces 51 basis points every quarter. Again, that's net of R WA growth. I'm wondering what guideposts \\nyou're looking for, Jeremy, in terms of that buyback increasing from that $2 billion a quarter. Do we need to wait for Basel III finalization, which \\nseems like it could be quite delayed? Or will having clarity in th e June D -FAST results – you mentioned the SCB – sort of be enough that you \\ncould reconsider this pace over the medium term ? \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. Erika, that's a good question. And I understand what you're asking – why you're asking it. I think the answer is going to be a little bit \\nunsatisfying, which is that this is classic decision -making under uncertainty and it's kind of a probabilistic cloud of a variety of different factors. \\nBut, all the ingredients that you've listed are the r ight ingredients; right, very strong organic capital generation, uncertainty about the \\nfinalization of the rule, uncertainty about the SCB requirements, and obviously, our normal capital hierarchy, which is that buybacks are always \\nat the bottom of the hie rarchy after we're done using the capital for our other priorities.  \\n \\nSo, I think what I said previously stands, which is that we're sticking with the modest pace for now. But obviously, we have a lot of flexibility to \\nadjust that whenever we want under the  current regime, and we may well do that . \\n............................................................................................................................. ......................................................................................... ............  \\nErika Najarian  \\nAnalyst, UBS Securities LLC  Q \\nThanks. And just as a follow -up, the $90 billion in expenses for 2024, does that contemplate a significant increase or the comeback of \\ninvestment banking that everybody seems to be expecting for 2024 ? \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\n8 \\n \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nA little bit of that is in there, yeah. So, you would see that. We often talk about the volume in revenue related category, a nd I think in my \\nprepared remarks, you will have noted that I talked  about a $1 billion increase in that category year -on-year as a result of an improved NIR \\noutlook. So, the hope and expectation of a continued rebound in the investment banking wallet and our share of that is part of that . \\n................................. ............................................................................................................................. ....................................................................  \\nErika Najarian  \\nAnalyst, UBS Securities LLC  Q \\nThank you.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\nOperator:  Next, we'll go to the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed . \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nMike Mayo  \\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC  Q \\nHi. So, you're guiding to $90 billion of expenses, that's up $7 billion year -over-year. Seems like quite a big increase. And if you could just give \\nsome color on that. I know we've been through this before two years ago with the big  increase in expenses and without a lot of visibility. So, if \\nyou could just upfront give us visibility, how much of that is due to incentive pay, how much is that due to tech, how much i s that due to AI and \\nwhat are the expected returns to get from that $ 7 billion pick -up? Thanks . \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. Mike, thanks for the question. And yeah – and of course, you will, as I noted, be hearing more from us at Investor Day and between now \\nand Investor Day. But I will take a little bit of extr a time here to answer your question, because you're right, it's important to give you the \\ntransparency. And I'm going to follow the structure that we used on the page and go through each line of business.  \\n \\nSo, starting with CCB, it's the biggest dollar dri ver overall. It's an 8% increase year -on-year, which is about the same as we had last year. One \\nkey driver is the branch strategy and the associated staff for that. In 2023, we built 166 new branches, and we're planning a bout a similar \\nnumber this year. Ma rketing is also a driver. We're seeing great opportunities, great demand and engagement in our Card products. And so, \\nthat shows up in marketing. And as you well know, our wealth strategy in CCB remains a big focus and priority.  \\n \\nI think it's worth noting here, right, that as we've talked about and as you know, Mike, some of our investments are designed to produce short -\\nterm payoffs and some of them are much longer -term and some of them are just table stakes. But we actually see quite a bit of evidence of \\ncurrent payoffs in our current results in the CCB investment. So, for example, in 2023, we had 2 million net new checking acco unts. We had \\nan 8% growth in active card accounts. And over the last three years, we've increased deposit market share by 180 basis  points. So, as we've \\noften said about the company as a whole, we're very happy to be producing very good current returns and growth while investin g for the \\nfuture.  \\n \\nIn AWM, continued client advisor hiring is a key driver, as well as making sure that both the advisors and all of their new clients have the \\nsupport that they need. And a little bit to the prior question, in AWM, we also have a little bit of volume and revenue -related driver tied to an \\nimproved revenue outlook.  \\n \\nThe Commercial Bank is an i nteresting story in the sense that about half of it is the exit rate impact of ads that we did in the middle of the year \\nbased on market disruption and all the kind of new clients and new loans that we saw and the need to support that across the entire \\necosystem. As well as the fact that that created an opportunity in the middle of the year to accelerate our longstanding and pre existing \\ninnovation economy strategy. So, we took some opportunities to onboard some key teams in different parts of the franchise.  And then, as you \\nlook into 2024, it's really pretty consistent themes to the ones that we had before, including hiring bankers both domestical ly and \\ninternationally.  \\n \\nThe CIB story is a little bit different. The percentage growth there is lower, which rec ognizes, I think, both our very, very strong share positions \\nas a starting point and also the fact that we've been investing quite aggressively for some time in the Payments business, wh ich has produced \\nmeaningful payoffs already there in terms of signific ant share gains. So, as a result, the biggest driver in the CIB is really generic inflation, \\nincluding labor as well as, again to the prior question, volume and revenue -related increases tied to the improved NIR outlook. And I do want \\nto say for the avoida nce of doubt that despite all of this, our core strategy of looking very granularly at all the areas of strength and weakness  \\nand making sure that we're upgrading where appropriate to have absolutely the best talent in the CIB remains fully in effect.  \\n \\n9 \\n \\nJere my Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nFinally, you'll note that I haven't actually talked about technology in any of the businesses, and that's actually because ev en though all of the \\nbusinesses in various ways are investing in technology and spending money on it, the drivers are actually very consistent across the entire \\nfirm, even though it's very bottoms -up driven. And those drivers are consistent with what they've been, new products, features and customer \\nplatforms, as well a s modernization. So, that's happening throughout the company both at the app level and otherwise. And I will say actually \\nin closing, talking about technology – which I think is interesting – that to the point about a driver being growth writ large, one of  the things that \\nwe see is higher volume -related technology expense throughout the company. So, thanks for the question, Mike. It was a good opportunity to \\ngive you guys a bit more color here . \\n............................................................... ............................................................................................................................. ......................................   \\nMike Mayo  \\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC  Q \\nOkay. I have a short follow -up. I'm still here . \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nSure . \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nMike Mayo  \\nAnalyst, Wells Farg o Securities LLC  Q \\nYeah. Can you just talk about the impact of AI on your technology approach? And I know I’ve asked you this before and you sai d you're \\nspending it, you're being careful, you want to see a return on your dollars. But how much difference can this make? How big is your tech \\nbudget last year? How much should it be this year? How much could AI make a difference? Just a little more meat on the tech b ones . \\n.............................................................................. ............................................................................................................................. .......................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah, sure. So, let me address the AI point, and I think maybe I won't go into a lot of quantitative detail on this stuff and I'll save that for \\nInvestor Day, if you don't mind. But, I will address the AI point. So, as you may be aware, we actually have Teresa Heitsenre ther now running \\nthe AI strategy for the company as a member of the Operating Committee, which I think is an indication of the priority that we place  on this, \\nand in partnership with Lori and all of the technology organization.  \\n \\nSo, I think that – I think of this as being a littl e bit barbelled, where on the one hand, we're very excited about this. There's clearly some very \\nsignificant opportunities, not for nothing, starting with technology developers themselves in terms of the opportunity for si gnificantly increased \\nproductivity  there. At the same time, we're JPMorgan Chase. We're not going to be chasing shiny objects here in AI. We want to do this in an \\nextremely disciplined way, it's very commercial and very linked to tangible outcomes. And so, the current focus is on making sure we have a \\ncontained, well -chosen list of high -impact use cases and that we're throwing resources at those in the right way, that's extremely pragmatic \\nand disciplined, and we're holding ourselves accountable for actual results . \\n......................... ............................................................................................................................. ............................................................................  \\nMike Mayo  \\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC  Q \\nAll right. Thank you . \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nThanks, Mike . \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\nOperator:  Next, we'll go to the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed . \\n............................................................................................................................. ............................................................. ........................................  \\n \\n10 \\n \\nGerard Cassidy  \\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC  Q \\nHi, Jeremy. How are you ? \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nHey, Gerard . \\n............................................................................................................................. .................................................................................... .................  \\nGerard Cassidy  \\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC  Q  \\nJeremy, coming back to your outlook and forecast for net interest income for the upcoming year with the six Fed fund rate cut s that you guys \\nare assuming, can you give us a little insight why you're assuming six cuts? Is it your customers are telling you that their businesses are \\nweaker or is it your just economic outlook, the forward curve? Can you give us something behind why you're assuming so many r ate cuts ? \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. Gerard, I wish the answer were more interesting, but it's just our practice. We just always use the forward curve for o ur outlook, and \\nthat's what's in there . \\n......................................................... ............................................................................................................................. ............................................  \\nGerard Cassidy  \\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC  Q \\nOkay, very good. And then, as a follow -up, obviously, you pointed out also in the outlook you're going to have some deposit attrition. You had \\nsome, of course, in 2023. Can you guys give us some insights on the impact QT is having on the deposit base for your organiza tion? And \\nsecond, ar e you surprised that QT hasn't been more disruptive to the liquidity in the markets ? \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. Good question, Gerard. I mean, I think you've heard Jamie talk about this a lot. QT is obviously a big focus and one of  the complicating \\nelements that we have in the current environment. I think that the math is the math in the sense that QT, all else equal, is withdrawing from \\nsystem -wide deposits. In the last six months of this year, that's been offset, hopefully, by a reduction in the size of RRP. And so,  that's been \\nsupportive of system -wide deposits.  \\n \\nAs we g o into 2024, RRP is at lower levels, and so that may be a little bit less of a tailwind. But it's also the case, as you know,  that there's – \\nthe market's expectation is that QT is going to start slowing down at some point this year. So – and we still have reasonable levels of reserves \\nand some cushion from RRP. So, that's part of the reason that our outlook is for deposits to be modestly down, with the shrin kage in system -\\nwide deposits maybe partially offset by our belief that we can take some share. But, a lso I think the second half of this year is going to be \\ninteresting to watch in terms of what the Fed does . \\n............................................................................................................................. ....................... ..............................................................................  \\nGerard Cassidy  \\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC  Q \\nGreat. Thank you . \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nThanks, Gerard . \\n............................................................................................................................. ........................................................................ .............................  \\n \\nOperator:  Next, we'll go to the line of Manan Gosalia from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed . \\n............................................................................................................................. ....................................................................................................  \\n \\n11 \\n \\nManan Gosalia  \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nHey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. There has been a lot of talk about capital markets rebound. You noted you' re starting the \\nyear with a healthy pipeline. Could you give us some more color on what you're seeing there and how the rate in – how the change in the rate \\nenvironment is changing the conversations that you're having across M&A, ECM and DCM ? \\n................................................................................................................... ...............................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah, sure. So, as you know, all else equal, this more dovish rate environment is of course supportive for capital markets. So, if you go into \\nthe details a little bit, if you start with ECM, that helps. Higher and – well, the recent rally in the equity markets helps. I think there've been \\nsome modest challenges with the 2023 IPO vintage in terms of post -launch performance or whatever. So, that's a little bit of a headwind at the \\nmargin in terms of converting the pipeline, but I'm not too concerned about that in general. So, I would expect to see reboun d there.  \\n \\nIn DCM, ag ain, all else equal, lower rates are clearly supportive. One of the nuances there is the distinction between the absolute lev el of rates \\nand the rate of change, that sometimes you see corporates seeing and expecting lower rates, and therefore, waiting to r efinance in the hope \\nof even lower rates. So, that can go both ways. And then, M&A is a slightly different dynamic. I think there's a couple nuanc es there. One, as \\nyou obviously know, announced volume was lower this year. So, that will be a headwind in rep orted revenues in 2024, all else equal. And of \\ncourse, we are in an environment of M&A regulatory headwinds, as has been heavily discussed. But having said that, I think we 're seeing a bit \\nof pick -up in deal flow, and I would expect the environment to be a  bit more supportive . \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nManan Gosalia  \\nAnalyst, Morgan  Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nGreat. And on the flip side, in C&I, you spoke about lower revolver utilization, more muted demand. What would it take for th at to rebound? Do \\nyou think it accelerates from here if rates come down or is there room for this to slow eve n further if the capital markets open up even more ? \\n............................................................................................................................. ............................................................................... ......................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A  \\nYeah. It's a good question. I mean, I think as you say, it's a little bit of a – I mean, I wouldn't necessarily say that, like, lack of debt market \\naccess in the last year, that was more of an earlier effect in terms of having that drive revolver utilization. I think the main driver the re is just a \\nlittle bit of residual anxiety in the C -suite, which increases as the companies get smaller in size.  \\n \\nSo, it's really going to be a function of how 2024 plays out. The softer the landing is, the more supported the utilization should be, I woul d \\nthink. If things turn out a little bit worse, I think management teams are going to be incrementally more cautious about CapE x and so on, and \\nso you might see utilization even lowe r. \\n............................................................................................................................. ............................................................................. ........................  \\nManan Gosalia  \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co.

A  \\nYeah . \\n............................................................................................................................. .......................................................................................... ...........  \\n \\nOperator:  Next, we'll go to the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. You may proceed.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nGlenn Schorr  \\nAnalyst, Evercor e ISI  Q \\nHi. Thank you. So, I want to get your perspective on private credit overall. The industry saw a lot of growth, but it's only so big relative to the \\nbanking market. I think there's been a lot of share shift in direct lending and middle market lending. But n ow, you're starting to see more in  \\n \\n12 \\n \\nGlenn Schorr  \\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI  Q \\nasset -backed finance and you're seeing them raise a lot of money in infrastructure and energy. So, my question to you is, how big o f a trend is \\nthis? How much do you think about it as cyclical versus secular? And most importantly, how does JPMorgan adapt and participate?  \\n............................................................................................................................. ........................................ .............................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A  \\nYeah. Thanks, Glenn. So, I think the last part of your question, as you say, is the most important part, which is this as an important factor in \\nthe competitive dynamic and what is one of the key things that we offer as a company. So, it is a meaningful shift in the env ironment and \\nsomething that we've been watching for some time.  \\n \\nWe've made some enhancements and some new initi atives to ensure that we can compete effectively both in our traditional syndicated \\nlending businesses, but also go head -to-head with the private credit providers in these types of unitranche structures, if and when that's what \\nthe client actually wants. I t tends to be a trade -off between the best possible pricing versus speed and certainty of execution, and we can \\nprovide both off our sort of exceptionally strong long -time DCM franchise. So, that's been a priority, and we're actually already starting to se e \\nsome results from that across both the Commercial Bank and the CIB with certain client segments.  \\n \\nAnd in the bigger picture, of course, in the context of the Basel III Endgame, people talk a lot about the risk of certain le nding activity getting \\npushed o ut of the regulated perimeter. It's important to be clear, right, these are important clients of ours too. We compete with th em. They're \\nalso clients. And in the end, our point here is just people, and regulators in particular, should just be aware of the likely consequences of \\nwhat's happening here and make sure that the results are intentional and that we're looking around the corner a little bit.  \\n............................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................................  \\nGlenn Schorr  \\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI  Q \\nAnything specific on asset -backed? It's an important part of your business too. Do you see it following the same path as direct lending ha s? \\n............................................................................................................................. .................................................................................... .................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nIt's interesting. I haven't heard much about that, Glenn. So, we can look into it for you. But to be honest, the fact that I haven't heard much \\nmakes me think that it's maybe not such a big driver right now . \\n............................................................................................................................. .................................................................................................. ... \\nGlenn Schorr  \\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI  Q \\nOkay, cool. Thank you for that . \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\nOperator:  And for our final question, we'll go to the line of Charles Peabody from Portales Partners. You may proceed . \\n............................................................................................................................. ....................................................................................................  \\nCharles W. Peabody  \\nAnalyst, Po rtales Partners LLC  Q \\nThank you. I have a question about the role that First Republic plays in your NII forecast. I'm assuming, because you'll have  a full year in 2024 \\nof First Republic that their contribution of NII will be up, let's say, from $3.7 billi on this year to $5 billion to $6 billion next year. But given that \\nyou're forecasting six rate cuts, is that a detractor to your assumptions of NII from First Republic? Or – I mean, you have that FDIC note, and \\nthen you also have a significant amount of ad justable rate mortgages that I assume are repricing upwards. So, if you're talking about rate cuts, \\nthat would hurt your NII forecast from First Republic, I'm guessing. But if rates stay higher for longer, wouldn't First Repu blic be a much bigger \\ncontribut or? So, talk about the sensitivities of First Republic there . \\n............................................................................................................................. ..................................................................... ................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. Thanks, Charlie. So, one thing that we said when we kind of gave First Republic guidance at Investor Day earlier this y ear is that while \\nwe understood the need to track that, and we've been splitting out First Republic in our reported results in orde r to improve period -on-period  \\n \\n13 \\n \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\ncomparability, we kind of want to stay out of the business of guiding on First Republic. And so, we really focused on having our guidance be \\nFirmwide, including F irst Republic, now that everything is embedded in the franchise.  \\n \\nHaving said that, let me just react to a couple of the things that you said. So, again, I don't want to get into like micro -validation one way or the \\nother of some of your back -of-the-envelo pe math. But we did have some accelerated pull to par on some of the accretion of some of the loans \\nthat we purchased this year. So, I think the annualization that you're doing is maybe a bit high for the 2024 number. And the n, from a \\nsensitivities perspec tive, I actually think I can simplify the math for you a little bit and just kind of direct you to the EaR per my response to  the \\nprior question. Because that EaR fully includes all of the First Republic assets and liabilities with all of the various dyna mics. And so, I think \\nthat's kind of like an easier way to think about it for the company . \\n............................................................................................................................. ......................................... ............................................................  \\nCharles W. Peabody  \\nAnalyst, Portales Partners LLC  Q \\nJust to make sure I understood what you're saying, so you have NII ex. Markets going from $94 billion to $88 billion. Within that, would the \\ncontribution from First Republic be down as well or up ? \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nIt's going to hit… the day we did it, so.. . \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. I mean, I can probably answer that question if I think about it for a second, but it sort of violates my prior statemen t that I really don't \\nwant to get into the business of guiding on First Republic. If I do the big picture, right, so big picture, 2023, we had eight months of First \\nRepublic NII. 2024, we're going to have 12. So, all else equal, there's calendarization in there. What's also true is that in  2023, as a result of \\nthe impact of the NII of the pull to p ar of certain relatively short -dated assets that we fair -valued at a meaningful discount as part of the \\ntransaction, that sort of – that pull to par happens quite quickly, and therefore, probably juiced the 2023 number a little bit. So, therefore, \\nstraight  annualization is probably not the right way to think about it. Then, you just get into the questions about the FTP and the fu nding and \\nwhatever, and then this is like too complicated. So, I'd rather not go there . \\n.......................................... ............................................................................................................................. ...........................................................  \\nCharles W. Peabody  \\nAnalyst, Portales Partners LLC  Q \\nAll right. Thank you . \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\nOperator:  And we do have no further questions at this time . \\n............................................................................................................................. ..................................................................................... ................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.   \\nOkay.

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. This call is being \\nrecorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presen tation. Please standby.  \\n \\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Offic er, Jeremy \\nBarnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead . \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  \\nThank you very much, and good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website  and please refer to the disclaimer in the \\nback.  \\n \\nStarting  on page 1  – the firm reported net income of $13.4 billion, EPS of $4.44 on revenue of $4 2.5 billion  and delivered an ROTCE of 21%. \\nThese results included a $725 million increase to the special assessment resulting from the FDIC's updated estimate of expected losses from \\nthe closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Touching on a co uple of highlights. Firm wide IB fees were up 18% year -on-year, \\nreflecting particular strength in underwriting fees, and we've seen strong net inflows across AWM as well as in the CCB Wealt h Management \\nbusiness.  \\n \\nOn page 2, we have some more detail. This i s the last quarter we'll discuss results excluding First Republic given that, going forward, First \\nRepublic results will naturally be included in the prior period, making year -on-year results comparable. For this quarter, First Republic \\ncontributed $1.7 bi llion of revenue, $806 million of expense and $668 million of net income.  \\n \\nNow, focusing on the Firmwide results excluding First Republic  – revenue of $40.9 billion was up $1.5 billion or 4% year -on-year. NII ex . \\nMarkets was up $736 million or 4%, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates as well as higher revolving bal ances in Card, \\nlargely offset by deposit margin compression and lower deposit balances in CCB. NIR ex . Markets was up $1.2 billion  or 12%, driven by higher \\nFirmwide Asset Management and Investment Banking fees as well as lower net investment securities losses. And Markets revenue was down \\n$400 million or 5% year -on-year.  \\n \\nExpenses of $22 billion were up $1.8 billion or 9% year -on-year, driven by higher compensation, including growth in employees and the \\nincrease to the FDIC's special assessment. And credit costs were $1.9 billion, reflecting net charge -offs of $2 billion and a net reserve release \\nof $38 million. Net charge -offs were up $ 816 (sic)  million, predominately driven by Card.  \\n \\nOn the balance sheet and capital, on page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15%, relatively flat versus the prior quarter, reflecting \\nnet income which was predominantly o ffset by higher RWA and capital distribution. This quarter's higher RWA is largely due to seasonal \\neffects including higher client activity in Markets and higher risk weights on deferred tax assets, partially offset by lower  Card loans.  \\n \\nNow, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 4. Consumers remain  financially healthy supported by a resilient labor market. \\nWhile cash buffers have largely normalized, balances are still above pre -pandemic levels and wages are keeping pace with inflation. W hen \\nlooking at a stable cohort of customers, overall spend is in line with the prior year.  \\n \\nTurning now to the financial results , excluding First Republic. CCB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $16.6 billion, which was \\nup 1% year -on-year. I n Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was down 4% year -on-year, reflecting lower NII on lower deposits with \\naverage balances down 7%, as our CD mix increased. Client investment assets were up 25% year -on-year, driven by market p erformance \\nand strong net inflows. In Home Lending, revenue was up 10% year -on-year, predominantly driven by higher NII and production revenue. \\nOriginations, while still modest, were up 10%.  \\n \\nMoving to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 8% year -on-year, driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially \\noffset by higher Card acquisition costs from new account growth and lower auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 13% du e to strong \\naccount acquisition and the continued normal ization of revolve. And in Auto, originations were $8.9 billion, down 3%, while we maintained \\nhealthy margins and market share.  \\n \\nExpenses of $8.8 billion were up 9% year -on-year, largely driven by field compensation and continued growth in technology and m arketing. In \\nterms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.9 billion, driven by net charge -offs which were up $825 million year -on-year, \\npredominately due to continued normalization in Card. The net reserve build was $45 million, reflectin g the build in Card, largely offset by a \\nrelease in Home Lending . \\n \\n \\n3 \\n \\nNext, the Corporate & Investment Bank on page 5. Before reporting CIB's results, I want to note that this will also be the la st quarter we will \\nreport earnings for the CIB and CB as standal one segments. Between now and Investor Day, we will furnish an 8 K with historical results \\nincluding five quarters and two full years of history consistent with the structure of the new Commercial and Investment Bank segment, in line \\nwith the re -organization that was announced in January.  \\n \\nTurning back to this quarter, CIB reported net income of $4.8 billion on revenue of $13.6 billion. Investment Banking revenue  of $2 billion was \\nup 27% year -on-year. IB fees were up 21% year -on-year and we ranked number one with year -to-date wallet share of 9.1%. In Advisory, fees \\nwere down 21%, driven by fewer large completed deals. Underwriting fees were up significantly, benefiting from improved marke t conditions , \\nwith debt up 58% and equity up 51 %. \\n \\nIn terms of the outlook, while we're encouraged by the level of capital markets activity we saw this quarter, we need to be m indful that some \\nmeaningful portion of that is likely pulling forward from later in the year. Similarly, while it was encouragi ng to see some positive momentum in \\nannounced M&A in the quarter, it remains to be seen whether that will continue and the Advisory business still faces structural headwinds from \\nthe regulatory environment. Payments revenue was $2.4 billion, down 1% year-on-year, as deposit margin normalization and deposit -related \\nclient credits were largely offset by higher fee -based revenue and deposit balances.  \\n \\nMoving to Markets, total revenue was $8 billion, down 5% year -on-year. Fixed income was down 7%, driven by lower activity in Rates and \\nCommodities compared to a strong prior -year quarter, partially offset by strong results in Securitized Products. Equity Markets was flat. \\nSecurities Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 3% year -on-year. Expenses of $7.2 bi llion were down 4% year -on-year, predominantly \\ndriven by lower legal expense.  \\n \\nMoving to the Commercial Bank on page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.6 billion. Revenue of $3.6 billion was up 3% year -\\non-year, drive n by higher non -interest revenue. Gross Investment Banking and Markets revenue of $913 million was up 4% year -on-year, with \\nincreased IB fees largely offset by lower markets revenue compared to a strong prior  year quarter.  \\n \\nPayments revenue of $1.9 billio n was down 2% year -on-year, driven by lower deposit margins and balances, largely offset by fee growth net \\nof higher deposit -related client credits. Expenses of $1.5 billion were up 13% year -on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, \\nreflecting an increase in employees including front office and technology investments, as well as higher volume -related expense.  \\n \\nAverage deposits were down 3% year -on-year, primarily driven by lower non -operating deposits and down 1% quarter -on-quarter, reflecting \\nseasonally lower balances. Loans were flat quarter -on-quarter. C&I loans were down 1 %, reflecting muted demand for new loans as clients \\nremain cautious. And CRE loans were flat as higher rates continued to have an impact on originations and payof f activity.  \\n \\nFinally, credit costs were a net benefit of $35 million, including a net reserve release of $101 million and net charge -offs of $66 million.  \\n \\nThen to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1 billion, with pre -tax margin \\nof 28%. Revenue of $4.7 billion was down 1% year -on-year. Excluding net investment valuation gains in the prior year, revenue was up 5%, \\ndriven by higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels, partially offset by lower NII due to deposit margin \\ncompression.  \\n \\nExpenses of $3.4 billion were up 11% year -on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, including revenue -related compensation, \\ncontinued growth in our private banking adv isor teams and the impact of the J .P. Morgan Asset Management China acquisition as well as \\nhigher distribution  fees.  \\n \\nFor the quarter, long -term net inflows were $34 billion, led by Equities and Fixed Income. AUM of $3.6 trillion was up 19% year -on-year and \\nclient assets of $5.2 trillion were up 20% year -on-year, driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows. And finally, loans were down \\n1% quarter -on-quarter and deposits were flat.  \\n \\nTurning to Corporate on page 8, Corporate reported net income of $918 million. Revenue was $2.3 billion, up $1.3 billion year -on-year. NII \\nwas $2.5 billion, up $737 million year -on-year driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates. NIR was a net loss of $188 million. \\nThe current  quarter included net investment securities losses of $366 million compared with net securities losses of $868 million in the prior \\nyear quarter. Expenses of $1 billion were up $889 million year -on-year, predominately driven by the increase to the FDIC special assessment.  \\n \\nTo finish up, we have the outlook on page 9. We now expect NII ex . Markets to be approximately $89 billion based on a forward curve that \\ncontained three rate cuts at quarter  end. Our total NII guidance remains approximately $ 90 billion, which implies a decrease in our Market s NII \\nguidance from around $2 billion to around $1 billion. The primary driver of that reduction is balance sheet growth and mix sh ift in the Markets \\nbusiness, and as a reminder, changes in Markets NII a re generally revenue neutral.  \\n \\nOur outlook for adjusted expense is now about $91 billion, reflecting the increase to the FDIC special assessment I mentioned  upfront. And on \\ncredit, we continue to expect the 2024 Card net charge -off rate to be below 3.5%.  \\n \\n \\n4 \\n \\nFinally, you may have noticed that our effective tax rate has increased this quarter and it will likely stay around 23% this year absent discrete \\nitems, which can vary quite a bit. The driver of this change is the firm's adoption of the proportional amort ization method for certain tax equity \\ninvestments. Our managed rate is unchanged and it should average about 3.5% above the effective tax rate. This is a smaller g ap than we \\npreviously observed and we expect this approximate relationship to persist going f orward although the difference will continue to fluctuate as it \\nhas in the past.  \\n \\nFor the avoidance of doubt, these changes have no meaningful impact on expected annual net income ; we're just mentioning this to help with \\nyour models.  \\n \\nSo, to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating results even as the journey towards NII normalization begins. While we  \\nremain confident in our ability to produce strong returns and manage risk across a range of scenarios, the economic, geopolit ical and \\nregulatory uncertainties that we have been talking about for some time remain prominent and we are focused on being prepared to navigate \\nthose challenges as well as any others that may come our way.  \\n \\nAnd with that, let's open up the line for Q&A.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\n \\nQUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION  \\n  \\nOperator : The first question is coming from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed . \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nBetsy L. Graseck  \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nHi. Good morning.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJamie Dimon  \\nCha irman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMo rgan Chase & Co.  A \\nMorning . \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nBetsy L. Graseck  \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nSo, a couple of questions here. Just, one, Jamie, could you talk through the decision to raise the dividend kind of mid -cycle, it felt like, pre -\\nCCA R? And also , help us understand how you're thinking about where that payout ratio, that dividend payout ratio , range should be. Because \\nover the past several years, it's been somewhere between 24% and 32%. And so, is this suggesting we could be towards the  higher -end of \\nthat range or even expanding above that?  \\n \\nAnd then I also just wanted to understand the buyback and the keeping of the CET1 at 15% here. The minimum is 11.9%. I know i t's – we \\nhave to wait for Basel III Endgame re -proposal to come through a nd all that , but should we be expecting that, hey, we're going to hold 15% \\nCET1 until we know all these rules? Thanks . \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJamie Dimon  \\nCha irman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMo rgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. So, Betsy, before I answer the question , I want to say something on behalf of all of us at JPMorgan and , me personally, thrilled to have \\nyou on this call. For those that don't know, Betsy has been through a terrible medical episode  and it's a reminder to all of us how lucky we are \\nto be here. B ut, Betsy, in particular, the amount of respect we have , not just in your work , but in your character over the last 20  plus years has \\nbeen exceptional. So, on behalf of all of us, I just want to welcome you back and thrilled to have you here.  \\n \\nAnd so, you 're asking a  pertinent  question. So, we're earning a lot of money. Our capital cup runneth over, and that's why we've increased the \\ndividend. And if you're asking me what we'd like to do is to pay out something like a third, a third of normalized earnings.  Of course, it's hard to \\ncalculate always what normalized earnings are, but we don't mind being a little bit ahead of that sometimes, a little bit beh ind that sometimes. \\nIf I could give people kind of consistent dividend guidance, et cetera, I think the fa r more important question is the 15%. So, look at the 15% , \\nI'm going to oversimplify it , that basically will prepare us for the total Basel Endgame today, roughly. The specifics don't matter that much.  \\n \\n \\n \\n5 \\n \\nJamie Dimon  \\nCha irman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMo rgan Chase & Co.  A \\nRemember, we can do a lot of things to change that in the short -run or the long -run, but it looks like Basel III Endgame may not be the worst \\ncase. It'll be something less than that. So, obviously, when and if that happens, it would free up a lot of capital, and I'm going to say in the \\norder of $20 billion or something like that . \\n \\nAnd, yes, we've always had the capital hierarchy the same way, which is we're going to use capital to build our business firs t, I mean, pay the \\ndividend  – steady dividend, build the business, and if we think it's a ppropriate to buy back stock. We're continuing to buy back stock at $2 \\nbillion a quarter (sic) . I personally do not want to buy back a lot more than that at these current prices. I think you've all heard me talk about \\nthe world, things like that. So, w aiting in preparation for Basel. Hopefully we'll know something later, and then we can be much more specific \\nwith you all.  \\n \\nBut in the meantime, there's also – it's very important to put in mind, there are short -term uses for capital that are good for shareholders, that \\ncould reduce our CET1  too. So, you may see us do things in the short -run that will increase earnings, increase capital, that are using up that \\ncapital. Jeremy mentioned on the – on one of the things that we know, the balance sheet and how we use the balance sheet for credit and \\ntrading, we could do things now.  \\n \\nSo, it's a great position to be in. We're going to be very, very patient. I urge all the analysts to keep in mind, excess cap ital is not wasted \\ncapital, it's earnings in store. W e will deploy it in a very good way for shareholders in due course.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nBetsy L. Graseck  \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nExcellent. Thank you so much.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.   A \\nAnd yeah, Betsy, I just wanted to add my welcome back thoughts as well, and just a very minor edit to Jamie's answer. I think he just \\nmisspoke when he said $2 billion a year in buybacks. The trajectory is $2 billion.. . \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJamie Dimon  \\nCha irman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMo rgan Chase & Co.   A \\nOh. Sorry. $2 billion a quarter. Yeah.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.   A \\n...a quarter. Otherwise, I have nothing to add to Jamie's very complete answer. But welcome back, Betsy.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nBetsy L. Graseck  \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nOkay. Thank you so much, and appreciate it. Looking forward to seeing you at Investor Day on May 20 th. \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.   A \\nExcellent. Us too . \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\n \\nOperator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. You may proceed.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\n \\n \\n6 \\n \\nJim Mitchell  \\nAnalyst, Seapor t Global Securities LLC  Q \\nHey. Good morning. Jeremy, can you speak to the trends you're s eeing with respect to deposit migration in the quarter, if there's been any \\nchange? Have you seen that migration start to slow or not ? \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. Good  question, Jim. I think the simplest and best answer to that is : not really. So, as we've been saying for a while, migration from \\nchecking and savings to CDs is sort of the dominant trend with this driving the increase in weighted average rate paid in the  consumer deposit \\nfranchise , that continues. We continue to capture that money -in-motion at a very high rate. We're very happy about what that means about the \\nconsumer franchise and level of engagement that we're seeing.  \\n \\nI'm aware that there's a litt le bit of a narrative out there about are we seeing the end of what people sometimes refer to as cash sorting. We've \\nlooked at that data. We see some evidence that maybe it's slowing a little bit. We're quite cautious on that. We really sort of don't think  it \\nmakes sense to assume that in a world where checking and savings is paying effectively zero and the policy rate is above  5% that you're not \\ngoing to see ongoing migration.  \\n \\nAnd frankly, we expect to see that even in a world where – even if the current yield curve environment were to change and meaningful cuts \\nwere to get reintroduced and we would actually start to see those, we would still expect to see ongoing migration and yield -seeking behavior. \\nSo, it's quite conceivable and this is  actually on the yield curve that we had in fourth quarter that had six cuts in it. We were still nonetheless \\nexpecting an increase in weighted average rate paid as that migration continues. So, I would say no meaningful change in the trends and the \\nexpect ation for ongoing migration is very much still there . \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJim Mitchell  \\nAnalyst, Seapor t Global Securities LLC  Q \\nOkay. And just a follow -up on that and just sort of bigger picture on NII. Is that sort of the biggest driver of your outlook? Is it migration? I s it \\nthe forward curve? Is it balances? It sounds like it's migration, but just I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on the bigges t drivers of upside or \\ndownside . \\n............ ............................................................................................................................. .........................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. So, I mean I think the drivers of, let's say, what's embedded in the current guidance is actually not meaningfully different from what it \\nwas in the fourth quarter, meaning it's the current yield curve, which is a little bit stale now. But the snap from quarter -end had  roughly three \\ncuts in it. So, it's the current yield curve, it's what I just said, the expectation of ongoing internal migration. There is some meaningful offset \\nfrom Card revolve growth, which while it's a little bit less than it was in prior years, is s till a tailwind there.  \\n \\nWe expect deposit balances to be sort of flat to modestly down, so that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin. And then,  there's obviously \\nthe wild card of potential product level reprice, which we always say we're going to mak e those decisions situationally as a function of \\ncompetitive conditions in the marketplace, and you know this obviously, but in a world where we've got something like $900 bi llion of deposits \\npaying effectively zero, relatively small changes in the product  level reprice can change the NII run rate by a lot. So, the error  bands here are \\npretty wide, and we're always going to stick with our mantra, which has been not losing primary bank relationships and thinki ng about the long -\\nterm health of the franchise when we think about deposit pricing . \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJim Mitchell  \\nAnalyst, Seapor t Global Securities LLC  Q \\nRight. Okay. Great. Thanks for the color . \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nThanks . \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\n \\n \\n7 \\n \\nOperator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. You may proceed . \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................   \\nJohn McDonald  \\nAnalyst, Autonomous Research  Q \\nThanks. Jeremy, you had mentioned at a conference earlier this year that the Street might need to build in more reserve growt h – for the Card \\ngrowth, you've had more reserve build. We didn't s ee that this quarter. Is that just kind of seasonal? And would you still expect the kind of \\ngrowth math to play out in terms of Card growth and reserve build needs ? \\n............................................................................................................................. ....................... ..............................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah, John. So, in short,  yes to both questions. So, yes, the relative lack of build this quarter is a function of the normal seasonal patterns of \\nCard. Yes, we still expect 12% Card loan growth for the full year. And yes, that still means that all else equal, we think the conse nsus for the \\nallowance build for the back three quarters is still a little too low , if you map it to that expected Card loan growth.  \\n \\nObviously, there's the wild card of what happens with our probabilities and our parameters and the output of our internal  process of assessing \\nthe skew in the seasonal distribution and so on, and we're not speaking to that one way or the other. So, if guys have your o wn opinions about \\nthat, that's fine, but we're narrowly just saying that based on the Card loan growth that we expect and normal coverage ratios for that, we do \\nexpect build in the back half of the year . \\n............................................................................................................................. .................................................................... .................................  \\nJohn McDonald  \\nAnalyst, Autonomous Research  Q \\nOkay. Got it. And then just to follow up to make it super clear on the idea of the Markets  NII, that outlook  being revised down by $1 billion but \\nrevenue  neutral. I guess, the obvious thing is, there, there's typically an offset in fee income and you don't guide to that. But the  idea would be \\nthe way you're structuring trades, the way the ba lance sheet is evolving, there ’s some offset that you'd expect in Markets fees from the lower \\nMarkets NII , correct ? \\n............................................................................................................................. ............... .....................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nThat is exactly right. And specifically, what's going on here is there's shift between on -balance sheet and off -balance sheet in the financing \\nbusinesses and prime and so on within Markets. And you can actually see a little bit of a pop in the Markets balance sheet in  the supplement \\nand these things are all related. So,  fundamentally, you can think of it as like we either hold the equities on the balance sheet, non -interest -\\nbearing, high -funding expense, negative for NII, or we receive that in total return form through derivatives, exactly the same economics, n o \\nimpact o n NII.  \\n \\nSo, that shift is a function of the sort of borrowing relationships in the marketplace in ways that are bottom line effective ly neutral. It's second  \\norder effects, but they change the geography quite a bit, and that's what happened this quarter. A nd that's why we've been emphasizing for \\nsome time that the NII ex . Markets is the better number to focus on in terms of an indicator of how the core banking franchise is performing . \\n............................................................................................................................. .................................................................... .................................  \\nJohn McDonald  \\nAnalyst, Autonomous Research  Q \\nGot it.

Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. You may proceed . \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\n \\n8 \\n \\nEbrahim H. Poonawala  \\nAnalyst,  Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Q \\nHey. Goo d morning. I guess, just in terms of, Jeremy, when you think about the outlook for the economy, I would appreciate your thoug hts on \\nthe health of the customer base, both commercial and consumer. And when we think about higher -for-longer, maybe the economy is too \\nstrong  so we don't get any rate cuts, are you seeing that when you talk to your customers and the feedback you're getting from your bankers \\nwhere the momentum is picking up?  \\n \\nAnd I appreciate all the macro risks that Jamie has pointed out, but I'm just getting – trying to get to a sense of what your view is in terms of \\nthe most likely outcome based on what you're seeing today from the customers . \\n............................................................................................................................. ........................................................................................... ..........  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nCha irman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMo rgan Chase & Co.  A \\nI would sa y consumer customers are fine. The unemployment is very low. Home prices are up. Stock prices are up. The amount of income \\nthey need to service their debt is still kind of low, but the extra money of the lower -income folks is running out – not running out , but \\nnormaliz ing, and you see credit normalizing a little bit. And of course, higher -income folks still have more money, they're still spending it. So, \\nwhatever happens, the customer is in pretty good shape and they're – if they – you go into a r ecession, they'll be in pretty good shape.  \\n \\nBusinesses are in good shape. If you look at it today, their confidence is up, their order books are up, their profits are up . But what I caution \\npeople, these are all the same results of a lot of fiscal spending , a lot of QE, et cetera. And so, we don't really know what's going to happen. \\nAnd I also want to look at the year. Look at two years or three years, all the geopolitical effects and oil and gas and how m uch fiscal spending \\nwill actually take place, our el ections, et cetera.  \\n \\nSo, we're in good shape – we're okay right now. It does not mean we're okay down the road. And if you look at any inflection point, being okay \\nin the current time is always true. That was true in 1972. It was true in any time we've had  it. So, I just – I'm just on the more cautious side. \\nHow people feel and confidence levels and all that, that doesn't necessarily stop you from having an inflection point. And so , everything is \\nokay today, but you've got to be prepared for a range of outc omes, which we are.  \\n \\nAnd the other thing I want to point out, because all of these questions about interest rates and yield curves and NII and credit losses, it's – one \\nthing to project it today based on what – not what we think in economic scenarios, but the generally accepted economic scenario , which is the \\ngenerally accepted rate cuts of the Fed, but these numbers have always been wrong.  \\n \\nYou have to ask the question, what if other things happen like higher rates with this modest recession, et cetera? Then all these  numbers \\nchange. I just don't think any of us should be surprised if and when that happens. And I just think the chance of happeni ng is higher than other \\npeople. I don't know the outcome. We don't want to guess the outcome. I've never seen anyone actually positively predict big inflection point in \\nthe economy , literally in my life or in history . \\n........................................................................................... ............................................................................................................................. ..........  \\nEbrahim H. Poonawala  \\nAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Q \\nThat's helpful. And just tied to that, as we look at commercial real estate both for J .P. and for the economy overall, is higher rates alone \\nenough to create more vulnerability than issues beyond office CRE? Like, how woul d you characterize the health of the CRE market? Thank \\nyou. \\n............................................................................................................................. ......................................... ............................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nCha irman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMo rgan Chase & Co . A \\nYeah, so I'll put it into two buckets. Okay? First of all, we're fine. We've got good reserves against office. We think ou r multifamily is fine. \\nJeremy can give you more detail on that if you want.  \\n \\nBut if you think of real estate, there's two pieces. If rates go up, think of the yield curve. The whole yield curve, not Fed  funds, but the 10 -year \\nbond rate, it goes up 2%, all assets, all assets, every asset on the planet, including real estate, is worth 20% less. Well, obviously, that creates \\na little bit of stress and strain, and people have to roll those over and finance it more. That's not just true for real esta te, it's tru e for everybody. \\nAnd that happens, leveraged loans, real estate will have some effect.  \\n \\nThe second thing is the, why does that happen? If that happens because we have a strong economy, well, that's not so bad for real estate \\nbecause people will be hiring a nd throwing  things out and other financial assets. If that happens because we have stagflation, well that ’s the  \\n \\n9 \\n \\nJamie Dimon  \\nCha irman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMo rgan Chase & Co . A \\nworst case. All of a sudden, you are going to have more vacancies, you are going to have more companies cutting back, you are going to  \\nhave less leases. It will affect – including multifamily, that will filter through the whole economy in a way that we – people haven't really \\nexperienced since 2010.  \\n \\nSo, I just put in the back of your mind the why is important, the interest r ates are important, the recession is important. If things stay where \\nthey are today, we have kind of the soft landing that seems to be embedded in the marketplace, everyone will – the real estate will muddle \\nthrough. Obviously, it will be idiosyncratic if you're in different cities and different types and B versus A buildings and all of that, but people \\nmuddle through. They won't muddle through under higher rates with the recession. That would be tough for a lot of folks and n ot just real \\nestate if, in fact , that happens . \\n............................................................................................... ............................................................................................................................. ...... \\nEbrahim H. Poonawala  \\nAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Q \\nHelpful. Thank you so much . \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nThanks, Ebrahim . \\n............................................................................................... ............................................................................................................................. ...... \\n \\nOperator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. You may proceed .  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nErika Najarian  \\nAnalyst, UBS S ecurities LLC  Q \\nHi. Good morning. Given that your response to Betsy's question is that 15% CET1 today prepares you for Basel III Endgame as w ritten, you \\nearn 22% on – without the FDIC assessment. Ahead of Investor Day, I guess, six weeks from now or a week from now, as we think about that \\n17% through -the-cycle target, if you're at the right capital level per you guys, where are you over -earning today ? \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nRight. So, interesting framing of the question, Erika. So, I think we've been pretty consistent about where we're over -earning, right? So, \\nobviously, one major area is that we're over -earning in deposit margin, especially in  consumer and that's sort of why we're expecting \\nsequential declines in NII, why we've talked about compressing deposit margins and increases in weighted average rate paid. S o, I think that's \\nprobably the single biggest source of, let's call it, excess ear nings currently.  \\n \\nYou also have heard Jamie say that we're over -earning in credit. I mean, Wholesale charge -offs have been particularly low, but we have \\nbuilds for that. So, in the current run rate, a bit less clear the extent of what we're earning. And i n Card, of course, while charge -offs are now \\nclose to normalized essentially, we did go through an extended period of charge -offs being very low by historical standards, although that was \\ncoupled with NII also being low by historical standards. So, from a bottom line perspective, it's not entirely clear what the net of that was. But \\nbroadly, it's really deposit margin that's the biggest single factor in the over -earning narrative.  \\n \\nEmbedded in your question, I think, is a little bit of the “what are you thin king about the 17% CET1 in light of the current level of capital ” and so \\non and you did talk about Investor Day. I was hoping that we would have interesting things to say about that at Investor Day in ligh t of potential \\nupdates of the Basel III Endgame , given that the single most important factor for that 17% is how much denominator expansion do we see \\nthrough the Basel III Endgame.  \\n \\nAt the rate we're going, we won't actually know that much more about that by Investor Day, so we might not have that much  more to say \\nexcept to reiterate what I've said in the past which is that, whatever it is, it's going to be very good, our returns in abso lute terms, very good in \\nrelative terms. We will optimize, we will seek to reprice, we will adjust in various ways to the best of our ability. But given the structure of the \\nrule as proposed at least, a lot of this cannot be optimized away. And so, in the base case you have to think of it as a headwi nd. \\n............................................................................................................................. ......................................................................................... ............  \\n \\n10 \\n \\nErika Najarian  \\nAnalyst, UBS Securities LLC  Q \\nGot it. And just as a follow -up question, you mentioned that the current curve that you set your NII outlook upon is stale. I guess, does it matter \\nthat – it seems like the market down  pricing, and obviously no June cut, no September cut a nd a toss -up in December , which should  matter for \\nthis year. As we think about that $90 billion, if we price rate cut s out totally, does that matter much given it seems like June is the only one that \\nwould...  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. Sorry, Erika. So, just quick things on this. One, let's focus on NII ex ., not on total NII. So, I'd anchor you to the $89 billion. Number two, if \\nyou want to do math for like the changes of the average fund s rate for the rest of the year and multiply that times the EaR like, be my guest , \\nit's like as good as an approach as any.  \\n \\nBut I would just once again remind you of the $900 billion of deposits paying practically zero, that very small chang es there can make a big \\ndifference. And we've got other factors. We've got the impact of QT on deposit balances, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So , we want to make \\nsure that we don't get too precise here. We're giving you our best guess based on a series  of assumptions and it's going to be where it's going \\nto be . \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nCha irman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMo rgan Chase & Co . A \\nWhich we know are going to be wrong . \\n............................................................................................... ............................................................................................................................. ...... \\nErika Najarian  \\nAnalyst, UBS S ecurities LLC  Q \\nThan ks. \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\nOperator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. You may proceed. . \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nKen Usdin  \\nAnalyst, Jefferies LLC  Q \\nThanks. Good morning. Jeremy, I was wondering if you could expand a little bit on one of your prepared comments. When you tal ked about,  \\nwe'll have hopes and expectations for the Investment Banking pipeline that continued to move along, we obviously saw the good movement in \\nECM and DCM and the lag in Advisory. Can you just talk about that?  \\n \\nYou mentioned like potential cautiousness around the election. Just what are you hearing from both the corporate side and the sponsor side \\nwith – as it relates to M&A on like go -no-go type of feel and conversation levels? And then, what are you thinking we need to have to kickstart \\njust another good level of IPO activity in the ECM markets? Thanks . \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nSure. Yeah. Let me take the IPO first. So, we have been a little bit cautious there. Some cohorts and vintages of IPOs had pe rformed \\nsomewhat disappointingly. I think that narrative has changed t o a meaningful degree this quarter. So I think we're seeing better IPO \\nperformance. Obviously, Equity Markets have been under a little bit of pressure last few days. But in general, we have a lot of support there \\nand that always helps.  \\n \\nDialogue is quite g ood. A lot of interesting different types of conversations happening with global firms, multinationals, carve -out type things. \\nSo, dialogue is good. Valuation  environment is better , like sort of decent reasons for optimism there. But of course, with ECM,  there's always a \\npipeline dynamic and conditions were particularly  good this quarter. And so, we caution ed a little bit there about pull -forward . Which is even \\nmore acute I think on the DCM side , given that quite a higher percentage of the total amount of debt that needed to be refinanced this year, \\nhas gotten done in the first quarter. So, that's a factor.  \\n \\n \\n11 \\n \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nAnd then, the question of M&A I think is probably the single most important question, not only because of its impact on M&A, but also because \\nof it's knock -on impact on DCM through acquisition, financing and so on. And there is the well -known kind of regulatory headwinds there and \\nthat's definitely having a bit of a chilling effect. I don't kn ow, I've heard some narratives that maybe there is like some pent -up deal demand. \\nWho knows how important politics are in all this? So, I don't know.  \\n \\nWe're fundamentally, as I said, I think  on the press call, happy to see momentum this quarter . Happy t o see momentum in announced M&A. A \\nlittle bit cautious about the pull -forward dynamic . A little bit cautious about the regulatory headwinds. And in the end, we're just going to fight \\nreally hard for our share of the wallet here . \\n............................................................... ............................................................................................................................. ......................................   \\nKen Usdin  \\nAnalyst, Jefferies LLC  Q \\nGot it. And I guess, I'll just stick on the theme of capital markets, and not surprising at all to see a little bit tougher c omp in FIC C. I think you \\nguys have kind of indicated that maybe a flattish fee pool is a reasonable place , and I know that's impossible to guide on. But just, maybe talk \\nto some of the dynamics in terms of activity across the Fixed Income and Equities business. And do you feel like this is the type of \\nenvironment where, given that lingering uncertainty about rates, clients are either more engaged or less engaged in terms of how they're \\npositioning portfolios? Thanks . \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. Really good question. I would say, in general, that the sort of volatility and uncertainty in the rate environment overall on balance is \\nactually supportive for the Market s revenue pool. And I think that , together with generally more balance sheet deployment as well as sort of \\nsome level of natural background  growth , is one of the reasons that the overall level of Markets revenue has stabilized at meaningfully above \\nwhat was normal in the pre -pandemic period.  \\n \\nAnd well, that does occasionally make us a little bit anxious like, “Oh, is this sustainable? Might  there be downside here? ” For now, that does \\nseem to be the new normal. And I do think that having rates off the lower zero bound and a sort of more normal dynamic and gl obal rates, that \\nnot only affects the rates business, but it affects the Foreign Excha nge business. It generally just makes asset allocation decisions more \\nimportant and more interesting.  \\n \\nAnd so, all of that creates risk management needs and active managers need to grapple with it, and so on and so forth. So, I think that – those \\nare some of the themes on the Market side at the margin. And yeah, we'll see how the rest of the year goes. But it sort of seems to be \\nbehaving relatively normally, I would sa y. \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\nOperator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. You may proceed . \\n............................................................................................................................. ............................................................. ........................................  \\nMike Mayo  \\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC  Q \\nHi. Jamie, I'm just trying to reconcile some of your concerns in your CEO letter. I'm sure the 60 pages  – I can see you put a lot of effort into \\nthat, and it's appreciated. But you talked about scenarios, tail risk, macro risk, geopolitical risk and all that over several years, if not weeks or \\nmonths. I get it. On the other hand, the firm is investing so much more outside the U .S., whether it's commercial or some digital banking, \\nconsumer or wholesale payments. So , I'm just trying to reconcile kind of your actions with your words.  \\n \\nAnd specifically, how is global Wholesale Payments going? You mentioned you're in 60 countries. You do business a lot more. How is that \\nbusiness in parti cular doing? Thanks . \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nRight, Mike. So I ’m sorry to tell you that Jamie actually left us because he ’s at a leadership off -site. That ’s why he was here remote. So, I think \\nhe left the call in my hands , for better or for worse. But let me try to address some of your points and without sort of speaking for Jamie here.  \\n \\n \\n12 \\n \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nI think that when we talk about the impact of the geopolitical uncertainty on the outlook, part of the point there is to  note that the U .S. is not \\nisolated from that. If we have  global macroeconomic problems as a result of geopolitical situations, that ’s not only a problem outside of the \\nU.S.; that affects the global economy and therefore the US and therefore our corporate customers, et cetera, et cetera.  \\n \\nAnd in that context, keeping in mind what we always say that we invest through -the-cycle, that we sort of , we don’t  go into countries and then \\nleave countries, et cetera. Obviously, we adjust around the edges, we manage ri sks, we do make choices as a function of the overall \\ngeopolitical environment. But broadly , the notion that we would pull back meaningfully from one of the key competitive strengths that this \\ncompany has always had which is, its sort of global  character because of a particular moment geopolitically, would just be inconsistent with \\nhow we've always operated.  \\n \\nAnd in terms of the Wholesale Payments business, it's going great. We're taking share. There's been a lot of innovation there, a lot of \\ninvestment in technology, a lot of connectivity to payment systems in different countries around the world. And yeah, I'm sur e we'll give you \\nmore color in other settings on that, but it's a good story. It's a nice thing to see . \\n............................................................................................................................. .................................................................................... .................  \\nMike Mayo  \\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC  Q \\nJust as a follow up to that then, why is it doing great in terms of Wholesale Payments, given such the – the dislocations in the world from wars \\nto supply chain changes, everything else? Why is Wholesale Payments doing great ? \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nWell, I think one of the things about Payments business es is that, in some sense they are – I mean, recession proof is probably the wrong \\nword; and in any case, we're not dealing with the rec ession . We're talking fundamentally about moving money through pipes around the world, \\nand that's a thing that people need to do more or less, no matter what. So, that's one piece.  \\n \\nBut I think the other piece is that, our willingness to invest which has always been a focus of yours, is one of the key things separating us in \\nthis business right now. And so, we are seeing the benefits of that . \\n......................................................... ............................................................................................................................. ............................................  \\nMike Mayo  \\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC  Q \\nAlright. Thank you . \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nThanks, Mike . \\n............................................................................................................................. ....................... ..............................................................................  \\n \\nOperator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. You may proceed . \\n............................................................................................................................. ....................................................................................................  \\nGlenn S chorr  \\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI  Q \\nThank you. Your commentary with Ken's questions were great and clear on Investment Banking for the near term in this year. I have a bigger \\npicture question in terms of, you're always so good in spelling out where you're over -earning. Do you feel like you 're under -earning on the \\nInvestment Banking side? And I just use some of your own numbers from the past of like, the market has added like $40 trillion of equity \\nmarket cap and $40 trillion of fixed income market cap last 10 years, yet the wallet is like  20% plus below the 10 -year average. So, is there \\njust a bigger upside and it's just a matter of when, not if . \\n................................................................................................................... ...............................................................................................................  \\n \\n \\n13 \\n \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah, Glenn. In short, yes. I mean, I think we're not shy about saying that we'r e under -earning in Investment Banking right now. Clearly, we're \\nbelow cycle averages, as you point out. We've been talking about when do we get back to the pre -pandemic wallet? But as you know, I mean \\non this point, what it was, like March 2020, right, w as the beginning of the pandemic. So, it's like four years ago at this point. So, there has \\nbeen GDP growth, especially in nominal terms during that period, and you would expect the wallet to growth with that.  \\n \\nSo, I do think there's meaningful upside in t he Investment Banking fee wallet. As I've noted, there are some headwinds , I think particularly in \\nM&A. But over time, you would hope that the amount of M&A is a function of the underlying industrial logic rather than the re gulatory \\nenvironment. So , you could see some mean reversion there. And, yeah, so that's why we're sort of leaning in. We're engaging with clients. \\nWe're making sure that we're appropriately resourced for a more robust level of the wallet and fighting for every dollar of s hare. \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nGlenn S chorr  \\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI  Q \\nCool. Maybe one other follow -up. You're alway s investing. You clearly get paid in growth across the franchise as you do. But relative to a lot of \\nother banks that have been keeping the expenses a lot closer to flat, do you envision environment, or maybe I should rephrase  that, what type \\nof environmen t would have J .P. Morgan pull back on this tremendous investment spending wave that you've been going through ? \\n............................................................................................................................. ............................................................................... ......................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nSure. So, I think the first thing to say which is somewhat obvious but I'm going to say it anyway is that, there are some like auto -governors in \\nthis, right? Like some portion of the expense base is directly related to revenue, whether it's volume -related commissions, whether it's \\nincentive compensation, whether it's other thing s. So, there are some auto -correcting elements of the expense base that would happen \\nautomatically as part of the normal discipline. So, that's point one.  \\n \\nPoint two is that, independently of the environment, we are always looking for efficiencies. It's a little bit hard to see it, and in a world where \\nwe're guiding to, I guess, now with the special assessment  added , $91 billion of expenses , it's hard to tell a story about all the efficiencies that \\nhave been generated underneath. But that is part of the DNA of the company, that does happen in BAU all the time as we grind things out, get \\nthe benefits of scale and try to extract that efficiency.  \\n \\nAnd I think to get to the heart of your question which is, okay, in what type of an environment would we mak e different strategic questions? \\nAnd in the end, I think that's a little bit about what that environment is really like. So, if you talk about like a normal r ecession,  with visibility on \\nthe cycle, would we change our long -term strategic investment plans w hich are always built up from a financial modeling perspective \\nassuming resilience through -the-cycle? No, we wouldn't.  \\n \\nCould there be some environments that for whatever reason change the business case for certain investments , or even certain businesses , \\nthat lead us to make meaningfully different strategic choices? Yes, but that would be because the through -the-cycle analysis has changed for \\nsome reason. I just don't see us fundamentally making strategically different decisions if the strategic outlook is  unchanged, simply because of \\nthe business cycle in the short -term. \\n............................................................................................................................. ............................................................................. ........................  \\nGlenn S chorr  \\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI  Q \\nAwesome. Thank you . \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nThanks . \\n............................................................................................................................. .......................................................................................... ...........  \\n \\nOperator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed . \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\n14 \\n \\nMatt O’Connor  \\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, I nc. Q \\nGood morning. You mentioned one use of capital is to lean into the trading businesses with your balance sheet. And we just se e the trading \\nassets going up Q2, which is probably seasonal, but also up a lot year -over-year, but not necessarily translate into higher revenues. And I \\nknow they don't like match up necessarily each quarter, but maybe just elaborate like how you're leaning into the trad ing with the balance \\nsheet and how you expect that to benefit you over time . \\n............................................................................................................................. ........................................ .............................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah, sure. So, let me break this question down into a couple of different parts. So, I think what Jamie was sort of suggesting is that, you can \\nthink of the concept as kind of like strategic capital versus tactical capital for lack of a better term. And what he's kind of saying is that, in a \\nmoment where you're carrying a lot of excess capital sort of for strate gic reasons, you have the ability at least in theory to deploy portions of \\nthat with kind of like – into relatively short -duration assets or strategies or client opportunities in whatever moment for whatever reason, and \\nwhat might be thought of as a tactic al sense.  \\n \\nSo, he's just pointing out that that's an option that you have. And the extent to which this quarter's increase in Markets RW A is a reflection of \\nthat, maybe a little bit, but probably not. I agree with you that it's hard in any given quarter to specifically link the change in capital and RWA to \\na change in revenue versus too many moving parts there.  \\n \\nBut for sure, one thing that's true is the higher run rate of the Markets businesses as a whole that we talked about a second  ago, is lin ked also \\nto higher deployment of balance sheet into those businesses. So, as you well know, we pride ourselves on being extremely anal ytical and \\nextremely disciplined in how we analyze capital liquidity, balance sheet deployment, G SIB capacity utilization , et cetera, in the Markets \\nbusiness. And we don't just chase revenue; we go after returns fully measured. And that's part of the DNA, and we continue to  do it and we \\nwill. \\n \\nSo – that we still are operating under multiple binding constraints. And obviousl y, the environment is complex, so the ability to sort of throw a \\nton of capital at opportunities is not quite that simple always. But big picture, we are clearly in a very, very strong capit al position which is, in \\nno small part in anticipation of all the uncertainty, but it does also mean that if opportunities arise between now and when the Basel III \\nEndgame is final, we are very well positioned to take advantage of those opportunities . \\n............................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................................  \\nMatt O’Connor  \\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, I nc. Q \\nGot it. An d then just separately, within the Consumer Card businesses, you highlighted volumes were up 9% year -over-year. Obviously, still a \\nvery strong piece. Any trends within that that are worth noting in terms of changes in spend category ? Either overall or amo ng certain \\nsegments? Thank you . \\n............................................................................................................................. .................................................................................... .................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nMaybe a little bit. Jamie already alluded somewhat to this. So, I do think spend is fine but not boomy, broadly speaking, I w ould say. You can \\nlook at it a lot of different ways: inflation, cohorts, et cetera. But when you kind of triangulate that, you get  back to this kind of flattish picture. \\nThere is a little bit of evidence of substituting out of discretionary into nondiscretionary.  \\n \\nAnd I think the single most notable thing is just this effect, where in the – while it is true that real incomes have gon e up in the lowest income \\ncohorts, within that there's obviously a probability distribution. And there's some – or rather just a distribution of outcomes. And there are some \\nset of people whose real incomes are not up, they're down, and who are therefore s truggling a little bit unfortunately. And what you observe in \\nthe spending patterns of those people is, some meaningful slowing rather than what you might have feared which is sort of agg ressive levering \\nup. \\n \\nSo, I think that's maybe an economic indicator of sorts, although this portion of the population is small enough that I'm not sure the reader cost \\nis that big. But it is encouraging from a credit perspective because it just means that people are behaving kind of rationall y and in a sort of \\nnormal post -pandemic type of way as they manage their own balance sheets, and that's sort of the margin good news from a credit \\nperspective . \\n............................................................................................................................. .................................................................................................. ... \\n \\n15 \\n \\nMatt O’Connor  \\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, I nc. Q \\nOkay. That's helpful. Thank you very much . \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nThanks . \\n............................................................................................................................. .......................................................................................... ...........  \\n \\nOperator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed . \\n............................................................................................................................. ....................................................................................................  \\nGerard Cassidy  \\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC  Q \\nHi, Jeremy . \\n............................................................................................................................. ..................................................................... ................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nHey, Gerard. How are you doing ? \\n............................................................................................................................. ......................................... ............................................................  \\nGerard Cassidy  \\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC  Q \\nGood. Thanks. Notwithstanding your guys' outlook for uncertainty, and of course Jamie talked about it in his shareholder letter and addressed \\nit also on this call when he was here earlier. Can you guys share or can you share with us the color on what's going on in th e corporate \\nlending market in terms of spreads seem to be getting tighter ? It's not reflecting, I don't think, a real fear out there in the global geopolitical \\nworld. And any color just on what you guys are seeing in the leveraged loan market as well ? \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nRight. So, I think what's true about spreads in general, just broadly credit spreads including secondary markets and to some extent the \\nleverage lending space, is that they are exceptionally tight. So, I'm sure that's reversed a little bit in the last few days.  But bro adly throughout \\nthe quarter, we've really seen credit spreads tighten quite a bit. You even see that a little bit in our OCI this quarter, wh ere losses in OCI that \\nwe would've had from higher rates have been meaningfully offset by tighter credit spreads in  the portfolio. So broadly, sort of in keeping with \\nthe big run -up that we saw in equity markets and the general sort of bullish tone, you saw quite a bit of credit spread tightening in secondary \\nmarkets.  \\n \\nThat, I think, has manifested itself a little bi t in the leverage lending space in the normal way that it does, and that there's a lot of competition \\namong providers for the revenue pool, and you start to see a little bit of loosening of terms which always makes us a little bit concerned. And \\nas we have  in the past, we are going to be very well prepared to lose share in that space if we don't like the terms. We never compromis e on \\nstructure there. So, you are seeing a little bit of that.  \\n \\nI think that, away from the leverage lending space in the broader C&I space, there was a moment a few months ago where I thin k, in no small \\npart, as a result of banks generally anticipating this more challenging capital environment and sort of disc iplining a little bit their lending, you're \\nseeing a little bit of widening actually in those corporate lending spreads. I don't know if that trend has like survived ove r the last few weeks, \\nand  it was little bit hard to observe in any case . \\n \\nBut I would say broadly, the dynamics are the tension between people trying to be careful with their balance sheets and the f act that overall \\nasset prices and conditions are quite supportive and secondary market credit spreads have rallied a lot . \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\n \\n \\n16 \\n \\nGerard Cassidy  \\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC  Q \\nThank you. And I guess, as a tie -in to that question  and answer, we've read and seen so much about the private credit growth in this country \\nby private credit companies. Can you give us some color on what yo u're seeing there, both as a competitor , but also as a client of JPMorgan? \\nHow you balance the two out, where you may see them bidding on business that you'd like but at the same time you're supportin g their \\nbusiness?  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nRight. Yeah. I mean, I think that tension between us as a provider of secured financing to some portions of the private credi t, private equity \\ncommunity, you're talking about different parts of the capital structu re. But we do recognize that we compete in some areas and we are clients \\nof each other in other areas, and that's part of the franchise and it's all good at some level.  \\n \\nBut narrowly, on private credit, it is interesting to observe what's going on there. S o I would say, for us, the strategy there is very much to be \\nproduct agnostic actually. It's not so much like, oh, is it private credit or is it syndicated lending? It's, what does it take to be good at this stuff? \\nAnd what it takes is, stuff that we h ave and have always had and that we're very good at in each individual silo . So, you need underwriting \\nskill, structuring skill, origination, distribution, secondary trading, risk appetite, credit analysis capabilities. And this  is what we do and we're \\nreally good at it.  \\n \\nAnd increasingly, what you see actually is that, as you see us doing a little bit, as the private credit space gets bigger, i t starts to make sense \\nto actually bring in some co -lenders so that you can sort of do big enough deals without having undue concentration risks. I mean, even if you \\nhave the capital, you just may not want the concentration risk.  \\n \\nAnd so, in a funny way, the private credit space becomes a little bit more like the syndicated lending space. And at the same  time, the \\nsyndicated lending space being influenced a little bit by these private credit uni tranche structures, gets pushed a little bit in the private credit \\ndirection in terms of like speed of execution and other aspects of how that business works. So, we'r e watching it. The competitive dynamics \\nare interesting. Certainly, there's some pressure in some areas. But we really do think that our overall value proposition an d competitive \\nposition here is second to none, and so we're looking forward to the future h ere. \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nGerard Cassidy  \\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC  Q \\nAppreciate the color. Thank you.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nThanks, Gerard . \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\nOperator:  Thank you. Our last question comes from Charles Peabody with Portales. Your line is open . \\n............................................................................................................................. ..................................................................................... ................  \\nCharles W. Peabo dy \\nAnalyst, Portales Partners LLC  Q \\nGood morning. A couple of questions on the First Republic acquisition. Some of us obviously thought that would be a homerun, and I'm glad to \\nsee that Jamie Di mon validated that in his annual letter. When you look at the first quarter, it annualizes out to $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion,  above \\nthe $2 billion that Jamie published in the letter. I know you don't want to extrapolate that.  \\n \\nBut can you remind us what so rt of cost savings you still have in that, because this quarter did see expenses come down to $800 million down \\nfrom $900 million? And then, secondly, is there an offset to that where the accretion becomes less and less and that's why yo u don't want to \\nextrapolate the $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion? So, that's my first question . \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\n \\n17 \\n \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nOkay. Thanks, Charlie. And I'm going to do my best to answer your question, while sticking to my sort of guns  on not giving too much First \\nRepublic  specific guidance. But I do think that the kind of framework you're articulating is broadly correct. So, let me go through th e pieces.  \\n \\nSo yes, the current quarter's results annualized to more than the $2 billion Jamie talked about. Yes, a big part of that reason is discount \\naccretion which was very frontloaded as a result of short -dated assets. So, that's part of the reason that you see that converge. Yes, it's also \\ntrue that we expect the expense run rate  to decline later in the year as we continue making progress on integration. Obviously, as I think as I \\nmentioned to you last quarter, from a full year perspective you just have the offset of the full year calendarization effect.  \\n \\nThere's maybe an embedded  question in there, too, about we had talked about $2.5 billion of integration expense. And the integration is real, \\nthe expenses are real, and also the time spent on that is quite real. It's a lot of work for a lot of people. It's going well , but we're no t done yet; \\nand it takes a lot of effort. But broadly, I think that our expectations for integration expense are probably coming in a bit  lower than we \\noriginally assumed on the morning of the deal, for a couple of reasons.  \\n \\nOne is that the framework aroun d the time was understandably quite conservative and sort of assumes that we would kind of lose a \\nmeaningful portion of the franchise, and would sort of need to size the expense base accordingly. And of course, it's worked out, to your poin t, \\nquite a bit better than that. And therefore, the amount of expenses that is necessary to keep this bigger franchise is higher . And that means, \\nless integration expense associated with taking down those numbers.  \\n \\nIt's probably also true that the integrat ion assumptions were conservative. They were based on kind of more typical type of bank M&A \\nassumptions as opposed to the particular nature of this deal including the FDIC and so on and so forth. So, yeah, I think tha t probably is a \\npretty complete answer to your question. Thanks, Charlie . \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nCharles W. Peabo dy \\nAnalyst, Portales Partners LLC  Q \\nAs a quick follow -up. Where are the next homeruns going to come from? And this is more strategic beyond just JPMorgan, but there are \\nprobably going to be more regional bank failures, whether it's this year or next year, and opportunities to pick those up. But what you're seei ng \\nis that, private equity and family offices are setting up to participate in this next round of bank failures. Mnuchin's buyin g of NYCB is clearly to \\ncreate a platform for rollups of failed banks, and then there are other family offices that have filed shelf registrations fo r bank holding \\ncompanies whose specific purpose is to buy failed banks.  \\n \\nSo, do you think that these opportuni ties are going to be competed away by private credit? And as part of that, do you think the regulators are \\ngoing to view private credit as a different party and less attractive party versus bank takeovers of failed banks? So, that's  my question . \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nRight. Okay, Charlie. There's a lot in there. And to be honest, I just don't love the idea of spending a lot of time on this call speculating about \\nbank failures. You obviously have a particular view about the next wave in the landscape. I'm not going to bother debating that with you. But I \\nguess, let me just try to say a couple of things, doing my best to answer your question.  \\n \\nAs we talked about earlier, we have a lot of capital. And as Jamie says, the capital is earnings in store, and right now we don't see a lot of \\nreally compelling opportunities to deploy the capital. But if opportunities arise despite the uncertainty about the Basel III  Endgame, we will be \\nwell positioned to deploy it. I think embedded there is also sort of a question about the FDIC and the FDIC's attitude towards dif ferent types of \\nbidders, and obviously there's a lot of thinking and analysis happening about the entire process and some recent fo rums and speeches on \\nbank resolution and so on and so forth.  \\n \\nAnd I think probably we can all agree that it's better, all else equal for the system, to have as much capital available and as many different \\ntypes of capital available to ensure that things ar e stabilized if anything ever goes wrong. But the mechanics of how you do that when you're \\ntalking about banks are not trivial and not to be underestimated. So I guess, that's probably as much as I have on that . \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nCharles W.

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. This call is being \\nrecorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. The presentation is available on \\nJPMorgan Chase's web site, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward -looking statements. Please standby.  \\n \\nAt this time I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, pleas e go ahead.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  \\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $18.1 billion, EPS of $6.12 on rev enue of $51 \\nbillion, with an ROTCE of 28%. These results included the $ 7.9 billion net gain related to Visa shares and the $1 billion Foundation \\ncontribution of the appreciated Visa stock. Also included is $546 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate. E xcluding these \\nitems, the Firm had net income of $13.1 bi llion, EPS of $4.40, and an ROTCE of 20%.  \\n \\nTouching on a couple of highlights. In the CIB, IB fees were up 50% year -on-year and 17% quarter -on-quarter, and Markets revenue was up \\n10% year -on-year. In CCB, we had a record number of first -time investors and strong customer acquisition across checking accounts and \\nCard, and we've continued to see strong net inflows across AWM.  \\n \\nNow, before I give more detail on the results, I just want to mention that starting this quarter we are no longer explicitly calling o ut the First \\nRepublic contribution in the presentation. Going forward, we'll only specifically call it out if it is a meaningful driver in  the year -on-year \\ncomparison. As a reminder, we acquired First Republic in May of last year, so the prior -year quarter  only has two months of First Republic \\nresults compared to the full three months this quarter. Also, in the prior -year quarter, most of the expenses were in Corporate, whereas now \\nthey are primarily in the relevant line of business.  \\n \\nNow, turning to page 2  for the Firmwide results. The Firm reported revenue of $51 billion, up $8.6 billion or 20% year -on-year. Excluding both \\nthe Visa gain that I mentioned earlier, as well as last year's First Republic bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion, revenue of $43.1 b illion was \\nup $3.4 billion or 9%. NII ex. Markets was up $568 million or 3%, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates,  higher revolving \\nbalances in Card, and the additional month of First Republic -related NII, partially offset by deposit margin compression and lower deposit \\nbalances.  \\n \\nNIR ex. Markets was up $7.3 billion or 56%. Excluding the items I just mentioned, it was up $2.1 billion or 21%, largely driv en by higher \\nInvestment Banking revenue and Asset Management fees. Both periods inc luded net investment securities losses. And Markets revenue was \\nup $731 million or 10% year -on-year. Expenses of $23.7 billion were up $2.9 billion or 14% year -on-year. Excluding the Foundation \\ncontribution I previously mentioned, expenses were up 9%, prim arily driven by compensation, including revenue -related compensation and \\ngrowth in employees. And credit costs were $3.1 billion, reflecting net charge -offs of $2.2 billion and a net reserve build of $821 million. Net \\ncharge -offs were up $820 million year -on-year, predominantly driven by Card. The net reserve build included $609 million in Consumer and \\n$189 million in Wholesale.  \\n \\nOn to balance sheet and capital on page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15.3%, up 30 basis points versus the pri or quarter, \\nprimarily driven by net income, largely offset by capital distributions and higher RWA. As you know, we completed CCAR a coup le of weeks \\nago and have already disclosed a number of the key points. Let me summarize them again here. Our preliminary SC B is 3.3%, although the \\nfinal SCB could be higher. The preliminary SCB, which is up from the current requirement of 2.9%, results in a 12.3% standard ized CET1 ratio \\nrequirement, which goes into effect in the fourth quarter of 2024. And finally, the Firm an nounced that the board intends to increase the \\nquarterly common stock dividend from $1.15 to $1.25 per share in the third quarter of 2024.  \\n \\nNow, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 4. CCB reported net income of $4.2 billion on revenue of $17.7 billion, which was \\nup 3% year -on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was down 5% year -on-year, reflecting lower deposits and deposit margin \\ncompression, partially offset by growth in Wealth Management revenue. Average deposits were down 7% year-on-year and 1% quarter -on-\\nquarter. Client investment assets were up 14% year -on-year, predominantly driven by market performance. In Home Lending, revenue of $1.3 \\nbillion was up 31% year -on-year, predominantly driven by higher NII, including one addit ional month of the First Republic portfolio.  \\n \\nTurning to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 14% year -on-year, predominantly driven by higher Card NII on higher revolving balances. \\nCard outstandings were up 12% due to strong account acquisition and the co ntinued normalization of revolve. And in Auto, originations were \\n$10.8 billion, down 10% coming off strong originations from a year ago, while continuing to maintain healthy margins. Expense s of $9.4 billion \\nwere up 13% year -on-year, predominantly driven b y First Republic expenses now reflected in the lines of business, as I mentioned earlier, as \\nwell as field compensation and continued growth in technology and marketing.  \\n \\n3 \\n \\n \\nIn terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $2.6 billion, reflecti ng net charge -offs of $2.1 billion, up $813 million year -on-year, \\npredominantly driven by Card, as newer vintages season and credit normalization continues. The net reserve build was $579 mil lion, also \\ndriven by Card due to loan growth and updates to certa in macroeconomic variables.  \\n \\nNext, the Commercial & Investment Bank on page 5. Our new Commercial & Investment Bank reported net income of $5.9 billion on  revenue \\nof $17.9 billion. You'll note that we are disclosing revenue by business as well as breaking down the Banking & Payments revenue by client \\ncoverage segment in order to best highlight the relevant trends in both important dimensions of the Wholesale franchise. This  quarter, IB fees \\nwere up 50% year -on-year, and we ranked number one with year -to-date wallet share of 9.5%. In Advisory, fees were up 45%, primarily driven \\nby the closing of a few large deals and a weak prior -year quarter. Underwriting fees were up meaningfully, with Equity up 56% and Debt up \\n51%, benefiting from favorable market conditio ns. \\n \\nIn terms of the outlook, we're pleased with both the year -on-year and sequential improvement in the quarter. We remain cautiously optimistic \\nabout the pipeline, although many of the same headwinds are still in effect. It's also worth noting that pull -forward refinancing activity was a \\nmeaningful contributor to the strong performance in the first half of the year.  \\n \\nPayments revenue was $4.5 billion, down 4% year -on-year, as deposit margin compression and higher deposit -related client credits were \\nlargel y offset by fee growth. Moving to Markets, total revenue was $7.8 billion, up 10% year -on-year. Fixed Income was up 5%, with continued \\nstrength in Securitized Products. And Equity Markets was up 21%, with equity derivatives up on improved client activity, and we saw record \\nrevenue in Prime and growth in client balances amid supportive equity market levels. Security Services revenue of $1.3 billio n was up 3% \\nyear-on-year, driven by higher volumes and market levels, largely offset by deposit margin compressio n. Expenses of $9.2 billion were up \\n12% year -on-year, largely driven by higher revenue -related compensation, legal expense, and volume -related non -compensation expense.  \\n \\nIn Banking & Payments, average loans were up 2% year -on-year due to the impact of the First Republic acquisition and flat sequentially. \\nDemand for new loans remains muted as middle market and large corporate clients remain somewhat cautious due to the economic \\nenvironment, and revolver utilization continues to be below pre -pandemic levels. Also, capital markets are open and are providing an \\nalternative to traditional bank lending for these clients. In CRE, higher rates continue to suppress both loan origination an d pay -off activity. \\nAverage client deposits were up 2% year -on-year and relativ ely flat sequentially. Finally, credit costs were $384 million. The net reserve build \\nof $220 million was primarily driven by incorporating the First Republic portfolio in the Firm's modeled approach. Net charge -offs were $164 \\nmillion, of which about half was in Office.  \\n \\nThen, to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 6. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.3 billion, with p re-tax \\nmargin of 32%. Revenue of $5.3 billion was up 6% year -on-year, driven by growth in management fees on higher average market levels and \\nstrong net inflows, as well as higher brokerage activity, largely offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $3.5 bill ion were up 12% \\nyear-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, primarily revenue -related compensation and continue d growth in our private banking \\nadvisor teams. For the quarter, long -term net inflows were $52 billion, led by Equities and Fixed Income. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of \\n$16 billion. AUM of $3.7 trillion was up 15% year -on-year, and client assets o f $5.4 trillion were up 18% year -on-year, driven by higher market \\nlevels and continued net inflows. And finally, loans and deposits were both flat quarter -on-quarter.  \\n \\nTurning to Corporate on page 7, Corporate reported net income of $6.8 billion on revenue  of $10.1 billion. Excluding this quarter's Visa -related \\ngain and the First Republic bargain purchase gain in the prior year, NIR was up approximately $450 million year -on-year. NII was up $626 \\nmillion year -on-year, driven by the impact of balance sheet mi x and higher rates. Expenses of $1.6 billion were up $427 million year -on-year. \\nExcluding Foundation contribution, expenses were down $573 million year -on-year, largely as a result of moving First Republic -related \\nexpense out of Corporate into the relevant  segments.  \\n \\nTo finish up, we have the outlook on page 8. Our 2024 guidance including the drivers remains unchanged from what we said at In vestor Day. \\nWe continue to expect NII and NII ex. Markets of approximately $91 billion, adjusted expense of about $92 billion, and on credit, Card net \\ncharge -off rate of approximately 3.4%.  \\n \\nSo, to wrap up, the reported performance for the quarter was exceptional and actually represents record revenue and net incom e, or more \\nimportantly, after excluding the significant it ems, the underlying performance continues to be quite strong. And, as always, we remain focused \\non continuing to execute with discipline.  \\n \\nAnd with that, let's open the line for Q&A.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\n \\nQUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION  \\n  \\nOperator : Please standby. For our first question, we'll go to the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.    \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\n \\n4 \\n \\nSteven Chubak  \\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research LLC  Q \\nHi. Good morning, Jeremy.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.   A \\nGood morning, Steve.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nSteven Chubak  \\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research LLC  Q \\nSo, wanted to start off with a question on capital just given some indications that the Fed is considering favorable revision s to both Basel III \\nEndgame and the GSIB surcharge calculations, which I know you've been pushing for some time. As you evaluate just different capital \\nscenarios, are these revisions material enough where they could support a higher normalized ROTCE at the Firm versus the 17% target? And \\nif so, just how that might impact or inf orm your appetite for buybacks going forward?  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nRight. Okay. Thanks, Steve. And actually, before answering the question, I just want to remind everyone that Jamie is not abl e to join because \\nhe has a travel conflict overseas, so it's just going to be me today.  \\n \\nOkay. Good question on the capital and the ROTCE. So, let me start with the ROTCE point first. In short, my answer to that qu estion would be \\nno. It's hard to imagine a scenario coming out of the whole potential range of outcomes on capital that involves an  upward revision on ROTCE. \\nIf you think about the way we've been talking about this, we've said that before the Basel III Endgame proposal, we had a 17%  through the \\ncycle target, and that while you can imagine a range of different outcomes, the vast majori ty of them involve expansions of the denominator. \\nAnd while we had ideas about changing the perimeter and repricing, all of which are still sort of in effect, most of those wo uld be thought of as \\nmitigants rather than things that would actually, like incre ase the ROTCE. And I don't really think that answer has particularly changed.  \\n \\nSo, as of now, that's what I would say, which is a good pivot to the next point, which is, yeah, we've been reading the same press coverage \\nyou've been reading and it's fun and interesting to speculate about the potential outcomes here. But in reality, we don't know anything you \\ndon't know. We don't know how reliable the press coverage is. And so, in that sense, I feel like on the overall capital retur n and buyback \\ntrajectory, no t much has actually changed relative to what I laid out at Investor Day, the comments that I made then, the comments that Jam ie \\nmade then, as well as the comments that Jamie made the subsequent week at an industry conference.  \\n \\nSo, maybe I'll just briefly s ummarize for everyone's benefit what we think that is, which is, one, we do recognize that our current practice on \\ncapital return and buybacks does lead to an ever -expanding CET1 ratio. But obviously, we're going to run the company over the cycle over \\ntime at a reasonable CET1 ratio with reasonable buffers relative to our requirement. So, after all the uncertainty is sorted out, the question of \\nthe deployment of the capital, one way or another, is a matter of when, not if.  \\n \\nOn the capital hierarchy, it's al so worth noting that's another thing that remains unchanged, so I'll review it quickly. Growing the business \\norganically and inorganically, sustainable dividend, and in that context it's worth noting that the board's announced intenti on to increase it to \\n$1.25 is a 19% increase prior to last year. So, that's a testament to our performance and that is a return of capital.  \\n \\nAnd then, finally buybacks. But that hierarchy does not commit us to return 100% of the capital generation in any given quart er. And so, as we \\nsit here today, when you look at the relationship between the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital and the opportuni ties to deploy the \\ncapital outside the Firm, it's kind of hard to imagine an environment where that relationship argues more strongly for patience. So, given all \\nthat, putting it all together, and sorry for the long answer, we remain comfortable with the current amount of excess capital . And as Jamie has \\nsaid, we really continue to think about it as earnings in store as much as anything else.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nSteven Chubak  \\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research LLC  Q \\nNo need to apologize, Jeremy. That was a really helpful  perspective. Maybe just for my follow -up on NII, you've been very consistent just in \\nflagging the risk related to NII overearning, especially in light of potential deposit attrition as well as repricing headwin ds. In the second \\nquarter, we did see at leas t some moderation in repricing pressures, deposit balances were also more resilient in with a seasonally weak  \\n \\n5 \\n \\nSteven Chubak  \\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research LLC  Q \\nquarter for deposit growth. So, just given the evidence that some deposit pressures appear to be abating, do you see the pote ntial for NII \\nnormali zing higher? And where do you think that level could ultimately be in terms of stabilization?  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.   A \\nYeah. Interesting question, Steve. So, let's talk about deposit balances. So, yeah, I see your point about how balance pressu res are slightly \\nabating. When you look at the system as a whole, just to go through it, QT is still a bit of a headwind, loan grow th is modest and not enough to \\noffset that. And our PE seems to have settled in roughly at its current levels, and there are reasons to believe that it migh t not go down that \\nmuch more, although that could always change and that could supply extra reserves  into the system. But on balance net across all those \\nvarious effects, we still think that there are net headwinds to deposit balances. So, when we think of our balance outlook, w e see it as flat to \\nslightly down maybe with our sort of market share and gro wth ambitions offsetting those system -wide headwinds.  \\n \\nSo, in terms of normalizing higher, I guess it depends on relative to what, but I think it's definitely too early to be sort of calling the end of the \\noverearning narrative or the normalization narrati ve. Clearly, the main difference in our current guidance relative to what we had earlier in the \\nyear, which implied a lot more sequential decline, is just the change in the Fed outlook. So, two cuts versus six cuts is the  main difference \\nthere. But obvious ly, based on the latest inflation data and so on, you could easily get back to a situation with a lot more cuts in the yield \\ncurve. So, we'll see how it goes and in the end, we're kind of focused on, on just running the place, recognizing, and trying  not to be distracted \\nby what remains some amount of overearning, whatever it is.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nSteven Chubak  \\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research LLC   Q \\nUnderstood, Jeremy. Thanks so much for taking my questions.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.   A \\nThanks, Steve.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\n \\nOperator:  Next, we'll go to the line of Saul Martinez from HSBC. Please go ahead.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nSaul Martinez  \\nAnalyst, HSBC Securities (USA), Inc  Q \\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Jeremy, can you give an update on the stress capital buffer? You noted obviously that you \\nthink there is an error in the Fed's calculation due to OCI. Can you just give us a sense of what the dialogue with the Fed l ooks like? Is there a \\nprocess to modify the SCB higher and if you could give us a sens e of what that process looks like?  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. So, I'm not going to comment about any conversations with the Fed – not to confirm or deny that they even exist. That stuff is private. \\nAnd so, then if you talk about, like the timing here, right, so you know that the stress capital buffer that's bee n released at 3.3% is a preliminary \\nnumber. By rule, the Fed has to release that by August 31. It may come sooner. You talked about an error in the calculation. We haven't used \\nthat word. What we know, what we believe rather is that the amount of OCI gain that came through the Fed's disclosed results looked non -\\nintuitively high to us. And if you adjust that in ways that we think are reasonable, you would get a slightly higher stress c apital buffer. Whether \\nthe Fed agrees and whether they decide to make that  change or not is up to them, and we'll see what happens.  \\n \\nI think the larger point is that if you look at the industry as a whole and if you sort of put us into that with some higher pro forma’d SCB, \\nwhatever it might suitably be, you actually see once ag ain quite a bit of volatility in the year -on-year change in the stress capital buffer for \\nmany firms. And just sort of reiterating and another example of what we've said a lot over the years that it's volatile, it's  untransparent, it makes \\nit very hard to manage capital of a bank. It leads to excessively high management buffers, and we think it's really not a great way to do thi ngs. \\nSo, I'll leave it at that.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\n \\n6 \\n \\nSaul Martinez  \\nAnalyst, HSBC Securities (USA), Inc  Q \\nOkay, got it. That's helpful. Just following up on capital returns on Steve's question, I think you highlighted in response it's a matter of when, \\nnot if, and obviously, Jamie’s not there, you can’t speak for Jamie, but seems to have shown limited enthusiasm for a special  dividend or \\nbuybac ks at current valuations. Can you just give us a sense of how you’re thinking about the various options? Any updated thoughts  on a \\nspecial dividend? And can you do other things like, for example, have a material increase in your dividend payout, sort of a step function \\nincrease, where keep that flat and grow into that, grow your earnings into that over time? Can you just maybe give us a sense  of how you're \\nthinking about what options you have available to deploy that capital?  \\n............................... ............................................................................................................................. ......................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. A \\nSure. Yeah. I mean, I would direct you to read, I'm sure you have, Jamie's comments at the industry conference, where he part icipated the \\nweek after Investor Day because he went into just good amount of detail on this stuff, addressing some of these points. And I think this \\ncomment there about the special dividend was that it's not really our preference. We hear from people that many of our invest ors wouldn't find \\nthat particularly appealing, and he said as much that it wouldn't be sort of our f irst choice.  \\n \\nSo, I think the larger point is just that, a little bit to your question, there are a number of tools in the toolkit and they 're really the same tools that \\nare part of our capital hierarchy. So, first and foremost, we're looking to deploy the  capital into organic or inorganic growth. And then, the \\ndividend, I think we're always going to want to keep it in that sort of, like sustainable and also sustainable in a stressed environment so that \\ncontinues to be the way we think about that. And then,  at the end of it, it's buybacks and Jamie's been on the record for over a decade, I think, \\nover many shareholder letters, talking about how he thinks about price and buybacks and valuation and price is a factor. So, that's sort of the \\ntotality of the set of options, I guess.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nSaul Mar tinez  \\nAnalyst, HSBC Securities (USA), Inc  Q \\nOkay, great. Thanks a lot.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nThanks, Saul.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\nOperator:  Next, we'll go to the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Please go ahead.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ............................................................................ .........................   \\nKen Usdin  \\nAnalyst, Jefferies LLC  Q \\nThanks a lot. Good morning, Jeremy. Jeremy, great to see the progress on Investment Banking fees up sequentially and 50% year -over-year, \\nand I saw you on the tape earlier just talking about still regulatory concerns a little bit in the advisory space and we clearly didn't see the debt \\npull-forward play through because your DCM was great again. I'm just wondering just where you feel the environment is relative to the \\npotential and just w here the dialogue is across the three main bucket areas in terms of, like how does this feel in terms of a current \\nenvironment versus a potential environment that we could still see ahead. Thanks.  \\n........................................................... ............................................................................................................................. ..........................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. Thanks, Ken. It's p rogress, right? I mean, we're happy to see the progress. People have been talking about depressed banking fee \\nwallet for some time and it's nice to see not only the year -on-year pop from a low base, but also a nice sequential improvement. So, that's the \\nfirst thing to say.  \\n \\nIn terms of dialog and engagement, it's definitely elevated . So, the dialog on ECM is elevated, and the dialog on M&A is quite robust as well. \\nSo, all of those are good things that encourage us and make us hopeful that we could be seeing sort of a better trend in this  space. But there \\nare some important caveats. S o, on the DCM side, yeah, we made pull -forward comments in the first quarter, but we still feel that this second \\nquarter still reflects a bunch of pull -forward and therefore, we're reasonably cautious about the second half of the year. Importantly, a lot o f the \\nactivity is refinancing activity as opposed to, for example, acquisition finance. So, the fact that M&A remains still relativ ely muted in terms of  \\n \\n7 \\n \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nactual deals has knock -on effects on DCM as well. And when a higher percentage of the wallet is refied,  then the pull -forward risk becomes a \\nlittle bit higher.  \\n \\nOn ECM, if you look at it kind of at a remove, you might ask the question, given the performance of the overall indices, you would think it \\nwould be a really booming environment for IPOs for example . And while it's improving, it's not quite as good as you would otherwise expect, \\nand that's driven by a variety of factors, including the fact that, as has been widely discussed, the extent to which the per formance of the large \\nindices is driven by, like a few stocks, the sort of mid -cap tech growth space and other spaces that would typically be driving IPOs have had \\nmuch more muted performance.  \\n \\nAlso, a lot of the private capital that was raised a couple years ago was raised at pretty high valuations. And  so, in some cases, people looking \\nat IPOs could be looking at down -rounds, that's an issue. And while secondary market performance of IPOs has improved meaningfully, in \\nsome cases people still have concerns about that. So, those are a little bit of overha ng on that space. I think we can hope that over time that \\nfades away and the trend gets a bit more robust. And, yeah, on the advisory side, the regulatory overhang is there, remains t here, and so, \\nwe'll just have to see how that plays out.  \\n................ ............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................  \\nKen Usdin  \\nAnalyst, Jefferies LLC   Q \\nGreat. T hank you for all that, Jeremy. And just one on the Consumer side, just anything you're noticing in terms of people just have been \\nwaiting for this delinquency stabilization on the Credit Card side. Obviously, your loss rates are coming in as you expected,  and we did see 30 \\ndays pretty flat and 90 days come down a little bit. Is that seasonal? Is it just a good rate of change trend? Any thoughts t here? Thanks.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. I still feel like when it comes to Card charge -offs and delinquencies, there's just not much to see there. It's still – it's normalization, not \\ndeterioration. It's in line with expectations. As I say, we alw ays look quite closely inside the cohort, inside the income cohorts. And when you \\nlook in there, specifically, for example, on spend patterns, you can see a little bit of evidence of behavior that's consiste nt with a little bit of \\nweakness in the lower inc ome segments where you see a little bit of rotation on the spend out of discretionary into non -discretionary.  \\n \\nBut the effects are really quite subtle and in my mind definitely entirely consistent with the type of economic environment t hat we're seeing, \\nwhich while very strong and certainly a lot stronger than anyone would have thought given the tightness of monetary conditions,  say, like \\nthey've been predicting it a couple of years ago or whatever, you are seeing slightly higher unemployment, you are seein g moderating GDP \\ngrowth. And so, it's not entirely surprising that you're seeing a tiny bit of weakness in some pockets of spend. So, it all k ind of hangs together \\nin what is in some sense actually not a very interesting story.   \\n........................... ............................................................................................................................. ..........................................................................  \\nKen Usdin  \\nAnalyst, Jefferies LLC   Q \\nThank you.  \\n........ ............................................................................................................................. ............................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nThank s, Ken.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\nOperator:  Next, we'll go to the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ...................................................................... ...............................  \\nGlenn Schorr  \\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI  Q \\nHi, thanks very much. So, Jeremy, the discussions so far around private credit and you all, your recent comments have been th e ability to add \\non balance sheet and compete when you need to compete on the private credit front. And I do think that most of the discussion has been \\nabout the direct lending component. So, I'm curious if you're showing more progress and activity on that front. And then, ver y importantly, do  \\n \\n8 \\n \\nGlenn Schorr  \\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI  Q \\nyou see the same  trend happening on the asset -backed finance side because that's a bigger part of the world and it's a bigger part of your \\nbusiness? So, I'd appreciate your thoughts there. Thanks.  \\n........................................................................... ............................................................................................................................. ..........................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. Thanks, Glenn. So, on private credit, so nothing really new to say there. I think, I guess, one way the environment's e volving a little bit \\nis, as you know, a lot of money has been raised in private credit funds looking for deals. And sort of a littl e bit to my prior comment, in a \\nrelatively muted acquisition finance environment, at this point you've got a lot of money chasing, like not that many deals. So, the space is a \\nlittle bit quieter than it was at the margin.  \\n \\nAnother interesting thing to note  is some of this discussion about kind of lender protections that were typical in the syndicated leveraged \\nfinance market making their way into the private market as well as sort of people realize that even in the private market you  probably need \\nsome of t hose protections in some cases, which is sort of supportive of the theme that we've been talking about, about convergence bet ween \\nthe direct lending space and the syndicated lending space, which is kind of our core thesis here, which is that we can offer best-in-class \\nservice across the entire continuum, including secondary market trading and so on. So, we feel optimistic about our offering there. I think the \\ncurrent environment is maybe a little bit quieter than it was. So, it's maybe not a great moment to , like kind of test whether we're doing a lot \\nmore or less in the space, so to speak.  \\n \\nAnd then, on asset -backed financing, you actually asked me that question before, and at the time, my answer was that I hadn't heard much \\nabout that trend and that contin ues to be the case. But clearly, there must be something I'm missing. So, I can follow up on that and maybe we \\ncan have a chat about it.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nGlenn Schorr  \\nAnalyst, Evercor e ISI  Q \\nNo. That's great for you if you're not hearing much about it, so we can leave it at that. Maybe just one quick follow -up in terms of your just \\noverall posturing. You were patient and smart when rates were low, waited to deploy, worked out great, w e know that story. Now, it seems like \\nyou have tons of excess liquidity and you're being patient and rates are high, and I'm curious on how you think about what ki nd of triggers, \\nwhat kind of things you're looking for in the market to know if and when you would extend duration.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy  Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nRight. I mean, on duration, in truth, we have actually added  a little bit of duration over the last couple of quarters. So, that's one thing to say. \\nThat was more last quarter than this quarter. But, I guess, I would just caution you from a little bit away from looking at k ind of our reported \\ncash balances and our balance sheet and concluding that, when you look at the duration concept holistically, that there is a lot to be done \\ndifferently on the duration front. So, clearly, it's true that empirically we behaved, like very asset -sensitively in this rate hiking cyc le and that \\nhas resulted in a lot of excess NII generation sort of on the way up in the near term.  \\n \\nBut when we look at the Firm's overall sensitivity to rates, we look at it through both, like the EaR -type lens, a short -term NII sensitivity, but \\nalso a va riety of other lenses, including various types of scenario analysis, including impacts on capital and higher rates. And as I think Jamie \\nhas said a couple times, we actually aim to be relatively balanced on that front. Also, given, like the inverted yield curve, it's not as if extending \\nduration from these levels means that you're locking in 5.5% rates. In fact, the forwards are not sort of that compelling giv en our views about \\nsome sort of structural upward pressures on inflation and so on. So, I think whe n you put that all together, I don't think that kind of a big \\nchange in duration posture is a thing that's front of line for us.   \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nGlenn Schorr  \\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI  Q \\nSuper helpful. Thanks so much for that.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nThanks, Glenn.  \\n \\n9 \\n \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\nOperator:  Next, we'll go to the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.   \\n............................................................................................................................. ................................................................... ..................................  \\nMatt O'Connor  \\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.  Q \\nGood morning. I was just wondering if you can elaborate on essentially the math behind the ROTCE being too high at 20% and mo re \\nnormalized at 17%. Obviously, you've pointed to overearning on NII. And I guess, the question is, is that all of it to go from 20% to 17%? And i f \\nso, is that all consumer deposit costs or are there a few other components that you could help frame for us?  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nSure. Good question, Matt. I mean, I guess, the way I think about it is a couple of things, like our returns tend to be a bit  seasonal, right? So, if \\nyou kind of build yourself out a full -year forecast and make reasonable,  just based on your own or analyst consensus or whatever and you \\nthink about fourth quarter, like better look at this on a full -year basis when you think about the returns than the quarterly numbers and you \\nobviously have to strip out kind of the one -time items. And so, if you do that, like whatever you get for this year, is still clearly a number that's \\nhigher than the 17%. So, yeah, one source of headwinds is normalization of the NII, primarily as a result of expected higher deposit costs. \\nThat's – we've talked about that. Part of it is also the yield curve effects. Some cuts will come into the curve at some point.  \\n \\nAnd in the normal course, if you kind of do a very, very, very simple mental model of the company, you would have, like reven ues growing at \\nsome organic GDP, like rate maybe higher, and expenses growing at a similar slightly lower rate producing a sort of relatively stable overhead \\nratio. But even if the amount of NII normalization winds up being less than we might have thought at some prior poi nt, you still have some \\nbackground – you still have some normalization of the overhead ratio that needs to happen. So, as much as our discipline on expense \\nmanagement is as tight as it always has been there, inflation is still non -zero. There are still inv estments that we're executing. There's still \\nhigher expense to come in a slightly flatter revenue environment as a result of, in part, the normalization of NII.  \\n \\nAnd then, the final point is that whatever winds up being the answer on Basel III Endgame and all the other pieces, you have to assume some \\namount of expansion of the denominator, at least based on what we know so far. So, of course, any of those pieces could be wr ong, but that's \\nkind of how we get to our 17%. And if you look at the various scenari os that we showed on the last page of my Investor Day presentation, it \\nillustrates those dynamics and also how much the range could actually vary as a function of the economic environment and othe r factors.  \\n................................................. ............................................................................................................................. ....................................................  \\nMatt O'Connor  \\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.  Q \\nYeah, that was a really helpful chart. Just the one follow -up, on the yield curve effects, I guess, what do you mean by that because right now \\nthe yield curve is inverted, maybe you're still breathing in the impact of that. But kind of longer term, you'd e xpect little bit of steepness of the \\ncurve, which I would think would help. But what did you mean by that? Thank you.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ............. ........................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. I mean, you and I have talked about this before, I guess. I sort of – I guess, I don't really agree fundamentally with the notion that the \\nway to think about things is that sort of yield curve steepness above and beyond what's priced in by the forewords is a sourc e of structural NII \\nor NIM for banks, if you know what I mean. Like, I mean, pe ople have different views about the so -called term premium and obviously, in a \\nmoment of inverted curve and different types of treasury supply dynamics, people's thinking on that may be changing.  \\n \\nBut I think we saw when rates were at zero and the 10 -year note was below 2%, everyone sort of – many people were kind of tempted to try to \\nget extra NIM, extra NII by extending duration a lot. But when the steepness of the curve implies, it is driven by the expect ation of actually \\naggressive Fed tightening, it's just a timing issue and you can wind up kind of pretty offsides from a capital and other perspectives, so. \\nThere're some interesting questions about whether fiscal dynamics might result in a structurally steeper yield curve down the  road and \\nwhether that c ould be sort of earning the term premium, so to speak, could be a source of NII. But that feels a bit speculative to me at th is \\npoint.  \\n......................................................................................................................... .........................................................................................................  \\nMatt O'Connor  \\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.  Q \\nGot it. Okay. Thank you for the details.  \\n \\n10 \\n \\n.................................................... ............................................................................................................................. .................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nThanks, Matt.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ....................................................................................................  \\n \\nOperator:  Next, we'll go to t he line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ................................................................ .....................................  \\nMike Mayo  \\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC  Q \\nHi. Jeremy, you said it's too early to end the overearning narrative and you highlighted higher deposit costs and the impact of lower rates and \\nlower NII and DCM pull-forward and credit costs going higher. Anything I'm missing in that list? And what would cause you to end the \\noverearning narrative?  \\n...................................................................................................................... ............................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nNo. Actually, I think that is the right list, Mike. I mean, frankly, I think one thi ng that would end the overearning narrative is if our annual returns \\nwere closer to 17%. I mean, to the extent that that is the through the cycle number that we believe and that we're currently producing more \\nthan that, that's one very simple way to look a t that. But the pieces of that are the pieces that you talked about and the single most important \\npiece is the deposit margin. Our deposit margins are well above historical norms, and that is a big part of the reason that w e still are \\nemphasizing the overe arning narrative.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................   \\nMike Mayo  \\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC  Q \\nYour 17% through the cycle ROTCE expectation, what is the CET1 ratio that you assume for that?  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nI mean, we would generally assume requirements plus a reasonable buffer, which, depending on the shape of rules, could be a l ittle bit \\nsmaller or a little bit bigger and no small part is a function of the volatility of tho se rules, which goes back to my prior comments on SCB and \\nCCAR. But obviously, as you well know, what actually matters is less the ratio and more the dollars and at this point, the do llars are very much \\na function of where rules land and where the RWA land s and obviously, things like GSIB recalibration and so on. So, we've done a bunch of \\nscenario analysis along the lines of what I did at Investor Day that informs those numbers. But that is obviously one big ele ment of uncertainty \\nbehind that 17%, which is why at Investor Day when we talked about it, both Daniel and I were quite specific about saying that we thought \\n17% was still achievable, assuming a reasonable outcome on the Basel III Endgame.  \\n.............................................................. ............................................................................................................................. .......................................   \\nMike Mayo  \\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC  Q \\nLet me just zoom out for one more question on the return target. I mean, when I asked Jamie at the 2013 Investor Day, would it make sense to \\nhave 13.5% capital, he was basically telling me to take a hike, right? And now, you have 15.3% capital and you're saying, wel l, we might want \\nto have  a lot more capital here. I mean, at some point, if you're spending $17 billion a year to improve the company, if you're gaini ng share \\nwith digital banking, if you're automating the back office, if you're moving ahead with AI, if you're doing all these thi ngs that I think you say \\nothers aren't doing, why wouldn't those returns go higher over time or do you just assume you'll be competing those benefits away? Thanks.  \\n............................................................................................ ............................................................................................................................. .........  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. I mean, I think in short, Mike, and we've talked abo ut this a lot and Jamie's talked about this a lot, it's a very, very, very competitive \\nmarket, and we're very happy with our performance. We're very happy with the share we've taken, and 17% is like an amazing nu mber \\nactually. And like, to be able to do th at, given how robust the competition is from banks, from non -banks, from U.S. banks, from foreign banks, \\nand all of the different businesses that we compete in, is something that we're really proud of. So, the number has a range a round it, \\nobviously. So, i t's not a promise, it's not a guarantee, and it can fluctuate. But we're very proud to be in the ballpark of being able to th ink that  \\n \\n11 \\n \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nwe can deliver it, again, assuming a reasonable outcome on Basel III Endgame. But it's a very, very, very competitive mark et across all of our \\nproducts and services and regions and client segments.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ....................................................... ..............................................   \\nMike Mayo  \\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC  Q \\nAll right. Thank you.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\nOperator:  Next, we'll go to the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ................................................. ....................................................  \\nBetsy L. Graseck  \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nHi, Jeremy. Hi, Jeremy.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nHi, Betsy.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nBetsy L. Graseck  \\nAnalyst, Mor gan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nSo, I did want to ask one drill -down question on 2Q, and it's related to the dollar amount of buybacks that you did do. I think in the press \\nrelease, right, in the slide deck, it's $4.9 billion common stock net repurchases. So, the  question here is, what's the governor for you on how \\nmuch to do every quarter? And, I mean, I understand it's a function of, okay, how much do we organically grow. But even with that, so you get \\nthe organic growth, which you had some nice movement there. But you do the organic growth and then is it how much do we earn and we \\nwant to buy back our earnings or how should we be thinking about what that repurchase volume should be looking like over time ? And I \\nremember over at Investor Day the whole debate arou nd I don't want to buy back my stock, but we are, right? So, I get this question from \\ninvestors quite a bit of how should we be thinking about how you think about what the right amount is to be doing here.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. That's a very good and fair question, Betsy. So, let me try to unpack it to the best of my ability. So, in no particula r order, one thing that \\nwe've really tried to emphasize in a number of different settings, including in our recent 10 -Qs actually i s that we don't want to get into the \\nbusiness of guiding on buybacks. So, we're going to buy back whatever we think makes sense in the current moment sort of and we reserve \\nthe right to sort of change that at any time. So, I recognize that not everyone lov es that, but that is kind of a philosophical belief and so, I might \\nas well say it explicitly. It was pretty clear in the Q also, but I'm just going to say that again. So, that's point one.  \\n \\nBut having said that, let me nonetheless try to address your poin t on framework and governors. So, generally speaking, we think it doesn't \\nmake sense to sort of exit the market entirely unless the conditions are much more unusual than they are right now, let's say . Obviously, when \\nfor whatever reason, if we ever need to  build capital in a hurry, we've done it before and we're always comfortable suspending buybacks \\nentirely. But I think some modest amount of buybacks is a reasonable thing to do when you're generating your kind of capital.  And so, we were \\ntalking before ab out this $2 billion pace. We're kind of trying to move away from this notion of a pace, but that's where that idea comes from , \\nlet's put it that way.  \\n \\nYou talked about the $4.9 billion, which I recognize may seem like a little bit of a random number. But w here that actually comes from is the \\nother statement that we've made that we have these significant item gains from Visa. And if you think about what that means, it means that we  \\nhave, post the acceptance of the exchange offer, a meaningful long position a nd a liquid large cap financial stock, i.e., Visa, which realistically \\nis highly correlated to our own stock. And so, in some sense, why carry that instead of just buying back JPMorgan stock. So, we talked about \\n– Jamie talked about, as we liquidate the Vi sa, deploying those proceeds into JPM and that’s what we did this quarter. So, that is why the $4.9 \\nbillion is a little higher, and it’s consistent with my comments at Investor Day around having slightly increased the amount of buybacks.  \\n \\n \\n12 \\n \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nAnd beyond that, what you’re left with is my answer to Steve’s question, which is that, to your point about buying back earnings or whatever, \\nwhen we’re generating these types of earnings and there’s this much organic capital being generated in the absence of opportu nities  to deploy \\nit organically or inorganically and while continuing to maintain our healthy, but sustainable dividend, if we don’t return th e capital we are going \\nto keep growing the CET1 ratio to levels, which, if you think about the long strategic outlook of  the company, are not reasonable. They’re just \\nartificially high and unnecessary. So, one way or the other, that will need to be addressed at some point. It’s just that we don’t feel that now is \\nthe right time.  \\n............................................. ............................................................................................................................. ........................................................  \\nBetsy L. Graseck  \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nAll right. Thank you, Jeremy. Appreciate it.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ................................................................................................. .... \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nThanks, Betsy.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\nOperator:  Next, we’ll go to the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ....................................................................................................  \\nGerard Cassidy  \\nAnalyst, RBC Ca pital Markets LLC  Q \\nHi, Jeremy. How are you?  \\n............................................................................................................................. ..................................................................................... ................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nHi, Gerard.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nGerard Cassidy  \\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC  Q \\nJeremy, I know you touched on deposits earlier in the call in response to a question. I noticed on the average balances the n on-interest -\\nbearing deposits were relatively stable quarter -to-quarter versus prior quarters wh en they’ve steadily declined. And this is one of the areas, of \\ncourse, investors are focused on in terms of the future of the net interest margin for you and your peers. Can you elaborate,  if you can, what \\nyou’re seeing in that non -interest -bearing deposit  account? I know this is average and not period, and the end number may actually be lower. \\nBut what are you guys seeing here?  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. Good question, Gerard. I have to be honest,  I hadn’t focused on that particular sequential explain, i.e., quarter -on-quarter change and \\naverage non -interest -bearing deposits. But I think the more important question is the big picture question, which is what do we expect? How \\nare we thinking about o ngoing migration of non -interest -bearing into interest -bearing in the current environment and how that affects our NII \\noutlook and our expectation for weighted average rate paid on deposits?  \\n \\nAnd the answer to that question is that, we do continue to expec t that migration to happen. So, if you think about it, in the Wholesale space, \\nyou have a bunch of clients with some balances and non -interest -bearing accounts, and over time for a variety of reasons, we do see them \\nmoving those balances into interest -bearing. So, we do continue to expect that migration to happen and therefore, that will be a source of  \\nheadwinds. And that migration sometimes happens internally, i.e., out of non -interest -bearing into interest -bearing or into CDs. Sometimes, it \\ngoes into mone y markets or into investments, which is what we see happening in our Wealth Management business and some of it does leave \\nthe company. But one of the things that we're encouraged by is the extent to which we are actually capturing a large portion of that y ield-\\nseeking flow through CDs and money market offerings, et cetera, across our various franchises. So, big picture. I do think th at migration out of  \\n \\n13 \\n \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nnon-interest -bearing into interest -bearing will continue to be a thing and that is a contributor to the mo dest headwinds that we expect for NII \\nright now. But, yeah, I'll leave it at that, I guess.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ....................................... ..............................................................  \\nGerard Cassidy  \\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC  Q \\nVery good. And as a follow -up, you've been very clear about the Consumer Credit Card charge -offs and delinquency levels, and we all know \\nabout the Commercial Real Estate Office. And you always talk about overearning on net interest income, of course. One o f the great credit \\nquality stories for everyone, including yourselves, is the C&I portfolio, how strong it's been in this elevated rate environm ent? And I know your \\nnumbers are still quite low, but in the Corporate and Investment Bank, you had about a $500  million pickup in non -accrual loans. Can you \\nshare with us what are you seeing in C&I? Are there any early signs of cracks or anything? And, again, I know your numbers ar e still good, but \\nI'm just trying to look forward to see if there's something here ov er the next 12 months or so.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. It's a good question. I think the short answer is no. We're not really seeing early signs of cracks in C&I. I mean, yes , I agree with you, \\nlike the C&I charge -off rate has been very, very  low for a long time. I think we emphasized that at last year's Investor Day, if I remember \\ncorrectly. I think the C&I charge -off rate we've seen in 10 years was something like literally zero. So, that is clearly very low by historical \\nstandards. And while  we take a lot of pride in that number and I think it reflects the discipline in our underwriting process and the strength of \\nour credit culture across the bankers and the risk team, that's not – we don't actually run that franchise to like a zero loss exp ectation. So, you \\nhave to assume there will be some upward pressure on that. But in any given quarter, the C&I numbers tend to be quite lumpy a nd quite \\nidiosyncratic. So, I don't think that anything in the current quarter's results is indicative of anythin g broader, and I haven't heard anyone \\ninternally talk that way, I would say.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ...................................................... ...............................................  \\nGerard Cassidy  \\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC  Q \\nGreat. Appreciate the insights as always. Thank you.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nThanks, Gerard.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\nOperator:  Next, we'll go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. Please go ahead.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .......................................................................... ...........................  \\nErika Najarian  \\nAnalyst, UBS Securities LLC  Q \\nHi, good morning. I just had one clean -up question, Jeremy. The consensus provision for 2024 is $10.7 billion. Could you maybe clarify for \\nonce and for all sort of Jamie's comments a t an industry conference earlier and try to sort of triangulate if that $10.7 billion provision is \\nappropriate for the growth level that you are planning for in Card?  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. Happy to clarify that. So, Jamie's comments were that the allowance – the build and the Card allowance, so we're talking about Card \\nspecifically, we expected something like $2 billion for the full year. As I sit here today, our expectation for that n umber is actually slightly  \\nhigher, but it's in the ballpark. And I think in terms of what that means for the consensus on the overall allowance change f or the year, last time \\nI checked, it still looked a little low on that front. So, who knows what it'll a ctually wind up being, but that remains our view.  \\n \\nOne question that we've gotten is how to reconcile that build to the 12% growth in OS that we've talked about because it seem s like a little bit \\nhigh relative to what you would have otherwise assumed if yo u apply some sort of a standard coverage ratio to that growth. But the reason  \\n \\n14 \\n \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nthat's the case is essentially a combination of higher revolving mix, as we continue to see some normalization revolve in tha t 12%, as well as \\nseasoning of earlier vintages, whic h comes with slightly higher allowance per unit of OS growth.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ..................................................................... ................................  \\nErika Najarian  \\nAnalyst, UBS Securities LLC  Q \\nGreat. Thank you.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nThanks, Erika.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ......................................................................... ............................  \\n \\nOperator:  And for our final question, we'll go to the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ....................................................................................................  \\nJim Mitchell  \\nAnalyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC  Q \\nOh, hey, good morning. Maybe just one last question on sort of deploying excess capital. It seems like the two primary ways t o do that \\norganically would be through the trading book or the loan book. So, maybe two questions there. One, trading assets were up 20% year -over-\\nyear. Is that you leaning into it or just a function of demand? And is there further opportunities to grow that?  \\n \\nAnd then, secondly, outside of Card, loan demand has been quite weak and any thoughts from yo u on if you're seeing any change in demand \\nor how you're thinking about loan demand going forward? Thanks.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ........................ .............................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nThanks, Jim. Good questions. So, yeah, trading assets have been up. That is basically client activity, primarily secured fina ncing -related sort \\nof matchbook repo -type stuff and similar things that are – gross up the balance sheet quite a bit, but are quite  low risk and therefore, quite low \\nRWA intensity. So, while our ability to supply that financing to clients is something that we're happy about and it's very mu ch represents us \\nleaning into the franchise to serve our clients. It's not really particularly R WA and therefore, capital intensive and therefore, doesn't really \\nreflect an aggressive choice on our part to deploy capital, so to speak.  \\n \\nOn the loan demand front, yeah, I mean, unfortunately, I just don't have much new to say there on loan demand, meani ng, to your point, loan \\ndemand remains quite muted everywhere except Card. Our Card business is, of course, in no way capital constrained. So, whatev er growth \\nmakes sense there in terms of our customer franchise and our ability to acquire accounts and reta in accounts and what fits inside our credit \\nrisk appetite, is growth that's going to make sense. And so, we're very happy to deploy capital to that. But it's not constra ined by our \\nwillingness or ability to deploy capital to that.  \\n \\nAnd, of course, for the rest of the loan space, the last thing that we're going to do is have the excess capital, meaning tha t we lean into lending \\nthat is not inside our risk appetite or inside our credit box, especially in a world where spreads are quite  compressed and terms are under \\npressure. So, there's always a balance between capital deployment and assessing economic risk rationally and frankly, that is , in some sense, \\na microcosm of the larger challenge that we have right now. When I talked about if  there was ever a moment where the opportunity cost of not \\ndeploying the capital relative to how attractive the opportunities outside the walls of the company are, now would be it in t erms of being \\npatient. That's a little bit one example of what I was ref erring to.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJim Mitchell  \\nAnaly st, Seaport Global Securities LLC  Q \\nRight. Okay. Great. Thanks.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\n15 \\n \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Please stand by.  \\n \\nAt this time I would like to turn the call over to JPMorganChase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon and Chief Financial Officer,  Jeremy \\nBarnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  \\nThank you and good morning, everyone. Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $12.9 billion, EPS of $4.37 on revenue of $43.3 \\nbillion with an ROTCE of 19%. Touching on a couple of highlights. In CCB, we ranked number one in retail deposit share for th e fourth straight \\nyear, in CIB, both IB fees and Markets rev enue were notably up year -on-year reflecting strength across the franchise. In AWM, we had record \\nquarterly revenues and record long -term flows.  \\n \\nNow, turning to page 2 for the Firmwide results. The Firm reported revenue of $43.3 billion, up $2.6 billion or 6% year -on-year. NII ex. Markets \\nwas up $274 million or 1% driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securities reinvestment, higher revolvi ng balances in Card and \\nhigher wholesale deposit balances, predominantly offset by lower deposit balances in Banking & Wealth Management and deposit margin \\ncompression.  \\n \\nNIR ex. Markets was up $1.8 billion or 17%, but excluding the prior year’s net investment securities losses, it was up 10% on  higher asset \\nmanagement and investment banking fees. And Markets revenue was up $535 million or 8% year -on-year.  \\n \\nExpenses of $22.6 billion were up $808 million or 4% year -on-year, driven by compensation, including revenue -related compensation and \\ngrowth in employees, partially offset by lower legal expense. And credit costs were $3.1 billion reflecting net charge -offs of $2.1 billion and a \\nnet reserve build of $1 billion, which included a $182 million in Consumer, primarily in Card, and $144 million in Wholesale.  Net charge -offs \\nwere up $590 million year -on-year, predominantly driven by Card.  \\n \\nOn to balance sheet and capital on page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15.3%, flat versus the prior quarter, as  net income and \\nOCI gains were offset by capital distributions and higher RWA. This quarter's RWA reflects higher lending activity,  as well as higher client \\nactivity and market moves on the trading side.  \\n \\nWe had $6.0 billion of net common share repurchases this quarter, which in part reflects the deployment of the proceeds from the sale of Visa \\nshares, as we have previously mentioned.  \\n \\nNow, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 4. CCB reported net income of $4.0 billion on revenue of $17.8 bil lion, which was \\ndown 3% year -on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was down 11% year -on-year, reflecting deposit margin compression and \\nlower deposits, partially offset by growth in Wealth Management revenue. Average deposits were down 8% year -on-year and 2% sequentially. \\nWe're seeing a slowdown in customer yield -seeking activity including in CD volumes and expect deposits to be relatively flat for the remainder \\nof the year.  \\n \\nClient investment assets were up 21% year -on-year driven by market performance, and we continue to see strong referrals of new wealth \\nmanagement clients from our branch network. In Home Lending, revenue was up 3% year -on-year, driven by higher NII, partial ly offset by \\nlower servicing and production revenue.  \\n \\nTurning to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 11% year -on-year, driven by higher Card NII on higher revolving balances. Card \\noutstandings were up 11% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve. And in Auto, originati ons were $10 \\nbillion, down 2%, while maintaining strong margins and high -quality credit. Expenses of $9.6 billion were up 5% year -on-year, predominantly \\ndriven by higher field and technology compensation as well as growth in marketing.  \\n \\nIn terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $2.8 billion driven by Card, and reflected net charge -offs of $1.9 billion, up $520 \\nmillion year -on-year, and a net reserve build of $876 million predominantly from higher revolving balances.  \\n \\nNext, the Commercial & Investment Bank on page 5. The CIB reported net income of $5.7 billion on revenue of $17 billion. IB f ees were up \\n31% year -on-year and we ranked number one with year -to-date wallet share of 9.1%. In Advisory, fees were up 10% benefit ing from the \\n \\n3 \\n \\nclosing of few large deals. Underwriting fees were up meaningfully with debt up 56% and equity up 26%, primarily driven by fa vorable market \\nconditions.  \\n \\nIn light of the positive momentum throughout the year, we're optimistic about our pipeline, but the M&A regulatory environmen t and \\ngeopolitical situation are continued sources of uncertainty. Payments revenue was $4.4 billion, up 4% year -on-year, driven by  fee growth and \\nhigher deposit balances, largely offset by margin compression.  \\n \\nMoving to Markets. Total revenue was $7.2 billion, up 8% year -on-year. Fixed Income was flat reflecting outperformance in Currencies & \\nEmerging Markets and lower revenue in Rates. Equities was up 27% reflecting strong performance across regions, largely driven by a \\nsupportive trading environment in the U.S. and increased late -quarter activity in Asia.  \\n \\nSecurities Services revenue was $1.3 billion, up 9% year -on-year, largely driven by fee growth on higher market levels and volumes. \\nExpenses of $8.8 billion were down 1% year -on-year, with lower legal expense predominantly offset by higher revenue -related compensation \\nand growth in employees, as well as higher technology spend.  \\n \\nAverage Banking & Payments loans were down 2% year -on-year and down 1% sequentially. In the middle market and large corporate client \\nsegments we continue to see softness in both new loan demand and revolver utilization in part due to clients’ access to rec eptive capital \\nmarkets. In multi -family, while we are seeing encouraging signs in loan originations as long -term rates fall, we expect overall growth to remain \\nmuted in the near term as originations are offset by payoff activity.  \\n \\nAverage client deposits were up 7% year -on-year and 3% sequentially, primarily driven by growth from large corporates in Payments and \\nSecurities Services. Finally, credit costs were $316 million, driven by higher net lending activity, including in Markets,  and downgrades, \\npartially offset by improved macroeconomic variables.  \\n \\nThen to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 6. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.4 billion with pre -tax margin \\nof 33%. For the quarter, revenue of $5.4 billion was up 9% year -on-year, driven by growth in management fees on higher average market \\nlevels and strong net inflows, investment valuation gains compared to losses in the prior -year, and higher brokerage activity, partially offset by \\ndeposit margin compression.  \\n \\nExpenses of $3.6 billion were up 16% year -on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including revenue -related compensation \\nand continued growth in our private banking advisor teams as well as higher distribution fees and legal expense. For the quarter, long -term net \\ninflows were $72 billion, led by Fixed Income and Equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $34 billion. AUM of $3.9 trillion and client \\nassets of $5.7 trillion were both up 23%, [year -on-year] driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows. And finally, loans were up \\n2% quarter -on-quarter, and deposits were up 4% quarter -on-quarter.  \\n \\nTurning to Corporate on page 7. Corporate reported net income of $1.8 billion. Revenue was $3.1 billion, up $1.5 billion year -on-year. NII was \\n$2.9 billion, up $932 million year -on-year, predominantly driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securitie s reinvestment, including from \\nprior quarters.  \\n \\nNIR was a net gain of $155 million compared with a net loss of $425 million in the prior year, predominantly driven by lower net investment \\nsecurities losses this quarter. Expenses of $589 million were down $107 million year -on-year.  \\n \\nTo finish up, let's turn to the outlook on page 8. We now expect 2024 NII ex. Markets to be approximately $91.5 billion and t otal NII to be \\napproximately $92.5 billion. Our outlook for adjusted expense is now about $91.5 billion. And given where we are in the year, we included on \\nthe page, the implied fourth quarter guidance for NII and adjusted expense, and note, that the NII numbers imply about $800 m illion of Markets \\nNII in the fourth quarter. On credit, we continue to expect the 2024 Card net charge -off rate to be approximately 3.4%.  \\n \\nSo, to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating performance. As we look ahead to the next few quarters , we expect \\nresults will be somewhat challenged as normalization continues, but we remain upbeat and focused on executing in order to continue \\ndelivering excellent returns through the cycle.  \\n \\nAnd with that, let's open the line for Q&A.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\n \\nQUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION  \\n  \\nOperator : Thank you. Please stand by. Our first question will come from the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. You ma y \\nproceed.    \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\n \\n4 \\n \\nJim Mitchell  \\nAnalyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC  Q \\nHey, good morning. So, Jeremy, as you highlighted, full year NII guidance implies a sizable drop in Q4 NII ex. Markets about 6%. So, can you \\njust maybe discuss what are the largest drivers of the sequential decline including any initial thoughts on deposit  behavior and pricing since \\nthe 50 basis point cut?  \\n \\nAnd since it's related, I'll just throw out my follow -up question. I realize the forward curve is moving around a lot, but since Dan brought it up a \\nmonth ago, can you frame how you're thinking about the NII trajectory for 2025? Thanks.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.   A \\nYeah. Sure, Jim. I'll try to answer both questions together to the best of my ability. So, as we sit here today, the biggest single driver of the \\nsequential decline is, in fact – that we're expecting – is, in fact, the yield curve. So, that yield curve has changed a little bit since Daniel made \\nhis comments at the conference earlier in the quarter, but not that significantly.  \\n \\nIn terms of deposit balances, which is obviously another important factor here in light of the Fed starting the cutting cycle , it feels to us like \\nright now, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks for Consumer, we're pretty much in the trough right now as w e speak. When you look at \\nyield-seeking behavior that has come down quite a bit, so that's no longer as much of a headwind all else being equal. And then if you look at \\nchecking account balances, those have been pretty stable for some time, which we see as  an indication that consumers are kind of done \\nspending down their cash buffers. So that's kind of supportive for consumer deposit balances.  \\n \\nAnd in that context, the other relevant point is the CD mix where, with the rate cuts coming, we expect CD balances to price down with pretty \\nhigh betas and probably the CD mix actually peaking around now.  \\n \\nAnd then as we move to Wholesale, we've actually already been seeing a little bit of growth there, and when you combine that with the sort of \\nincreasing view that many people in the market have that it's likely that the end of QT will be announced sometime  soon, that's also a little bit \\nsupportive for deposit balances.  \\n \\nSo, maybe, I'll – well, I guess then you also asked me a little bit about next year. So, I guess one thing to say, right, is that we did have a  \\nsequential increase in NII this quarter and, as you may recall, at Investor Day, I said that there was some chan ce that we would see sequential \\nincreases followed by sequential declines and that people should avoid kind of drawing the conclusion that we'd hit the troug h when that \\nhappens. So that's essentially exactly what we're seeing now.  \\n \\nBut from where we sit now, given the yield curve, assuming the yield curve materializes obviously, we do see a pretty clear p icture of \\nsequential declines in NII ex. Markets, but the trough may be happening sometime in the middle of next year, at which poi nt the combination of \\nbalances, Card revolve growth and other factors can return us to sequential growth, obviously.  \\n \\nWe're guessing it's pretty far out in the future, and we'll give you formal guidance on all this stuff next quarter, but I th ink that gives you a better \\nframework to work with.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJim Mitchell  \\nAnalyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC  Q \\nAll right. Thanks a lot.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nThanks.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\n \\nOperator:  Thank you. Thank you. Next we will go to the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\n \\n \\n \\n5 \\n \\nSteven Chubak  \\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research LLC  Q \\nHi. Good morning. So Jeremy, how are you? So I do want to ask on expenses, just in light of some of the comments that Daniel had made \\nrecently, just noting that consensus expense forecast for next year looked a little bit too light. I believe at the time it w as just below $94 billion. \\nIf we adjust for the one -timers this year, that would suggest a core expense base that's just below  $90 billion, so pretty healthy step -up in \\nexpenses. I know you've always had a strong commitment and discipline around investment. Just want to better understand where  those \\nincremental dollars are being deployed and just which investments are being prior itized in particular looking out to next year.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nSure. So good question and I agree with your numbers. I agree with the way you've normalized this year for the one -time type of significant \\nitems and also where the consensus was when Daniel made his comments.  \\n \\nAnd while we're at it, I would also just remind you on the NII comments at the time, the consensus for this year was $91.5 bi llion and for next \\nyear it was $90 billion so that was implying at the time a sequential decline of $1.5 billion. It was because we  felt that decline wasn't big \\nenough that we made the comments that we made. So happy to expand more on that, but anyway.  \\n \\nTo expenses. Yeah. So if you start for the sake of argument with a base of $90 billion, obviously, inflation is normalizing a nd obviously we're \\nalways trying to generate efficiencies to offset inflation. But, that having been said, if you assume 3% for the  sake of argument on that base, \\nthat's a few billion dollars right out of the gates that we're working against. So that's one thing.  \\n \\nThe other thing is that we have continued to execute on our growth strategies this year so there's a not insignificant amount  of annualization. \\nYou can't quite see that in the fourth quarter numbers because of the seasonality of incentive comp., but if you  were to strip that out, you \\nwould see probably some sequential increases and so annualization as an additional headwind.  \\n \\nThe other thing that's worth noting is that we do expect fees and volume -related businesses to grow next year. And so all else being equal, \\nthat would come with a higher expense loading. So when you assemble all of those, that goes a long way to explain wh y sort of that \\nconsensus number that is slightly below $94 billion just seemed light.  \\n \\nIn terms of priorities and investments, really nothing has changed, like the strategy hasn't changed. The strategy hasn't cha nged and the plans \\nhaven't changed and we're just kind of executing with the same long -term perspective that we've always had.  \\n \\nI would note that relative to NII, obviously, we're in the third quarter now, not the fourth quarter. And in the old days, we  did used to give you \\nthe guidance until Investor Day in late February. So we will give you formal expense guidance next quarter fo r both, well, for expenses and NII \\nnext quarter. But especially on expenses, we are in the middle of the budget cycle right now so we probably have a little les s visibility there \\nthan we do at the margin on NII.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nAnd can I just give you just a view of expense a little bit? What you call expenses very often I call investments. If you act ually go back to \\nInvestor Day, you'll see that we're adding private bankers in Asset & Wealth Management, we're adding ETF in Asset  & Wealth Management, \\nwe're adding private bankers in international Private Banking. We're growing Chase Wealth Management. We've added some branch es \\nacross the United States of America. We think there are huge opportunities for Innovation Economy that tak es bankers and certain \\ntechnology, stuff like that.  \\n \\nOur goal is to gain share and everything we do, we get really good returns on it. So I look at that, these are opportunities for us. These are not \\nexpenses that we have to actually punish ourself on. And we do get, and we show you kind of extensively cost and productivity  on various \\nthings. And also AI is going to go up a little bit and I would put that as a category that just is going to generate great stuff over time.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nSteven Chubak  \\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research LLC  Q \\nThank you both for the color. Just a quick follow -up for me, just drilling down into NII. It appears you redeployed a fair amount of cash or \\nexcess reserves at the Fed into securities. We saw the yield expand, which was encouraging, despite the pressure at  both the long end and \\nSOFR contraction in the quarter. I was hoping you could just speak to your appetite to extend duration in this environment. I  know that you've  \\n \\n6 \\n \\nSteven Chubak  \\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research LLC  Q \\nhad some aversion to that in the past. But do you anticipate redeploying additional excess liquidity just amid the expectatio n for deeper rate \\ncuts?  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. Sure. So on extending duration, Steve, you know this obviously, but I just think it's important to say that all else equal, extending \\nduration doesn't change expected NII if you assume that the policy rate follows the forward, right? So, point one.  \\n \\nPoint two, the curve remains inverted. And so even if you don't believe that the policy rate follows the forwards, extending right now is actually \\na headwind to short -term NII like that wouldn't be a consideration for us either way, but I just think that's  worth saying for the broader \\naudience. It's quite different from the situation that you have on the numbers...  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................   \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\n... people have mortgages at 6%, so, right.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. Now so when we think of the question of extending duration and really managing duration right now, a couple things to sa y. So, \\nobviously, a lot of different versions of duration, but one number that we disclose is the EaR. When the 10 -Q comes out, you'll see that that \\nnumber is a little bit lower. It'll come down from $2.8 billion to about $2.1 billion if our current estimates are correct. T hat's for a number of \\nreasons, some of which are passive, but so me of those are active choices to extend duration a little bit.  \\n \\nAnd in the end, the choice to manage and extend duration is really about balancing the volatility of NII against protecting t he company from \\nextreme scenarios on either side. And so right now, if we wanted to extend as a result of different factors, we cer tainly could. We have the \\ncapacity inside the portfolio. But for now, we're comfortable with where we are.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nAnd the one thing I can assure you is the forward curve will not be the same forward curve in six months.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nSteven Chubak  \\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research LLC  Q \\nWell said. Well, thank you so much for taking my questions.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nThanks, Steve.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ....................................................................................................  \\n \\nOperator : Thank you. Next we will go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. You may proceed.   \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nErika Najarian  \\nAnalyst, UBS Securities LLC  Q \\nMy first question, and thank you very much for answering all the NII questions so far, Jeremy, is just I guess another follow -up. As you can \\nimagine, once Daniel said what he said on stage in September, everyone is trying to figure out the over/under for net interest income next \\nyear. So maybe a two -part first question, the second being inspired by what Jamie just said.  \\n \\n7 \\n \\nErika Najarian  \\nAnalyst, UBS Securities LLC  Q \\nNumber one, NII is expected to be down 6% sequentially in fourth quarter. I think year -over-year in 2025, consensus has it down 4% from your \\nnew level. So it sounds like consensus still has room to come down, and based on the forward curve, Jeremy, it coul d be a little bit worse \\nyear-over-year than the fourth quarter sequential rate. But that being said, as Jamie noted, we have no idea what the curve is going to  look \\nlike. Right? It's gyrated so much. And so as we think about the curve, is it better for JPM organ to have more cuts in the short end but \\nsteepness or less cuts but a little bit of a flatter curve?  \\n............................................................................................................................. ....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nRight. Okay. You threw a curve ball at the end there, Erika. I wasn't expecting that to be the end of your question. But let me answer the \\nbeginning of your question, and then I'll also answer the end of your question.  \\n \\nSo we see the current 2025 consensus for NII ex. Markets to be currently at $87 billion, which is obviously lower than it was  at the conference \\nearlier in the quarter. So we're happy to see that move a little bit more in line to us. That still looks a litt le toppy, but it's definitely in the \\nballpark.  \\n \\nNow that consists of, I already mentioned previously that we sort of expect the NII trough sometime in the middle of the year , so you can kind \\nof assemble the parts. You've got a fourth quarter run rate, you've got some sequential declines, you've got a tr ough in the middle of the year, \\nand you've got a rough ballpark for the full year.  \\n \\nSo you can imagine that the trough probably is a little lower than those numbers and then to the extent that growth revolve r esumes in the \\nback half of the year in both deposit balances and the ongoing tailwind of Card revolve, although that tailwind will be a little bit less than you \\nmight have otherwise thought. I mean, sorry. A little bit less than it was this year but still a tailwind.  \\n \\nObviously, the mix of those things will play out in different ways, and as you point out, who knows what the yield curve will  wind up doing. But \\non our current assumptions, on the current yield curve, and remembering that we're in the third quarter now, so  we're doing this kind of early, \\nthat's what we think.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nCan I just say something. First of all, next time let's just give them the damn number. I don't want to spend all the time on these calls li ke going \\nthrough what they're guessing what NII is going to be next year.  \\n \\nCan I just also point out that NII, all things being equal, is a number, but all things are never equal. And the yield curve,  if you have a recession \\nthe effect of the yield curve will be very different than if you have continued growth. And there are deci sions that are made nonstop by us and \\nthe things that happen in the marketplace, and I think we spend too much time on just this irrelevancy so you get a model, a number in your \\nmodel. And so it's going to be less than $87 billion next year. Probably not a  lot, we don't know, and we don't know the environment.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nGood. Okay. Now to your question about the EaR. So, a few things to say in there. So, as I already mentioned, when that comes  out, it'll show \\na number around $2.1 billion. A very important thing to say is, as you know, the experience of this rate cycle has been that our empirical EaR \\nis meaningfully higher than our modeled EaR, which is what we disclose. And the main reason for that is that retail deposit b etas have, in \\nactuality, been lower than the modeled deposi t betas.  \\n \\nSo as a starting point, you have to kind of adjust that EaR number to be bigger than the reported number for those and a few other reasons, \\nactually, there's some nuances around how the dollar, non -dollar sensitivity interact. And then there's your questio n which is a little bit about \\nthe front -end versus the back -end. \\n \\nSo, what you see is that actually the front -end EaR has gotten smaller and most of the EaR is now in the back -end. So, it's definitely the case \\nthat, all else being equal, a steeper curve is better for us. But I think what I would also say is that this kin d of empirical versus theoretical \\nadjustment is disproportionately in the front -end. So therefore, in order to answer your question, I would say, yes, we want a steeper curve, but \\nhaving the Fed cut more than what's currently in the yield curve is definite ly at the margin, for the context of next year's numbers a headwind – \\nwould be a headwind for us, we remain asset sensitive to Fed cuts.   \\n \\n8 \\n \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nErika Najarian  \\nAnalyst, UBS Securities LLC  Q \\nAnd if I can ask my second question, and, Jamie, I completely understand your frustration. And to be fair, your long -term shareholders really \\ndon't care about whether it's $87 billion or $85 billion. Right? They care about your return on equity. To that end, I mean, it's insane how much \\ncapital you generate each quarter, 72 basis points this quarter.  \\n \\nAnd so, beyond the standard boilerplate questions you're going to get on buyback and organic growth, yada, yada, dividend inc reases, how \\nshould we think about JPMorgan deploying this capital? I mean, the world is generally your oyster, right? You're domina nt already, and you \\ncould use this capital to further enhance your business.  \\n \\nAnd again, beyond that boilerplate conversation that you always get every quarter, how should your shareholders think about h ow you're \\nthinking about the opportunities to deploy this capital?  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nOkay. First of all, when you say dominant, I'd be very careful on that. We've got some very tough competition, different in d ifferent countries, \\ndifferent around the world, fintech companies, direct lenders and I want to give you a very specific comment on  direct lending and stuff like \\nthat. So our goal is always to serve our clients. And when I talk about some of these expenses, that is a deployment of capit al, and it's a \\ndeployment in a different way. If you open branches, you initially experience an expe nse, but down the road you need capital to support the \\ndeposits. Same for the Innovation Economy, same for private bankers, et cetera. If you look at it roughly, we have about a mi nimum $30 billion \\nof excess capital. And for me, it's not burning a hole in my pocket. I look at it as you own the whole company and you can't properly deploy it \\nnow, it is perfectly reasonable to wait. And I've been quite clear that I think the future could be quite turbulent. And asse t prices, in my view, in \\nlife you've got to t ake a view sometimes, are inflated. I don't know if they're extremely inflated or a little bit, but I prefer to wait.  \\n \\nWe will be able to deploy it. Our shareholders will be very well served by us waiting. And same thing with deploying capital.  We can go buy \\n$100 billion, 6% mortgages, increase our net income by a couple billion tomorrow. We don't make decisions like that.  The most important thing \\nwe do is serve our clients well, build the technology and do things like that. And we also don’t know what the real excess ca pital is yet. So, \\nwe're a little patient. We're going to be a little patient and wait, and it'll be fine.  \\n \\nAnd so that's where we are, and that's not going to change. And if it changes, we'll let you know. We do talk to a lot of sha reholders, and they \\nunderstand that buying stock back at more than two times tangible book value is not necessarily the best thing to do, because we think we'll \\nhave better opportunities to redeploy it or to buy back at cheaper prices at one point. Markets do not stay high forever.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nErika Najarian  \\nAnalyst, UBS Securities LLC  Q \\nThank you.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nOne last thing. Cash is a very valuable asset sometimes in a turbulent world. And you see my friend Warren Buffett stockpilin g cash right now. \\nI mean, people should be a little more thoughtful about how we're trying to navigate in this world and grow for t he long term for our company.   \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\nOperator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. You may proceed.   \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nGlenn Schorr  \\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI  Q \\nHi. Thanks very much. And so glad Jamie didn't say what he was about to say because that's the answer to this question.  \\n \\nSo we've seen a couple more banks entering partnerships with alternative managers. We've seen limited loan growth for a few y ears now, \\nmarket -related also; limited flows into fixed income funds, yet plenty of growth in private credit in general. And you're  one of the best asset \\nmanagers on the planet, but in my view, less dominant in all things private credit. So maybe you could talk about what things  you're working  \\n \\n9 \\n \\nGlenn Schorr  \\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI  Q \\non and why that's too narrow of a view of your ability to serve all parts of clients’ lending needs, not just the public markets and public lending \\nside. Thanks.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. So let me take time to cover this one, because obviously it has become very important. People talking about how they're  growing and \\npartnering and things like that.  \\n \\nAnd so first and foremost – I’m going to talk about very strategic and then very tactical, I think they're both important. First and foremost, we \\nare here to give our clients an agnostic view of the world and what the best product and services are for them. Therefore, wh en a client come s \\nin, we will offer them both direct lending, ourselves, and syndicated lending or other specialized kind of lending. And they all have pluses and \\nminuses.  \\n \\nDirect lending could be done faster, maybe simpler covenants, unitranche. It is more expensive and you're just seeing a littl e things go back \\nand forth between syndicated lending and direct lending. But we're going to offer the clients basically what's in their best interest and tell them \\nwhat those products are across the venue.  \\n \\nWe mentioned before in the past that we allocated $10 billion of capital to make direct loans. We've actually deployed a lot of capital. Some of \\nthose have already been paid off, some of it’s done. So we are going to do it directly and we are going to – $10 billion could be $20 billion or \\n$30 billion, not limiting it today. I will say today, we're extending. We will do $500 million, we will do $1 billion, we wil l do more than $1 billion, \\nwe'll do it sole -handed or we'll do it with partners.  \\n \\nVery importantly, we are not going to allocate ourselves to one partner. So we have – I think we've announced a bunch of co -lenders, but that \\njust creates more flexibility and more size. We're not going to use that flexibility to slow it down and have to g et permission from everybody, \\nbecause like I said, JPMorgan could underwrite it and own it like a bridge loan and syndicate it after the fact. And we're go ing to use our own \\nrisk measures and stuff like that, again, all in the service of the client and mak ing sure we're offering them the best thing.  \\n \\nAnd we're going with different strategies. We're not going to tie ourselves exclusively to one capital provider. I think that  would limit what we \\ncould offer our clients, it probably would be more price competitive. We could do some of this very specific t hing and not the solution that this \\nis the third -party capital provider. That's our strategy. We're going to be there, we're going to do it, and we're going to do it in spite  of the fact \\nthere's capital arbitrage taking place.  \\n \\nSo if you look at the arbitrage today, where a bank has to hold for things, where insurance could, they are dramatically diff erent. That's a \\ndisadvantage, but we've had those disadvantages in other businesses for a long time. We are going to do what's righ t for the client. \\nRemember, when we do business with a client, we also get other revenues off of them. So it isn't just the loan; we look at th e whole \\nrelationship. So we're quite comfortable we can compete. I just announced much bigger lending platforms a nd sizes and stuff like that, so I \\nhope if any of the press is on they heard this too.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nGlenn Schorr  \\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI  Q \\nAll right. Thanks for all that.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nGerard Cassidy  \\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC  Q \\nGood morning, Jeremy, and good morning, Jamie. Jeremy, when you guys look at your current capital ratios, they are obviously very healthy. \\nCan you guys give us some color on the new Basel III? We don't know what the specifics are, but as Vice Chair Barr to uched on some of the \\nspecifics, it looks like capital requirements for yourself and your peers will come down a fair amount from the original prop osal.  \\n \\nHow are you guys thinking about that? Do you have any insights on how much it may fall from the original proposal to where yo u are today?  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n10 \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. When I said we're at $30 billion of excess, that is assuming Barr's speech, that the 20% goes to 12% or whatever it is, more. It'll be \\nmore than that because there are other factors involved. Now, I was just giving the minimum of excess capital. In my view, it  would be more, \\nbut it is what it is and we'll wait to see the final numbers.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nBut, Gerard, just maybe to give you a bit of color. So, yeah. Obviously, everyone paid a lot of attention to that speech. It was an important \\nspeech. But in the end, we actually just really need to see the proposal because the details matter a lot for this stuff. And so our focus is on \\nhoping to see the proposal so that we can process the detail and continue advocating as appropriate.  \\nI note that you talk about requirements coming down relative to what was originally proposed which was obviously true per the speech, but I \\ndo think we need to be a little bit careful not to fall into the trap of saying that that's like progress just because the or iginal proposal wa s so \\ndramatically higher than what anyone thought was reasonable. And I would remind you, which you obviously know, that before th is proposal \\ncame out, it was our position strongly felt, that our then -prevailing capital requirements were, if anything, alre ady more than we needed.  \\nSo we've got a long way to go here, and I think our position, which Jamie has been articulating very consistently, is that th ey need to get it \\nright with the right amount of work, and importantly, do it holistically so it's not just RWA. It's RWA, it's G -SIB, it's SCB, it's CCAR. So that's \\nreally what we feel strongly about.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nWe just want the numbers to be done right and justified. If they had to go up, we would be fine with that too. We just think they should be done \\nwith real diligence and real thought and a little bit of thought about cost benefit, what it does to the econom y, where it pushes lending and \\nthings like that. So we're anxiously awaiting to see the actual detail, because that's what's going to make all the differenc e. \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nGerard Cassidy  \\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC  Q \\nVery good. And then as a follow -up, in view of this excess capital and your comments a moment ago about direct lending, you look at your \\ncurrent cash and marketable securities on a risk-weighted asset basis, you put it in your presentation of course, $1.5 trillion. Average loans is \\n$1.3 trillion. When the dust settles, you know what your capital requirements are. Can you frame out for us, levering up the excess capital with \\nmore loan s, is that a path that might be considered over the next two or three years relative to where you are on a mix basis? I know you're \\ngoing to grow your loans, but I'm talking about the mix.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nAbsolutely, positively not. Loans are an outcome of doing good business. We want to do good business. If it grows our balance  sheet, we're \\nfine. \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nAnd I do think, Gerard, it depends a lot on what type of loans you're talking about, right? So I think in the end, as Jamie says, like it's capital. \\nWe're going to deploy it ideally to grow the franchise organically, and that could include loans that are almost good loans o n a stand -alone \\nbasis, as well as loans that are part of an overall relationshi p, what we're getting other revenue as part of that. So it's the same strategy that \\nwe've always had, but I wouldn't think of it as like excess capital to be deployed against a particular product. I would thin k of it as it's there for a \\nrainy day. Let's ho pe the environment doesn't deteriorate a lot, but if it does, we'll be ready. And there will be opportunities hopefully to de ploy \\nit against a client franchise or against a stock. And if not, we'll return it. But not now.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\n11 \\n \\nGerard Cassidy  \\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC  Q \\nVery good. Appreciate the color and candor, as always. Thank you.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\nOperator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................   \\nMatt O'Connor  \\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.  Q \\nGood morning. So lower rates was supposed to drive a pick -up in loan growth and conversion of some of these investment banking pipelines. \\nObviously, we just had one cut and it's early. But any beginning signs of this in terms of the interest in borrowing m ore, and again, conversion \\nof the banking pipelines?  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nI would say, Matt, generally no, frankly, with a couple of minor exceptions. So I think it's probably fair to say that the ou tperformance late in the \\nquarter in investment banking fees was to a meaningful degree, as I mentioned, driven by DCM as well as to  some degree driven by the \\nacceleration of the closing of some M&A transactions. And I do think that some of that DCM outperformance is in the sort of t ypes of deals that \\nare opportunistic deals that aren't in our pipeline, and those are often driven by tr easurers and CFOs sort of seeing improvement in market \\nlevels and jumping on those. So it's possible that that's a little bit of a consequence of the cuts.  \\n \\nAs I think I mentioned we did see, for example, a pick -up in mortgage applications and a tiny bit of pick -up in refi. And our multi -family lending \\nbusiness, there might be some hints of more activity there. But these cuts were very heavily priced. Right? T he curve has been inverted for a \\nlong time. So to a large degree, this is expected. So it's not obvious to me that you should expect immediate dramatic reacti ons, and that's not \\nreally what we're seeing.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. And also in the debt markets, rates came down, spreads are quite low, and markets are wide open. So it kind of makes sense that \\npeople are taking advantage of that today. Those conditions may not prevail, be the ongoing conditions late next year.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nMatt O'Connor  \\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.  Q \\nAnd then specifically in the debit and credit card spend that you guys break out, you had nice growth year -over-year, up 6%, flat quarter -over-\\nquarter, I know there's a lot of seasonality 2Q to 3Q. I think last year, it was up about 1%. But are you seeing any kind of changes in the \\nconsumer spend either the mix or some signs of a slowdown later in the quarter? Thank you.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nSo I think what there is to say about consumer spend is a little bit boring in a sense because what's happened is that it's become normal, so \\nmeaning – I mean, I think we're getting to the point where it no longer makes sense to talk about the pandemic, but maybe one last time . One \\nof the things that you had was that heavy rotation into T&E as people did a  lot of traveling and they booked cruises that they hadn't done \\nbefore, and everyone was going out to dinner a lot, whatever. So you had the big spike in T&E, the big rotation into discreti onary spending, \\nand that's now normalized. And you would normally t hink that rotation out of discretionary into nondiscretionary would be a sign of consumers \\nbattening down the hatches and getting ready for a much worse environment. But given the levels that it started from, what we  see it as is \\nactually like normalizatio n. And inside that data, we're not seeing weakening, for example, in retail spending.  \\n \\nSo overall, we see the spending patterns as being sort of solid and consistent with the narrative that the consumer is on sol id footing and \\nconsistent with the strong labor market and the current central case of a kind of no -landing scenario economically. But obviously, as we \\nalways point out, that's one scenario and there are many other scenarios.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\n12 \\n \\nMatt O'Connor  \\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.  Q \\nGot it. Thank you.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\nOperator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ....................................................................................................  \\nMike Mayo  \\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC  Q \\nHey. Jamie, I think I've seen you comment on government this year more than any other time in your career. And the August 2 o p-ed, \\nWashington Post, Davos you're talking about government. I think it was this week or last week on Bloomberg, you're saying ban k mergers \\nshould be allowed. Your bus tour in August, you were asked, which is my question now, under what circumstances would you leav e for \\ngovernment service and your answer then was “I love what I do.” We get it you love what you do. But under what circ umstances would you \\nconsider government service? It seems like you'd be more likely to go now than in the past just based on the numerous comment s that you've \\nmade. Is that right, wrong, what's your thinking?  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nI think it's wrong. I've always been an American patriot. My country is more important to me than my company, and I think thi s government is \\nvery important to get this – and if you look at the world today, Mike, it is so important that we get things right for the whole geopolitical world. \\nI'm not just talking about the American economy, and we try to participate in policy at the local level, at the state level, at the federal level, at \\nthe international leve l to try to help. That's our job. We try to grow economies and things like that. So nothing has changed in my view, my \\nopinion, or my interest. I just think it's very, very important that we try to help the government do a good job.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nMike Mayo  \\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC  Q \\nSo if you were asked by the next administration to serve the country, would you be open to considering it?  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nI think the chance of that is almost nil and I probably am not going to do it, but I've always reserved the right. I don't make promise to people. I \\ndon't have to. But no, I love what I do. I intend to be doing what I'm doing. I almost guarantee I'll be doing this for a lon g period of time or at \\nleast until the board kicks me out.   \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nMike Mayo  \\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC  Q \\nLet me take the flip side of that question for those of you who are worried about you leaving. The other side of the question  is we were on \\nthese calls the last couple of years. You're saying the stock is over -valued, and I think that's what you're saying.  You're saying the stock \\nmarket is over -valued and therefore all stocks are over -valued. And on the one hand, you guys, you highlight on this call AI, tech, market \\nshare gains, high returns, high capital. So, do you think in some ways when we think about t he value of your price, and your ability to do \\nbuybacks, you're thinking more about an old school model for valuing your stock as opposed to a new school model that might p ut you in the \\ncategory of more tech -oriented firms, especially as it relates to your  progress with AI.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nListen, you're making a very good point, which is I think we have an exceptional company, exceptional franchises, and the pri ce point at which \\nyou might buy the stock. But I'm not that exuberant about thinking even tech valuations or any valuations will stay at these very inflated values. \\nAnd so I'm just – we're just quite patient in that, and I think you're going to have to judge us over time about whether we're done the right t hing \\nto do nothing. And remember, we could always do it. We haven't lost the money. It didn't go away. It's sitting in store. The onl y time that would \\nbe really wrong is if the stock runs way up, we've got to buy at much higher prices. And I just, I would be a rea l skeptic about that happening.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\n13 \\n \\n \\nOperator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Your line is open.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nEbrahim H. Poonawala  \\nAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Q \\nYeah, good morning. I guess just wanted to follow -up. You talked about private credit and the disruption to bank lending. Another area I would \\nappreciate if you can address is we've been hearing a lot about the likes of Jane Street and other market makers potentially disrupting fixed \\nincome trading. Is that a real risk? And is there an opportunity for a firm like JPMorgan to actually compete on the private venue side on \\nmarket making beyond traditional sort of FICC activi ty? \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah, Ebrahim, the way I would frame that is not as a risk but as a reality. We've always emphasized in all of our businesses  that we operate \\nin an extremely competitive environment, and that applies to – and that competitive environment isn't limited to c ompeting against banks or \\ntraditional financial institutions. It extends in the consumer space to fintechs. And in the market making space, it obviousl y increasingly is \\nextending to some of the types of firms that you're referring to.  \\n \\nNow those firms are, in many cases, also clients. And that's the same type of dynamic that you see, for example, in the priva te credit space \\nthat we've discussed before. So there's no question that the ecosystem is changing. You've got new competitors. You 've got changes in \\nmarket structure, new dynamics. And as with any business, we are innovating and adjusting and making sure that we're prepared  to compete \\nin all the traditional ways and all the new ways.  \\n \\nOf course, there are some ways in which being a bank hinders our ability to do that. And one of the arguments that we've made  going back to \\nthe capital and liquidity regulations is that when you come to the impact on the kind of U.S. capital markets ecosys tem, which is the end view \\nof the world, its worked well in its current construct for a long time where some activities were inside the regulated perime ter and there was \\nrobust participation from unregulated capital of various sorts. And a world where more  and more of that activity gets pushed outside of bank \\nmarket makers is a meaningful change to that structure that is untested, and it's unclear why you would want that. And we've cautioned that if \\nthat's the intent of the regulations, it should be intenti onal and well -studied. But in the meantime, we're going to adjust and compete to the best \\nof our ability given the constraints of the current rule set.   \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nThe previous answer on the private markets, it remains to be seen how that develops. There is a little bit of that, and some people are talking \\nabout making more active things in private markets. In some ways we're well -positioned for that too, because for that you need liquidity, \\nmarket -making valuation, buyers and sellers on bo th sides to create liquidity. So that hasn't developed yet, but we may have competition, but \\nwe'll be there when the time comes.  \\n \\nAnd the second one is the public markets. You have seen reports about you have deal inventories, both corporate and treasurie s. And I do \\nthink that's capital. But again, we do it, remember, for clients. So we are large market makers on both sides of the ma rkets for clients in both \\ncredit and treasuries, which is a little different than some of the other people just trading for their own account. And so t hey are both \\ncompetition from our standpoint, but we're there. We're going to do it. We're can always dep loy more capital if we want. And we would even \\ndeploy more capital at lower returns if we really had to do that to service clients. So we're very conscious of it. There wil l be competition both \\nsides. As Jeremy said, we sat here 10 years ago talking about the electronification of the business and can we keep up with that, and so far \\nwe have.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nEbrahim H. Poonawala  \\nAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Q \\nGot it. And just one quick one. And, Jeremy, you, I think, mentioned QT stopping at some point. We saw the repo sort of marke t spike at the \\nend of September. Give us your perspective on just the risk of market liquidity shock as we move into year -end and d o you have a view on \\nhow quickly Fed should recalibrate QT or actually stop QT to prevent some loss? Thanks.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\n \\n \\n14 \\n \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. It's a good question, Ebrahim. But I think you've kind of answered your own question. In other words, like the argument out there is that \\nthe repo spike that we saw at the end of this quarter was an indication that maybe the market is approaching that lowest comf ortable level of \\nreserves that's been heavily speculated about. And recognizing that that numbe r is probably higher and driven by the evolution of firm's \\nliquidity requirements as opposed to some of the more traditional measures.  \\n \\nAnd side point, it's just another reason why it's important to look at the whole framework holistically when we think about t he regulatory \\nresponse of the events of two springs ago. You don't want those types of spikes and it raises some questions about wh y there isn't more \\nreadiness to deploy into those types of disruptions, albeit this one was relatively minor.  \\n \\nBut in any case, when you put all that together, it would seem to add some weight to the notion that maybe QT should be wound  down and \\nthat seems to be increasingly the consensus that that's going to get announced at some point in the fourth quarter. So my  only point was if you \\nplay that view through, it's a residual headwind for system -wide deposit growth which gets removed. And that's one of the reasons that we feel \\nthat we're probably in the trough of our deposit balances at the level of...  \\n............................................................................................................................. ....................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nSo I just want to add a couple policy things here. I'm not actually sure they can actually do that, because you have inflatio nary factors out \\nthere, partially driven by QE. And also, look at the volatility. It's not a risk to JPMorgan. It's a risk to the system. And what banks have, I \\nalready mentioned the constrained balance sheet a little bit. So the banks will have trillions of dollars of cash and unable to deploy the repo \\nmarkets. And is it a good policy thing that every ti me that happens, because you can do it very safely, fully collateralized, all things like that, \\nproviding what I call flexible financing in the marketplace, that that happens, the Fed has to step in every time? I think th at becomes a policy \\nissue that ever y time there's some kind of fluctuation in the market, people panic and the Fed has got to step in and provide stuff. And can  \\nthey always do that if you have a slightly more inflationary environment going forward?  \\n \\nSo I think you've got to be very thoughtful about this and that's why we do think they should look at calibrating SLR and ECL R and CET1, all of \\nthese things, particularly for this. So my view is, it is going to happen again. I can't tell you exactly when, but I'd be surprised if it doesn't \\nhappen again.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nEbrahim H. Poonawala  \\nAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Q \\nGot it. Thank you both.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\nOperator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nBetsy L. Graseck  \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nOh, hi. Good morning.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nHey, Betsy.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nBetsy L. Graseck  \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nCan you hear me? Hello?  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\n \\n15 \\n \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah.  \\n............................................................................................................................. ....................................................................................................  \\nBetsy L. Graseck  \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nCan you hear me okay?  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. We can hear you. Can you hear us?  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nBetsy L. Graseck  \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nOh, yes. Thank you. So one for Jeremy, one for Jamie. Jeremy and Jamie, Sorry about the NII question I'm going to have, but i t is more than \\nhalf your revenue so I kind of care about it.  \\n \\nBut when I'm thinking about the trough and then the build -up, QT ending, deposit growth, I mean, that's part of the calculation for improvement \\nas we go into 2025. Right? I should embed that outlook. Is that right? And that's embedded in how you're thinkin g about it. I know we don't \\nhave a number for you for NII for 2025 but it is in there. Right?  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. In other words, it goes back to my prior point and to the point that I had in the prepared remarks about the consumer d eposit balances \\nin particular – \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nBetsy L. Graseck  \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nRight.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\n– that there's lots of different offsetting factors right now, right. You've got the yield curve, you've got Card revolve, you' ve got balances. And \\nbalances have been a headwind. We now see it as neutral and they could potentially become a tailwind later in the year. And one of the \\npotential reasons for that is – one of the potential reasons for that is the potential end of QT, but emphasize the word potential, to Jamie's \\npoint.  \\n \\nYou also obviously have a little bit of the fixed asset, fixed -rate asset reprice dynamics starting to flow through a little bit. While we're on NII, \\njust to annoy Jamie a little bit more, I do want to make a point that I didn't get a chance to make previo usly, which is there's a reason that we \\nemphasize the implied fourth quarter run rate for the Markets NII in the presentation which is that if you take that and you annualize it, it gives \\nyou a launch point run rate, which is significantly higher than what 's currently in the consensus and obviously what we've seen this year. And \\nI'll give you the concise version of my usual speech that changes in Markets NII are almost always bottom -line neutral and offset in NIR. But \\nfor the purposes of trying to help you guys with your models, I would just encourage you to recognize what that launch point is, the number of \\ncuts that are in the curve, the fact that that number has historically and in the recent past has been quite liability -sensitive, so you can draw \\nyour o wn conclusions about what that should mean. Again, shouldn't change the overall revenue expectation. It's just a balance shee t and \\nincome statement geography issue. But just for the sake of helping you tidy up models, I wanted to make that point.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\n \\n \\n16 \\n \\nBetsy L. Graseck  \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nAnd so Daniel's comments in September were on NII in total or NII ex. Markets? Could you just clarify that?  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nNo. Those were core NII or NII ex.. So again, reiterating at the time, the 2024 consensus was $91.5 billion. The 2025 consens us was $90 \\nbillion on NII ex. and our point was that that number, which remains an asset -sensitive number, indicated an insufficien t amount of sequential \\ndecline year -on-year. The current consensus as we see it for NII ex. Markets is $87 billion. And as we've noted, that's closer albeit maybe s till \\na little bit toppy.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nBetsy L. Graseck  \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nOkay. Then one for Jamie. Jamie, we did talk already quite a bit about the capital that you have, capital in store. Just want ed to understand \\nhow you're thinking about that opportunity set that's in front of you with regard to using it for potentially portfolio acquisitions. I realize that \\ndepositories are not on the docket, but we all know there's portfolios out there that might be looking for a home. And  could you give us a sense \\nas to how interested you might be in acquiring assets at this stage?  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nYeah. So asset acquisitions, I mean I always want our people to be looking at those things and thinking about those things. B ut if you listen to \\nwhat I'm saying about my caution about the world, it's hard for me to say that we're going to be in the market to buy credit assets.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nBetsy L. Graseck  \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nWhat about loans? The Apple card…  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nBut creating those assets to help clients. That's a whole different matter because when it comes to clients, we earn credit a sset spread and we \\nusually have other stuff. If our bankers can deploy capital that way, of course be that we want to do more. And our CIO could deploy capital in \\nmultiple ways, we would probably do more. And we ask all the time can we do more in affordable housing, can we do more in thi ngs we're \\nactually quite comfortable. And yeah, if we could find ways to deplo y capital, we would be happy to do that. But put us in your closest \\ncategory...  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nBetsy L. Graseck  \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nAnd what about like a private label credit card, for example.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\n[indiscernible]  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nBetsy L. Graseck  \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nI'm just wondering about private label credit card for example. Is that something that would help clients?  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\n17 \\n \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nAlmost no chance.  \\n \\nWell, but having – it's very important. While I say that, I always tell the management team second -guess me. I mean, we’ve done private label. \\nI know what it is, we've been there. I have a lot of issues with it. But is it possible it's going to be different one day an d a different thing? Yeah, \\nit's possible, so I don't want to cut  it off. If Marianne Lake says to me, Jamie I think clearly the world's changed, we're going to change. But \\nright now, we'd say no, there's no chance.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nBetsy L. Graseck  \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nThank you so much.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\n \\nOperator : Thank you. Our final question will come from Saul Martinez with HSBC. Your line is open.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nSaul Martinez  \\nAnalyst, HSBC Securities (USA), Inc . Q \\nHey. Good morning. I'm not going to ask about a specific NII in 2025, but I did want to delve into the how to think about you r deposit margin in \\nvolume dynamics in the CCB over the next few years. You have seen a decent amount of pressure in the deposit ma rgin, 2.6%, down about \\n30 basis points as deposit balances have come down, so it put some pressure on deposit NII. But deposit margins are still wel l above where \\nthey were when rates were at levels that are consistent with where the forward curve now has b een going. So I guess how do we think about \\nboth volumes and margin dynamics if rates do come down, say, to the level that are consistent with the forward curve? I know the forward \\ncurve is likely going to be long, but that's the reference point we have.  \\n \\nAnd conversely, volume offset. You mentioned, Jeremy, the retail deposits becoming a tailwind. But, I guess, how much of a ta ilwind could \\nthey be, especially as you are expecting to gain quite a bit of market share in retail deposits? So just give us a sen se of sort of the push and \\npull of these dynamics that really help drive the deposit, the value of the deposit franchise.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nSure. Yeah, thanks for the question, Saul. And I think you've laid out the building blocks there already. Just for simplicity , I'm going to try to \\nanswer your question without referring to the disclosed CCB deposit margin number, just because that number i s obviously the combination of \\nthe rate paid on the CCB deposits and the internal FTP into that. And that is a complicated thing that evolves as a function of the modeling of \\nthe betas and other things. So I think it's actually more helpful to look at this  simply from a Firmwide perspective and look at the evolution of \\nthe rate paid in the context of the policy rates roughly, and just set aside the duration management and all those sort of fa ctors.  \\n \\nAnd I think when you do that, what you see is we've been saying for a while that the deposit margin defined for these purpose s is simply the \\ndifference between the policy rate and the weighted -average rate paid of the consumer deposits, was unsustainably h igh. And that was going \\nto have to correct one way or the other. Either deposits were going to reprice at the product level through checking and savi ngs, and/or we \\nwere going to see a ton of internal migration, i.e. growth in the CD mix, and/or we would se e a lower policy rate. So as we sit here right now, of \\ncourse, we make pricing decisions in the context of market competition at any given moment looking at what the environment is  for deposits, \\nbut we have not needed to reprice in order to retain primary bank relationships which was also our core strategy. We were never going to \\nchase sort of the hot money at the margin.  \\n \\nWe've leaned in heavily to CDs and gotten to the current level of CD mix, and that's been a good strategy. And from where we sit now, we \\nnow have the margin coming down as a result of the policy rate coming down. It seems that, that puts us in a pretty com fortable position from \\na pricing perspective. We think the CD mix has probably peaked.  \\n \\nNow, on the way down, it's not going to go back down to zero, where it was at the beginning of the cycle. That's an important  thing to realize. \\nSo all else equal, that creates a little bit of margin compression. And then through all of that, obviously, a l ower yield environment should mean \\nthat there's a little bit less outflow from consumer deposits, as I mentioned. We're seeing a lot less yield -seeking behavior. So then when you \\noverlay on to that what you mentioned, which is our long -term share growth in  CCB deposits, in no small part as a function of the brand \\nstrategy and the buildout and the fact that only about a quarter of our top 125 markets in CCB are at that 15% share number, so we believe \\nthere's big opportunity to grow the rest of it and be on t rack at the type of average annual share growth of the order of 30 basis points or 40  \\n \\n18 \\n \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief  Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nbasis points that we've seen historically. That's how you kind of assemble a tailwind from normalized deposit margin and bala nce growth in \\nConsumer.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nJeremy, correct me if you think I'm wrong. The abnormal time period was when rates were between 0% and 1% or 2%. Other than that, if \\nyou're looking at, say, what are normal deposit margins in the normal banking business, forget people going after really hot money if that \\nhappens, it's 2% to 2.5%.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nAbsolutely. Yeah, we agree.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nSaul Martinez  \\nAnalyst, HSBC Securities (USA), Inc . Q \\nOkay. That's helpful. So it sounds like you're a little bit above that, but there's still some pressure. But you're not dramatically above those \\nlevels.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJamie Dimon  \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \\nVery good returns in business in both Banking & Wealth Management. We're growing market share. And when we build branches and  stuff \\nlike that, we don't necessarily assume current margins. We look at what would be normal margins over time. And we're very co mfortable doing \\nvery nice business for you all.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nSaul Martinez  \\nAnalyst, HSBC Securities (USA), Inc . Q \\nYes. Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Thanks a lot. That's all I got.  \\n............................................................................................................................. .....................................................................................................  \\nJeremy Barnum  \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Welcome to JPMorganChase\\'s Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. \\nYour line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. The presentation is available on JPMorganChase\\'s \\nwebsite. Please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward-looking statements. Please stand by. \\n \\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorganChase\\'s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. \\nMr. Barnum, please go ahead. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase \\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $14 billion, EPS of $4.81 on revenue of $43.7 \\nbillion, with an ROTCE of 21%. On page 2, we have more on our fourth-quarter results. The Firm reported revenue of $43.7 billion, up $3.8 billion \\nor 10% year-on-year. NII ex. Markets was down $548 million or 2%, driven by the impact of lower rates and the associated deposit margin \\ncompression, as well as lower deposit balances in CCB, largely offset by the impact of securities reinvestment, higher revolving balances in \\nCard and higher wholesale deposit balances. NIR ex. Markets was up $3.1 billion or 30%. Excluding the prior year\\'s net investment securities \\nlosses, it was up 21%, largely on higher asset management fees and investment banking fees. And Markets revenue was up $1.2 billion or 21%. \\n \\nExpenses of $22.8 billion were down $1.7 billion or 7% year-on-year. Excluding the prior year\\'s FDIC special assessment, expenses were up $1.2 \\nbillion or 5%, predominantly driven by compensation as well as higher brokerage and distribution fees. And credit costs were $2.6 billion, \\nreflecting net charge-offs of $2.4 billion and a net reserve of $267 million. On page 3, you can see the reported results for the full year. I\\'ll \\nremind you that there were a number of significant items in 2024. Excluding those items, the Firm reported net income of $54 billion, EPS of \\n$18.22, revenue of $173 billion, and we delivered an ROTCE of 20%. Touching on a couple of highlights for the year. In CCB, we had a record \\nnumber of first-time investors and acquired nearly 10 million new card accounts. In CIB, we had record revenue in Markets, Payments and \\nSecurities Services. And in AWM, we had record long-term net inflows of $234 billion, positive across all channels, regions and asset classes. \\n \\nOn to balance sheet and capital on page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15.7%, up 40 basis points versus the prior quarter, as net \\nincome and lower RWA were largely offset by both OCI losses and capital distributions, which included $4 billion of net common share \\nrepurchases this quarter. The $24 billion decrease in RWA reflects a seasonal decline in Markets activity and lower wholesale lending, which \\nwas predominantly offset by a seasonal increase in Card. Now, let\\'s go to our businesses starting with CCB on page 5.  \\n \\nCCB reported net income of $4.5 billion on revenue of $18.4 billion, which was up 1% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue \\nwas down 7% year-on-year on deposit margin compression and lower deposits, partially offset by growth in Wealth Management revenues. \\nAverage deposits were down 4% year-on-year and flat sequentially as consumer balances have stabilized. Client investment assets were up \\n14% year-on-year, predominantly driven by market performance, and we continue to see healthy flows across branch and digital channels. In \\nHome Lending, revenue was up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher production revenue. Turning to Card Services & Auto, \\nrevenue was up 14% year-on-year, largely driven by Card NII on higher revolving balances. Card outstandings were up 11% due to strong \\naccount acquisition and revolve growth. And in Auto, originations were $10.6 billion, up 7%, reflecting higher lease volume on robust new \\nvehicle inventory. \\n \\nExpenses of $9.7 billion were up 4% year-on-year, predominantly driven by field compensation and growth in technology. In terms of credit \\nperformance this quarter, credit costs were $2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.1 billion, up $428 million year-on-year, driven by Card. \\nThe net reserve build was $557 million, predominantly driven by higher Card revolving balances. \\n \\nNext, the Commercial & Investment Bank on page 6. CIB reported net income of $6.6 billion on revenue of $17.6 billion. IB fees were up 49% \\nyear-on-year, and we ranked number 1 with wallet share of 9.3% for 2024. Advisory fees were up 41%, benefiting from large deals and share \\ngrowth in a number of key sectors. Underwriting fees were up meaningfully with debt up 56% and equity up 54%, primarily driven by favorable \\nmarket conditions. In terms of the outlook for the overall investment banking wallet, in light of the positive momentum, we remain optimistic \\nabout our pipeline. Payments revenue was $4.7 billion, up 3% year-on-year, excluding equity investments, driven by higher deposit balances \\nand fee growth and largely offset by deposit margin compression. Lending revenue was $1.9 billion, up 9% year-on-year, predominantly driven \\nby lower losses on hedges. \\n \\n \\n \\n  2 \\nMoving to Markets, total revenue was $7 billion, up 21% year-on-year. Fixed Income was up 20% with better performance in Credit as well as \\ncontinued outperformance in Currencies & Emerging Markets. Equities was up 22% on elevated client activity and Derivatives amid increased \\nvolatility and higher trading volumes in Cash. Securities Services revenue was $1.3 billion, up 10% year-on-year, driven by fee growth on higher \\nclient activity and market levels, as well as higher deposit balances. Expenses of $8.7 billion were up 7% year-on-year, predominantly driven by \\nhigher brokerage, technology and legal expense. Average Banking & Payments loans were down 2% year-on-year and down 1% sequentially. \\nGlobal Corporate & Investment Banking loans were down 2% quarter-on-quarter, driven by paydowns and lower short-term financing, \\nprimarily offset by new originations. \\n \\nIn Commercial Banking, Middle Market loans were also down 2% driven by paydowns, predominantly offset by new originations. And \\nCommercial Real Estate loans were flat as new originations were offset by paydowns. Average client deposits were up 9% year-on-year and 5% \\nsequentially, driven by underlying client growth. Finally, credit costs were $61 million driven by net downgrade activity and the net impact of \\ncharge-offs, largely offset by a reserve release due to an update to certain loss assumptions. Then, to complete our lines of business, Asset & \\nWealth Management on page 7.  \\n \\nAWM reported net income of $1.5 billion with pre-tax margin of 35%. Revenue of $5.8 billion was up 13% year-on-year, predominantly driven by \\ngrowth in management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows, as well as higher performance fees. Expenses of $3.8 \\nbillion were up 11% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation and continued \\ngrowth in our private banking advisor teams as well as higher distribution fees. Long-term net inflows were $76 billion for the quarter, positive \\nacross all asset classes. In liquidity, we saw net inflows of $94 billion for the quarter and $140 billion for the full year. And we had client asset \\nnet inflows of $468 billion for the year. AUM of $4 trillion and client assets of $5.9 trillion were both up 18% year-on-year driven by continued \\nnet inflows and higher market levels. And finally, loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter and deposits were up 5% quarter-on-quarter. Turning to \\nCorporate on page 8.  \\n \\nCorporate reported net income of $1.3 billion. Revenue of $2 billion was up $223 million year-on-year. NII of $2 billion was down $415 million \\nyear-on-year, driven by the impact of lower rates, largely offset by balance sheet actions, primarily securities reinvestment activity. NIR was a \\nnet loss of $30 million, compared with a net loss of $668 million in the prior year, driven by lower net investment securities losses this quarter. \\nAnd expenses of $550 million were down $3 billion year-on-year, predominantly driven by the absence of the FDIC special assessment of $2.9 \\nbillion in the prior year. With that, let\\'s pivot to the outlook, starting with NII on page 9.  \\n \\nWe expect 2025 NII ex. Markets to be approximately $90 billion. Going through the drivers, as usual, the outlook assumes that rates follow the \\nforward curve. It\\'s worth noting that the NII decrease is driven by both the cut expected in 2025 and the impact of the 100 basis points of cuts \\nin the back half of 2024. You can see on the page that we\\'ve illustrated the historical trajectory of Card loan growth. We expect healthy Card \\nloan growth again this year, but below the 12% pace we saw in 2024 as tailwinds from revolve normalization are largely behind us. Turning to \\ndeposits, Firmwide deposits have stabilized and we expect to see a more visible growth trend assert itself in the second half of 2025. It\\'s \\nnotable that we can already see that trend in consumer checking deposits. On deposit margin, we expect modest compression due to lower \\nrates. When you put all that together, we expect the NII trough could be sometime in the middle of the year, followed by growth as we \\nillustrated at the bottom of the bar. And for completeness, we expect Firmwide NII to be approximately $94 billion as a function of Markets NII \\nincreasing to about $4 billion, which you should think of as being primarily offset in NIR. \\n \\nFinally, I want to point out that starting this quarter, we are including an estimate of earnings-at-risk in the earnings supplement so you no \\nlonger have to wait for the K or the Q to get that number. Now, let\\'s turn to expenses on page 10. We expect 2025 (sic) [adjusted] expense to be \\nabout $95 billion. Looking at the chart in the middle of the page, I\\'ll touch on the drivers of the year-on-year change, which you\\'ll note are very \\nconsistent with what you\\'ve been hearing from us recently. The largest increase is volume-and revenue-related expense, which is primarily \\ndriven by expected growth in Auto leasing, as well as capital markets. As a reminder, this comes with higher revenues. We continue to hire \\nbankers and advisors to support business growth as well as expand our branch network. The increase in tech spend is primarily business \\ndriven as we continue to invest in new products, features and customer platforms, as well as modernization. Marketing remains a driver of \\nspend as we continue to see attractive opportunities, resulting in strong demand and engagement in our Card business. And finally, while we \\nhaven\\'t explicitly called it out in each bar, inflation remains a source of some upward pressure. And as always, we are generating efficiencies to \\nhelp offset it. Now let\\'s turn to page 11 to cover credit and wrap up.  \\n \\nOn credit, we expect the 2025 Card net charge-off rate to be in line with our previous guidance of approximately 3.6%. So in closing, 2024 was \\nanother year of record revenue and net income, and we\\'re proud of what we accomplished. As we look ahead to 2025, we still expect NII \\nnormalization, although to a lesser extent than we previously thought. And taking a step back, we think it\\'s important to acknowledge the \\ntension between the risks and uncertainties in the environment and the degree of optimism embedded in asset prices and expectations. In that \\ncontext, we remain upbeat about the strength of the franchise, but we are focused on being prepared for a wide range of scenarios.  \\n \\n \\n  3 \\n \\nFinally, let me say a few words about the wildfires in Los Angeles. While we don\\'t expect much of a financial impact from it, we have a presence \\nin the area across all three lines of business, so we\\'re keeping in close contact with our customers, clients and employees. We are offering \\nsupport in a variety of ways, including waiving consumer and business banking fees as well as making a contribution to local relief \\norganizations, offering employee donation matching and supporting employee volunteer efforts. \\n \\nWith that, I\\'ll turn it over to Jamie before we open up the line for Q&A. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase \\nGood morning, everybody. I just want to point out that Daniel Pinto is not leaving the company yet, so it\\'s a bit premature what I\\'m about to do. I \\njust wanted to say and I\\'d be remiss not to say, he was a young man who joined the company at 20 years old in Argentina. He ran trading in \\nArgentina, then he ran trading for Latin America, then he ran global emerging markets trading, then he ran fixed income trading and then \\nbecame co-head of the Investment Bank and then sole head of the Investment Bank for 10 years. Over that whole time, helped me build one of \\nthe great investment banks in the world. And then, obviously, was President for five years or more; a great partner of mine, trusted by everyone \\nat the company. So we\\'re thrilled to have his skills and talents going forward, but I just wanted to recognize the contributions he made. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase \\nGreat. All right. So let\\'s go to questions. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nQUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION \\n \\nOperator : Thank you. Please stand by. Our first question comes from John McDonald with Truist Securities. You may proceed. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJohn McDonald \\nAnalyst, Truist Securities, Inc. Q \\nHi. Good morning. Jeremy, I wanted to ask about capital, and I know you get this question a lot about the kind of high-class dilemma of your \\ngrowing capital base and your perspective of that as earnings in store. So, I guess, what\\'s the framework for thinking about the opportunity \\ncost of sitting on the growing base of capital and how high you might let that go versus your patience in waiting for more attractive deployment \\nopportunities? \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase  A \\nYeah. Good question, John, and welcome back, by the way. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \\nJohn McDonald \\nAnalyst, Truist Securities, Inc.  Q \\nThank you. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nWelcome back, John. Read your piece the other day. It took me quite a while, but it was good work. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\n \\n \\n  4 \\nJohn McDonald \\nAnalyst, Truist Securities, Inc  Q \\nThanks. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nSo, yeah, you\\'ve noted all the points that we always make so I won\\'t repeat them. And I think the way we\\'re thinking about it right now is that we \\nfeel very comfortable with the notion that it makes sense for us to have a nice store of extra capital in light of the current environment. We \\nbelieve there\\'s a good chance that there will be a moment where we get to deploy it at better levels essentially in whatever way than the current \\nopportunities would suggest. And so that feels like a correct kind of strategic and financial decision for us. Having said that, having studied it \\nquite extensively over the last six months and have all the debates that you would expect, we\\'ve concluded that we do have enough. We have \\nenough excess. And given that, we would like to not have the excess grow from here. \\n \\nSo, when you think about the implications of that, given the amount of organic capital generation that we\\'re producing, it means that unless we \\nfind in the near term opportunities for organic deployment or otherwise, it means more capital return through buybacks, all else being equal, in \\norder to arrest the growth of the excess. And that is our current plan, although, I\\'ll give the caveat that, as you know, is in our disclosure, which \\nis we don\\'t want to get in the business of guiding on buybacks, and we reserve the right to change the trajectory at any time for any reason, but \\nthat is our current thinking. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJohn McDonald \\nAnalyst, Truist Securities, Inc  Q \\nOkay. Thanks, Jeremy. And then just as a follow-up, when we think about the investment spend agenda this year, how does it differ from, say, \\nlast year or last couple of years across lines of business in this kind of certainty of return spectrum you\\'ve talked about? And then what kind of \\nefficiencies are baked into the outlook as well? Thanks. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nSure. The truth is – and I guess this is a good thing that the themes are remarkably consistent. So, we are seeing the results of our kind of high \\ncertainty investment choices across all the categories that you know very well and that we highlighted on the outlook page for expenses, and \\nthose continue to be the main areas of focus. The execution gets tweaked at the margin as we pursue different opportunities in the \\nCommercial & Investment Bank. We continue drilling down and analyzing into the relative pockets of weakness that you might see if you go a \\nlevel or two below the very significantly strong share positions that you see on an aggregate level. Daniel always talked about the reds and the \\nambers that are behind the greens, and that\\'s embedded in the culture of the company. So we do that everywhere and continue analyzing and \\niterating, and we throw resources against that stuff as we do that. But, broadly, the themes are very consistent. \\n \\nI think, in terms of efficiency, a couple of things to say, which you know well. One is, when we think about efficiency and how we generate it at \\nthis company, it\\'s organic, it\\'s BAU, it\\'s evergreen; it happens every day in all the teams, everywhere. And so that is sort of part of the bottoms-\\nup culture, and that remains the case. We do have a few top-down areas of focus. I think if I go, for example, into technology for starters, we\\'re \\nputting a lot of effort into improving the sort of ability of our software engineers to be productive as they do development, and there\\'s been a \\nlot of focus on that – the development environment for them, in order to enable them to be more productive. And so all else equal, that \\ngenerates a little bit of efficiency. We also have a lot of focus on the efficiency of our hardware utilization. And so that\\'s embedded in there as \\nwell. \\n \\nAnd another thing that\\'s worth noting, you\\'ll recall that, at Investor Day, I talked about how we had probably reached peak modernization \\nspend. As Jamie always says, we\\'re always modernizing. So, the fact that we\\'ve gotten to a peak and then it might come down a little bit from \\nhere still means we\\'re going to be constantly modernizing. But, at the margin, that means that inside the tech teams, there\\'s a little bit of \\ncapacity that gets freed up to focus on features and new product development and so on, which is also in some sense a form of efficiency.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  5 \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nFinally, though, what I would say is that if you look at the head count trajectory of the company over the last few years, we have grown a lot and \\nit has been for very good reasons. And it has contributed quite a bit to our growth and to our ability to run the company efficiently. \\n \\nBut any time you have that quantum of headcount growth as well as that rate of headcount growth, you have to believe, all else equal, that \\nsome amount of inefficiency has been introduced. And so, this year, as we went through the budget cycle, we ask people, at the margin, to try \\nto support the growth of the company while living within their means on the headcount front. So we\\'re going to try to run things, with some \\nimportant exceptions that I\\'ll highlight in a second, on roughly flat head count and have that lead to people generating internal efficiencies as \\nthey get creative with their teams, and we consider more efficient ways of doing things. The obvious exceptions are the ongoing areas of high \\ncertainty investment and growth, so, obviously, branches and bankers and so on. And also, critical non-negotiable areas of risk and control like \\ncyber or whatever independent risk management needs to ensure that we\\'re running the company safely. So that\\'s how we\\'re thinking about \\nefficiency in the current moment. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJohn McDonald \\nAnalyst, Truist Securities, Inc.  Q \\nVery helpful. Thank you. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nEfficiently said. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nOperator : Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nMike Mayo \\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC  Q \\nHi. Simple and then more difficult, I guess. Jamie, who\\'s your successor? And then the second question is, I know I asked the question at \\nInvestor Day, why not stay as CEO a little bit longer? I think what I\\'m hearing from investors now, it goes up and down, but I think investors \\nwould like you to stay. So, why say you\\'re going to stay less than five years? You\\'re finally getting what you wanted, 15 years, your spaghetti \\nchart about the regulatory structure and the unpredictability of capital requirements and regulatory costs, and it seems like you\\'re finally \\ngetting what you\\'ve been playing for. So, why not stay around a bit longer if investors want you to do so? And what would you do otherwise \\nanyway? You don\\'t play golf. You aren\\'t going to be Treasury Secretary. Seems like your work is your hobby, right? So how much longer would \\nyou stay around? \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nI do love what I do. And answering the second question first, look, we\\'re on a path. The path is not just about me, it\\'s about the other senior \\npeople in the company. It\\'s about the Board. If I\\'m here for several more years, and I may or may not be Chairman. That\\'s going to be up to the \\nBoard. Does it really fit the new CEO and stuff like that? You\\'re talking potentially four, five years or more. I\\'ll be 69 in March. I think it\\'s the \\nrational thing to do. I\\'ve had a couple health problems, you know. I just think it makes a lot of sense, and so – and what was your first question \\nagain? \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\n \\n \\n \\n  6 \\nMike Mayo \\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC  Q \\nWho\\'s your successor? \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nOh, yeah. This is an unfortunate thing for any big company like this where these people have to be in the spotlight all the time and always to-ing \\nand fro-ing. We have several exceptional people. You guys know most of them. There\\'s maybe one or two you don\\'t know. The Board reviews \\nand meets with them all the time. I think it\\'s wonderful that Jenn Piepszak, who does not want to be the CEO, will be here as Chief Operating \\nOfficer and stay after that. So, obviously, she\\'s going to work with those people which I think is great for a company, just having continuity of \\nmanagement and leadership, and will be one of those people. And obviously, we\\'re not going to tell the press, but it\\'s not determined yet. And \\nof course, the last minute, a couple years from now people get sick, they change their mind, have family circumstances. So, even if you thought \\nyou knew today, you couldn\\'t be completely sure. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nMike Mayo \\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC  Q \\nSo, you\\'ll stay around maybe for a few more years base case right now? \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nBasic case, yeah. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nMike Mayo \\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC  Q \\nAll right. Thank you. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nOperator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. You may proceed. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJim Mitchell \\nAnalyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC  Q \\nHey. Good morning. Maybe just on regulation, we have a new administration coming in. We have a new, soon-to-be, I guess, a new head of \\nregulation at the Fed. So, maybe just talk about, again, what areas of the regulatory structure, if it were to change, would be most impactful for \\nyou. And is there any areas where you think capital requirements could actually go down? Or is this more of a story of requirements just simply \\nstop going up? Thanks. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nHey, Jim. I mean, it\\'s obviously something we\\'re thinking about a lot. But I could go down some pretty deep rabbit holes speculating on all the \\ndifferent parts of the framework and how they could evolve, and I just don\\'t really think that\\'s productive right now. But let me make some \\nattempt to answer your question. So, backing up a second, if you read Jamie\\'s quotes, they\\'re very consistent with what we\\'ve been saying as a \\ncompany for a long time, which is that all we want is a coherent, rational, holistically-assessed regulatory framework that allows banks to do  \\ntheir job, supporting the economy, that isn\\'t reflexively anti-bank, that doesn\\'t default to the answer to every question being more of  \\n \\n \\n  7 \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\neverything, more capital, more liquidity, that uses data and that balances the obvious goal that we all share of a safe and sound banking system \\nwith actually recognizing that banks play a critical role in supporting growth, and the hope is that we get some of that. \\n \\nAnd that also, while we\\'re at it, some aspects of the supervisory framework get a little bit less bureaucratic and a little less adversarial and a \\nlittle bit more substantive so that at the margin, management can focus its time on the things that matter the most. So, whether capital goes  \\nup, down, stays flat is really so complicated because it\\'s not just Basel III Endgame, it\\'s also a G-SIB, it\\'s also a number of other factors. And \\nthat\\'s why we keep hammering away on the importance of doing all of this holistically, properly with the right analysis. And if that takes time, so \\nbe it. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nCan I just add, no that\\'s great. Jeremy gave it all. Let me add three quick things. Liquidity is also equally important. There\\'s been a lot of \\nrecognition that what counts as liquidity and discount windows and how LCR is done I think is very important. Second is competition. All these \\nthings should be done in light of looking at what kind of public markets you want, what kind of private markets you want, what do you want in \\nthe banking system, what you want out of the banking system. And the third is I think most people realize there is a huge need to take a step \\nback and look at the Byzantine, Balkanized system we built which has negatives, and even the regulators will tell you that. So, at one point, just \\ntake a deep breath. As Jeremy said, let\\'s do the right thing and continue to have the best financial system in the world. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJim Mitchell \\nAnalyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC  Q \\nYeah. No, that makes sense. And maybe just as a follow-up, just on loan growth. Have you – since the election, it seems like CEO confidence, \\nbusiness confidence has increased. So, are you starting to see any improvement in demand on lending? Just any thoughts there would be \\ngreat. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nYeah, it\\'s a good question. And I think given the significant improvement in business sentiment and the general optimism out there, you might \\nhave expected to see some pickup in loan growth. We are not really seeing that. I don\\'t particularly think that\\'s a negative. I think it\\'s probably \\nexplained by a combination of wide-open capital markets, and so many of the larger corporates accessing the capital markets and healthy \\nbalance sheets in small businesses and maybe some residual caution. And maybe there are some pockets and some industries where some \\naspects of the policy uncertainty that we might be facing are making them a little bit more cautious than they otherwise would be about what \\nthey\\'re executing in the near-term. But, we\\'ll see what the new year brings as the current optimism starts getting tested with reality, one way or \\nthe other. \\n \\nAnd maybe if it materializes with tangible improvements and things one way or the other, you\\'ll actually see that come through C&I loan growth \\nin particular. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJim Mitchell \\nAnalyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC  Q \\nOkay. Great. Thanks. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nOperator : Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. Your line is open. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\n \\n \\n  8 \\nErika Najarian \\nAnalyst, UBS Securities LLC  Q \\nYes. Hi, good morning. Wanted to follow up on the questions on capital and maybe ask about some of, Jeremy, the crosscurrents in terms of \\nthe denominator. So, if we look at the third quarter regulatory data for your G-SIB surcharge score, that would imply that your score would put \\nyou in a range of a 5% G-SIB. So, obviously, from what we understand, if you print that – somewhere near that score at the end of this year, then \\nyour G-SIB surcharge goes up by – to 5% or by 50 basis points two years and one day from now. At the same time, around the holidays, we did \\nget the press release from both the Federal Reserve and the lawsuit from the banks. In terms of the transparency, it looks like the transparency \\nis going to be focused on perhaps being improved as soon as this year\\'s stress test. \\n \\nSo, as we think about the definition of excess, right, because part of this is like 15.7% is clearly a huge number. So, as we think about your \\nreturns going forward, the definition of excess also continues to shift. So, how should we think about those crosscurrents in terms of two big \\ncomponents, clearly, one is your G-SIB surcharge and the other is your stress capital buffer? \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nRight, Erika. Okay. You are tempting me with many rabbit holes that are very deep. But let\\'s try and address this not too much great length.  \\nFirst of all, G-SIB. So, yes, it was a high print in the third quarter, but we had normal seasonality third quarter and fourth quarter. So, while our  \\ncurrent view of G-SIB number is an estimate, we\\'re quite confident that we wound up comfortably in the 5% bucket just as a result of normal  \\nseasonality. It was actually a relatively quiet December in terms of the types of year-end things that sometimes create pressures of various \\ntypes. So that is more or less what you might have otherwise expected in terms of our typical seasonal patterns. So, not much to see there. \\n \\nAnd the obvious point also being that even under the existing proposed G-SIB rule, which is obviously a little bit hung up, with the smaller \\nbuckets and some of the recalibration and so on, it\\'s not even sort of obvious that it would have mattered one way or the other. But, anyway, for \\nnow, we\\'re managing to the current rules, and normal seasonality took us back under 5%. Okay, you mentioned the lawsuit. I think the only \\nthing to say about that is that we are happy to see the clear recognition on the part of the Fed that many of the things that we\\'ve been talking \\nabout for a long time in terms of transparency and volatility, and some of the non-substantive bureaucratic burden associated with the CCAR \\nprocess needs improvement. So, that\\'s great. \\n \\nI think I won\\'t speak for the industry bodies that were the actual litigants, but it seems to me, if you just read what they said publicly in their \\npress releases, this is as much as anything about preserving rights in light of the statute of limitations deadlines that were coming up. So, let\\'s \\njust hope that we see some significant progress on that front. And then, taking a step back, at a high level, what you\\'re really asking me is, what \\nis our core view about, and I think probably the best way to think about this is just through the lens of the numerator, actually. What is our core \\nview about if you just, for the sake of argument, assume modest growth in the normalized amount of economic denominator, like actual need \\nfor capital organically, what will be the likely additional numerator that will be needed or not as a function of the environment. \\n \\nAnd the way we\\'re increasingly thinking about that is just doing different scenario analysis of like flat numerator, up 5% numerator, up 10% \\nnumerator, up 20% numerator. I guess there could be some versions of the world where the numerator\\'s a little less. And then guessing about \\nour central case and comparing our projected capital amount to that number to determine the excess. And as you point out, at 15.7%, and I \\nthink the actual quantum of the numerator is something like $275 billion, through pretty much any reasonable lens, it\\'s a ton of excess, which is \\nwhy we\\'ve concluded that it doesn\\'t need to grow anymore. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nErika Najarian \\nAnalyst, UBS Securities LLC  Q \\nAnd just a follow-up question – a follow-up to John\\'s line of questioning. As a placeholder, as we think about what you said, trying to arrest the \\ngrowth of CET1, for now, should we just assume that anything that you don\\'t need for organic growth and your dividend obligations in terms of \\nthat 15.7% will be bought back by the company as we think about? I know you don\\'t want to predict the buyback, but is that sort of just a \\nplaceholder for now as we think about what can return back to shareholders in the form of repurchase? \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\n \\n \\n  9 \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nYeah. You\\'ve quoted our capital hierarchy, and your conclusion flows naturally from my statement that we do want to arrest the growth of the \\nexcess. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nSo, we are never going to tell the market what we\\'re going to do. You all know that everybody is out there modeling these things, trading \\nagainst these things. So, steady consistent buyers in the marketplace who are so predictable are making a mistake. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nOperator : Does that conclude your question, Erika? \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nVery good. We can go to the next question. Thanks. Yeah. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nOperator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt O\\'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nMatt O\\'Connor \\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.  Q  \\nGood morning. It seems like you guys have backed off the view that you\\'re materially over-earning on net interest income. And is this all \\nbecause of the higher rate environment that\\'s expected now? Or is it also partly a different view on deposit pricing, specifically on the \\nconsumer side, which I think you had assumed it would reprice a bit more than we\\'ve seen? \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nYeah, it\\'s a good question, Matt. I guess maybe let me try to frame this from a couple different perspectives. So, on the one hand, you\\'re right. If \\nyou look at the NII guidance that we\\'re giving you, including the notion that subject to the yield curve panning out in line with the current \\nforwards, which, as we know, is the one thing that we know won\\'t happen. But if you want to assume something, if you assume the forwards, \\nwe\\'re sort of telling you that we might return to sequential growth in the back half of the year, again, based on all of our current assumptions, all \\nelse being equal. And you could draw the conclusion that that means that the overearning narrative is no longer applicable. \\n \\nI think if you take a big step back, by historical standards, the difference between the policy rate and the weighted average rate paid on \\nconsumer deposits remains quite elevated for a variety of reasons and subject to the fact that in the end, deposit pricing is always going to be a \\nresponse to the competitive environment that we experience in the field, the current structure of the yield curve is such that, for the time being \\nanyway, when we do the math, that\\'s what we see. Do we think that\\'s truly, truly, truly sustainable through the cycle? Unclear. But I guess we\\'ll \\ncross that bridge when we come to it. For now, this is the outlook for the coming year. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nAnd we\\'ve gotten closer to normalized NII and normalized credit. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\n \\n \\n  10 \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nYeah. It is worth noting that NII ex. Markets is down year-on-year. So there\\'s some normalization there. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nMatt O\\'Connor \\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.  Q \\nOkay. And then just separately, a strategic question. There\\'s been some reports about you further expanding the Consumer Banking business \\nglobally. And I guess I just want to push on that where we really haven\\'t seen other banks do it in a successful way. Obviously, your approach is \\nkind of coming from a position of strength, leading digitally. But I guess I\\'m just wondering like is it worth it? Is there enough upside to justify \\nmaybe some of the increased regulatory and execution risk of doing global consumer banking? \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nYeah. I think you kind of answered your own questions in a sense, like we talked about this a lot when we first launched the initiative. And I just \\nthink that the comparison to other players is not apt in the current moment. That\\'s not to say that like we\\'re special or anything. It\\'s just that the \\nstrategy is very different and it\\'s a very different moment. So it\\'s a new initiative. It\\'s obviously not risk-free, but it\\'s going pretty well. And  \\npointing out the obvious, if we didn\\'t think it was worth it, we wouldn\\'t be doing it. But we have obviously considered all of the risks and \\nopportunities associated with the decision. And it\\'s one of our strategic initiatives, and those get scrutinized quite aggressively through all of \\nour management processes. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nMatt O\\'Connor \\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.  Q \\nOkay. Thank you. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nOperator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nBetsy L. Graseck \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nHi. Good morning. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nHey, Betsy. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nHey, Betsy. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\n \\n \\n \\n  11 \\nBetsy L. Graseck \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nGuys, can you hear me okay? All right. Just want to make sure you can hear me. So this has been a great call. First, congratulations on a great \\nquarter. It\\'s been a great call with a lot of robust questions here. You\\'re like, what else is there to ask? Here\\'s my question. As we think about the \\nNII outlook and you highlighted the NIM pressure, but loan – but basically, balance is increasing here, right? Maybe you could just speak to – \\ncould you help me understand the order of the drivers? Is it QT going away, deposits going up, punch it into securities? Is it loan growth \\ninflecting? Is there any place in the franchise where you see loan growth opportunities for inflection this coming year? And then lastly, as I think \\nabout your comments around you\\'ve got the green market share number one, you\\'ve got the yellow, you\\'ve got the red, places maybe we can\\'t \\nsee. Could you help us understand where those yellows and reds are – where they are? Are they just scattered, everybody – every single \\nbusiness has one? Or are there some that have more than others and, therefore, more opportunities? And is it more balance sheet or fee-\\ngenerative? That\\'s kind of what I\\'d like to just discuss if you have a minute. Thanks. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nSure. Yeah, let me take a crack at that, Betsy. So, loan growth, I think looking for areas where it might inflect, the only thing I can think of, \\nfrankly, that would be in that category, certainly in terms of being meaningful to the company\\'s performance, would be acquisition finance \\nbecause that\\'s been relatively muted as a a function of the M&A environment, and if that picks up you could see more there. Now, those aren\\'t \\nloans that we necessarily keep on the balance sheet for that long, so whether that shows up in fees or NII or whatever, it\\'s a separate issue. But  \\nas you can see like on our presentation page for the NII outlook, you know that Card loan growth and revolve normalization has been a  \\nsignificant tailwind. And while that is also a driver of growth in 2025, again, based on our current guess about the future, it will be – it\\'s \\ndecelerating a little bit, rather than the opposite. \\n \\nStill growing above trend obviously, which is great, and it\\'s a sign of the strength of the franchise and the amount of engagement that we\\'re \\ngetting from our Card clients, but the big normalization tailwinds there are gone. You know well the state of the mortgage market given rates. \\nRates are also a headwind in some other pockets like our multifamily lending business at the margin. So, yeah, I think a higher growth \\nenvironment, a little bit more optimism, could you see a bit more loan growth in Business Banking? Could you see a bit more growth in C&I at \\nthe margin? Yes. But I think the place where you might see inflection is more in the areas that are deal-driven, I would say. So, we\\'ll see. We\\'ll \\nsee what happens there. And in terms of the reds and the ambers under the green, I think you know them, right? And they\\'re aligned with our \\nbig long-standing investment strategies. \\n \\nThe biggest single one arguably is that in what you might call the affluent section of the Wealth Management space, we are significantly \\nunderpenetrated relative to the number of households that we bank in the country and our capabilities and our brand and what we think we \\nbring to the table. So, that\\'s why we\\'re pushing so hard on that front, because I think we can get more share there and it completes the \\nfranchise very nicely. There are a bunch of examples elsewhere, but we talk a lot about drilling down inside the Markets business, inside \\nInvestment Banking and finding the places where even where at the aggregate global sector level we look great and any given region and any \\ngiven subsector we can do better. And as I mentioned, we continue to look at that as aggressively as ever. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nBetsy L. Graseck \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nThank you. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nThank you, Betsy. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nOperator : Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\n \\n \\n  12 \\nEbrahim H. Poonawala \\nAnalyst, BofA Securities, Inc.  Q \\nGood morning. I guess just two questions. In terms of areas of vulnerability, so I heard you, Jeremy, on the lending side, but lots of \\ncrosscurrents. Like, if we anchor to the fact that you have a new administration that\\'s taking place or take office with a focus on domestic \\nCapEx. Even if we don\\'t get any rates cut, when you look through your customer base where do you see areas of vulnerability, be it because of \\ntariffs, be it because of just lack of any additional relief from the Fed? Yeah, would love to hear just from a credit quality perspective what no \\nrate cuts might mean. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nOh, I see where your question is. That took me a second. Yeah, I mean, look, wholesale credit is pretty hard to predict. It tends to be very \\nidiosyncratic. You obviously know that we\\'re coming out of a 10-plus year period of an exceptionally low charge-off rate, and so at some point \\nthat has to normalize to a slightly more reasonable level, a little bit to Jamie\\'s comments earlier about how some things are still not fully \\nnormalized, and arguably wholesale credit could be one of those. We do run extensive stress tests on the sensitivities to the portfolio – of the  \\nportfolio to rate shock. A lot of what we do from an underwriting perspective is designed to protect us from that, frankly. So, you can rest \\nassured that we\\'re running the relevant analysis, but I\\'m not inclined to go into detail on any given sector or whatever. Jamie, did you want to \\nadd? \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nI would just point the biggest driver of credit has been and always will be unemployment. That\\'s both in the consumer side and it bleeds into \\nthe corporate side. It bleeds into mortgages, sub-prime, credit card. So, really, it\\'s your forecast of unemployment, which you have to make \\nyour own, which will determine that over time. And so, the second thing you said, vulnerabilities, it\\'s unemployment, but the worst case would  \\nbe stagflation. Higher rates with higher unemployment will drive higher credit losses literally across the board. We\\'re not predicting that, but \\nyou just asked where the vulnerability is, that\\'s the vulnerability. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nEbrahim H. Poonawala \\nAnalyst, BofA Securities, Inc.  Q \\nAnd I guess – thanks for that. Just sticking with that, as far as QT is concerned, when you talk to experts, like no one knows where the right level \\nfor the Fed to end is. I\\'m just wondering if you have any thoughts there on when Fed should end the pressure on the system, and what it may \\nimply for deposit growth? \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nYeah. I think the conventional wisdom on QT, and I\\'m not pretending to add to the conventional wisdom one way or the other, is that the \\ntapering should sort of complete and, therefore, we might see an end sometime in the middle of the year. Of course, they may change that, but \\nthat seems to be the current market consensus. And when we sort of take a step back and look at the H.8 data and our kind of flow of funds \\nmodels and that type of stuff, when you look at the way our peers are behaving, evolution of QT, expectations for economy-wide loan growth, et \\ncetera, and what the impact of that might be on the growth of system-wide deposits, it\\'s kind of consistent with the story that we\\'re telling \\nabout sort of the background growth in our NII outlook, plus or minus, what happens with the policy rate and stabilizing and growing deposit \\nbalances through the second half of the year. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\n \\n \\n \\n  13 \\nEbrahim H. Poonawala \\nAnalyst, BofA Securities, Inc.  Q \\nThank you. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nOperator : Thank you. Our final question comes from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nGerard Cassidy \\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC  Q \\nHi, Jeremy. Hi, Jamie. Jeremy... \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nGood morning, Gerard. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nGerard Cassidy \\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC  Q \\n...you mentioned in your comments about the overall Firmwide deposits have stabilized in the second half. You could see some growth and \\nyou\\'re very – I think you said you started to see maybe some of that in the consumer checking deposits. We noticed in the industry data from \\nthe regulators, household checking deposits pre-pandemic for the industry were running about $1 trillion. Now, they have remained elevated \\npost-pandemic at $4 trillion. Can you – based on what you\\'re seeing in your customer base, what can you attribute the strength to in this \\nconsumer checking account deposits? \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nThat\\'s fascinating, Gerard. I’ll have to take a look at that data. I don\\'t actually recognize those numbers. But I can speak for ourselves, which is \\nthat when we look at the encouraging growth that we see in our checking franchise, it\\'s a couple of things. So, of course, there was some \\nexcess, and there was some yield-seeking behavior. So you did see people moving money out of checking into higher-yielding alternatives \\nover the course of the last couple of years in the rate cycle. It feels to us as if we\\'re in the final innings of that. We\\'re just not seeing nearly as \\nmuch yield-seeking pressure as we had seen. In the meantime, as you well know, we are aggressively engaging with clients and acquiring all \\nthe new clients and deepening in a lot of different markets as part of our branch expansion strategy and the deepening in all of those markets. \\n \\nSo the combination of the tail-end of the yield-seeking flows and excellent client engagement and success in the sort of organic build out of \\nthat franchise is starting to show up in checking account growth, which we see as a very healthy indicator for the franchise. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nGerard Cassidy \\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC  Q \\nVery good. And then as a follow-up, circling back about the capital levels, you guys have been very clear about where you want them to be. Can \\nyou share the pros and cons from JPMorgan\\'s perspective? Not so much from an investor, but we understand, of course, you can do a share \\nrepurchase. Obviously, you can do non-depository acquisitions with the excess capital. But what are the pros and cons of a special dividend to \\nreduce that excess capital if you continue with these incredible profitability levels of 20% return on tangible common equity? You\\'re growing \\nyour income and capital very nicely every year. But what are those pros and cons, again, from JPMorgan\\'s perspective? \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\n \\n \\n  14 \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nYeah. So, we made some public comments on this at a conference some time back. So he\\'ll – he wants to go. So, go ahead. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nNo. No. Jeremy, go ahead. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nNo, no, no. You go. Seriously. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nI was just going to say we\\'re not going to do one. We have looked at it. If you all have any great insights for us, let us know, but most people \\ndon\\'t want it, doesn\\'t add shareholder value. And I\\'ve never thought of having cash in your pocket as a bad thing. I think it\\'s a huge mistake to \\nlook at life and you have to \"deploy capital\". So we want to be very, very patient. But special dividends, if you look at the history of special \\ndividends, they really basically don\\'t work. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nIf anyone has a different opinion, we\\'re always interested. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nGerard Cassidy \\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC  Q \\nSounds good.

Welcome to JPMorganChase\\'s First-Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. \\nYour line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. The presentation is available on JPMorganChase\\'s \\nwebsite. Please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward-looking statements. Please stand by.  \\n \\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorganChase\\'s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and the Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy \\nBarnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase \\nThank you and good morning, everyone. Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $14.6 billion, EPS of $5.07 on revenue of $46 \\nbillion, with an ROTCE of 21%. These results included a First Republic-related gain of $588 million, which was previously disclosed in the 10-K. \\n \\nOn page 2, we have more on our first-quarter results. The Firm reported revenue of $46 billion, up $3.5 billion, or 8% year-on-year. NII ex. \\nMarkets was down $430 million, or 2%, driven by the impact of lower rates and deposit margin compression, as well as lower deposit balances \\nin CCB. This was predominantly offset by higher Card revolving balances, the impact of securities activity, including from prior quarters, as well \\nas higher wholesale deposits. NIR ex. Markets was up $2.2 billion, or 20%, and excluding the significant item I just mentioned, was up 14%, \\nlargely on higher asset management fees, lower net investment securities losses and higher investment banking fees. And Markets revenue \\nwas up $1.7 billion, or 21%. \\n \\nExpenses of $23.6 billion were up $840 million, or 4%, largely driven by compensation, including growth in employees across the front office \\nand technology, higher brokerage and distribution fees, as well as marketing and legal expense. \\n \\nThe quarter also reflected a $323 million release of the FDIC special assessment accrual compared with a $725 million increase in the prior \\nquarter. Credit costs were $3.3 billion, with net charge-offs of $2.3 billion and a net reserve build of $973 million. We have more details on the \\nreserve build on page 3. With this quarter\\'s reserve build, the Firm’s total allowance for credit losses is $27.6 billion. \\n \\nLet\\'s take a second to add a little bit of context to our thinking surrounding this number in light of the unique environment of the last several \\nweeks. Our first quarter allowance is anchored on the relatively benign central case economic outlook, which was in effect at the end of the \\nquarter. But, in light of the significantly elevated risks and uncertainties at the time, we increased the probability weightings associated with \\nthe downside scenarios in our CECL framework. As a result, the weighted-average unemployment rate embedded in our allowance is 5.8%, up \\nfrom 5.5% last quarter, driving the $973 million increase in the allowance. \\n \\nSo with that in mind, the consumer build of $441 million was driven by changes in the weighted-average macroeconomic outlook. The \\nwholesale build of $549 million was predominantly driven by credit quality changes on certain exposures and net lending activity, as well as \\nchanges in the outlook. In addition, it\\'s important to note that the increase in the allowance is not, to any meaningful degree, driven by \\ndeterioration in the actual credit performance in the portfolio, which remains largely in line with expectations. \\n \\nWith that, let\\'s go to the balance sheet and capital on page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15.4%, down 30 basis points versus the \\nprior quarter as net income and OCI gains were more than offset by capital distributions and higher RWA. This quarter, the Firm distributed $11 \\nbillion of capital to shareholders, which reflects $7.1 billion of net common share repurchases and the payment of our common dividend, which \\nhas been increased to $1.40 per share. This quarter\\'s higher RWA is primarily driven by overall business growth in Markets and some seasonal \\neffects. \\n \\nNow let\\'s go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 5. Consumers and small businesses remain financially healthy. Despite the recent \\ndowntrends in consumer and small business sentiment, based on our data, spend, cash buffers, payment to income ratios, and credit \\nutilization are all in line with our expectations. \\n \\nMoving to the financial results, CCB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $18.3 billion, which was up 4% year-on-year. In Banking & \\nWealth Management, revenue was down 1% year-on-year, driven by lower deposit NII, predominantly offset by growth in Wealth Management \\nrevenue. Average deposits were down 2% year-on-year and flat sequentially, while end of period deposits were up 2% quarter-on-quarter. \\n \\n \\n  2 \\nClient investment assets were up 7% year-on-year, predominantly driven by market performance, and we continue to see strong flows into \\nmanaged products. \\n \\nIn Home Lending, revenue was up 2% year-on-year and originations were up 42% year-on-year, off a small base in a slowly growing market. \\n \\nTurning to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by Card NII on higher revolving balances as well as \\nhigher operating lease income in Auto. Card outstandings were up 10%, due to strong account acquisition. And in Auto, originations were $10.7 \\nbillion, up 20%, driven by higher lease volume. \\n \\nExpenses of $9.9 billion were up 6% year-on-year, predominantly driven by growth in marketing and technology, higher field compensation, as \\nwell as higher auto lease depreciation. Credit costs were $2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.2 billion, up $275 million year-on-year, \\npredominantly driven by the seasoning of recent vintages in Card with delinquencies and losses in line with expectations. The net reserve build \\nwas $475 million, of which $400 million was in Card. \\n \\nNext, the Commercial & Investment Bank on page 6. CIB reported net income of $6.9 billion on revenue of $19.7 billion, which was up 12% year-\\non-year. IB fees were up 12% year-on-year, and we ranked number one with wallet share of 9%. In Advisory, fees were up 16%, benefiting from \\nthe closing of deals announced in 2024. Net underwriting fees were up 16%, primarily driven by elevated refinancing activity, particularly in \\nLeveraged Finance. In Equity underwriting, fees were down 9% year-on-year, reflecting challenging market conditions. \\n \\nIn light of market conditions, we are adopting a cautious stance on the Investment Banking outlook. While client engagement and dialog is \\nquite elevated, both the conversion of the existing pipeline and origination of new activity will require a reduction in the current levels of \\nuncertainty. \\n \\nPayments revenue was up 3% year-on-year excluding equity investments, driven by higher deposit balances and fee growth, predominantly \\noffset by deposit margin compression. Lending revenue was up 11% year-on-year, driven by lower losses on hedges, partially offset by lower \\nbalances. \\n \\nMoving to Markets, total revenue was up 21% year-on-year, reflecting record performance in Equities. Fixed Income was up 8% with better \\nperformance in Rates and Commodities against a relatively weak prior-year quarter. Equities was up 48% as the business performed well \\nduring a period of elevated volatility, supported by higher client activity and strong monetization of flows, particularly in Derivatives. \\n \\nSecurities Services revenue was up 7% year-on-year, driven by fee growth and higher deposit balances, partially offset by deposit margin \\ncompression. \\n \\nExpenses of $9.8 billion were up 13% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, legal and brokerage expense. Average \\nBanking & Payments loans were down 3% year-on-year and down 1% sequentially as we continued to observe payoff activity and limited \\ndemand for new loans across client segments. Average client deposits were up 11% year-on-year and up 2% sequentially, reflecting increased \\nactivity across Payments and Securities Services. Finally, credit costs were $705 million, largely driven by the net reserve build. \\n \\nThen to complete our lines of business, Asset & Wealth Management on page 7. AWM reported net income of $1.6 billion with pre-tax margin \\nof 35%. Revenue of $5.7 billion was up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by growth in management fees on strong net inflows and higher \\naverage market levels, as well as higher brokerage activity and higher deposit balances. \\n \\nExpenses of $3.7 billion were up 7% year-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation and \\ncontinued growth in our private banking advisor teams, as well as higher distribution fees. Long-term net inflows were $54 billion for the \\nquarter, primarily driven by Equity and Fixed Income. In liquidity, we saw net inflows of $36 billion. \\n \\nAUM of $4.1 trillion and client assets of $6 trillion were both up 15% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels. And \\nfinally, loans were up 5% year-on-year and flat quarter-on-quarter, and deposits were up 7% year-on-year and down 2% sequentially. \\n \\nTurning to Corporate on page 8. Corporate reported net income of $1.7 billion. Revenue of $2.3 billion was up $102 million year-on-year. NII of \\n$1.7 billion was down $826 million year-on-year. NIR was a net gain of $653 million compared with a net loss of $275 million in the prior year. \\nThe current quarter included the significant item I mentioned upfront, while the prior-year quarter included net securities losses of $336 (sic) \\n[$366] million. \\n \\n \\n \\n  3 \\nExpenses of $185 million were down $1.1 billion year-on-year, driven by the changes to the FDIC special assessment accruals I mentioned \\nupfront. \\n \\nTo finish up, let\\'s turn to the full year outlook on page 9. We continue to expect NII ex. Markets to be approximately $90 billion. The Firmwide \\nNII outlook has increased to about $94.5 billion, reflecting an increase in Markets NII, which you should think of as being primarily offset in NIR. \\nOur adjusted expense outlook continues to be about $95 billion. And on credit, we expect the Card net charge-off rate to be in line with our \\nprevious guidance of approximately 3.6%. \\n \\nSo to wrap up, we\\'re pleased with another quarter of strong operating performance – but of course, the focus right now is on the future, which \\nis obviously unusually uncertain. But no matter what outcomes eventually materialize, we are eager to do our part to continue to support our \\nclients, the markets and the broader economy, and we believe the banking system will be a source of strength in this dynamic environment. \\n \\nAnd with that, let\\'s open the line for Q&A.  \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nQUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION \\n \\nOperator : Thank you. Please stand by. Our first question comes from Ken Usdin with Autonomous. You may proceed. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nKen Usdin \\nAnalyst, Autonomous Research Q \\nGood morning, Jeremy. Wondering if you could start by just kind of amplifying just the macro commentary that you started off on. And given \\nthe uncertainty in the world that you referenced, just how are you seeing the activity change across the customer base from consumers to \\nwholesale? And can you just talk through how that\\'s also just informing any changes in your – some of your growth and reserving \\nexpectations? Thanks. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nSure, Ken. So I mean, at a high level, I would say that obviously, some of the salient news flow is quite recent. So, we\\'ve done some soundings \\nand some checking both on the consumer side and on the wholesale side. I think on the consumer side, the thing to check is the spending data. \\nAnd to be honest, the main thing that we see there, what would appear to be a certain amount of frontloading of spending ahead of people \\nexpecting price increases from tariffs. So ironically, that\\'s actually somewhat supportive, all else equal. But I think what it sort of highlights is \\nthat during this transitional period and this elevated uncertainty, you might see some distortions in the data that make it hard to draw larger \\nconclusions. \\n \\nIn terms of our corporate clients, obviously, they\\'ve been reacting to the changes in tariff policy. And at the margin, that shifts their focus away \\nfrom more strategic priorities with obvious implications for the Investment Banking pipeline outlook towards more short-term work, optimizing \\nsupply chains and trying to figure out how they\\'re going to respond to the current environment. So as a result, I think we would characterize \\nwhat we\\'re hearing from our corporate clients as a little bit of a wait-and-see attitude. \\n \\nI do think you see obvious differences across sectors. Some sectors are going to be much more exposed than others and have more \\ncomplicated problems to solve. And also across the size of the clients, I think smaller clients, small business and smaller corporates are \\nprobably a little bit more challenged. I think the larger corporates have a bit more experience dealing with these things and more resources to \\nmanage. So that\\'s a little bit our read of the situation right now. But certainly, a bit of a wait-and-see attitude. It\\'s hard to make long-term \\ndecisions right now, and so we\\'ll see how that plays out. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nKen Usdin \\nAnalyst, Autonomous Research  Q \\nYeah. And just one question on the NII ex. Markets holding at $90 billion. Can you just walk us through the puts and takes of just what\\'s the new \\ncurve you\\'re using, which also is subject to change every day and what might have been some of the positive offsets to if you put in more \\nexpected cuts than you had before? Thanks. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\n \\n \\n  4 \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nYeah, that\\'s a good question, Ken. You\\'re right. So if you remember, last quarter we said that we had one cut in the curve. I think latest curve has \\nsomething like three cuts. And so, we\\'ve talked a lot, obviously, about how we are asset sensitive. You now see our EaR disclosed in the \\nsupplement, and probably our empirical EaR is a little bit higher than our modeled EaR as a result of the relatively low – lower than modeled \\nrates paid in Consumer. So when you put that together, all else equal, the drop in the weighted-average IORB, which is about 22 basis points, \\nshould produce a notable headwind in our NII ex. Markets. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase  A \\nIn the curve basically. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nYeah. This is basically – that\\'s just mechanically... \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase  A \\nThis is guaranteed not to happen. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nSo that\\'s mechanically just flowing through the curve. So yeah, your question is that given that, why are you not revising down? And the answer \\nto that is that across all the puts and takes actually, our number is a tiny bit lower. It\\'s just not enough to warrant a change in the outlook. But we \\ndo have some offsets. So we have some balance effects that are favorable. You will have noted that I talked about higher wholesale deposit \\nbalances, for example. We see beta outperforming in a couple of different places in CDs and in wholesale. \\n \\nThe other thing is that you\\'ll recall, we talked before about having a placeholder in our NII outlook for the potential impact of the Card late fee \\nrule. We\\'ve now removed that. So that\\'s a little bit of an offset as well. So that\\'s kind of how you get to unchanged, even though clearly, all else \\nequal, the lower expected front-end rates are a headwind. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nOperator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. You may proceed. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nErika Najarian \\nAnalyst, UBS Securities LLC  Q \\nYes. Good morning. This question is for Jamie. Jamie, you were on the media today talking about potential economic turbulence. But Jeremy \\nalso mentioned that banking should be – the banking system should be a source of strength in this turbulence. The equity market always \\nseems to think about the banks as weaker players given how they trade the stocks more on sentiment and fear rather than the math of – the \\nability of banks to absorb provisions going forward, if we do fall into a slower economic downturn. \\n \\nSo, I guess, just the question here is, can you double-click on how you think this is going to impact the economy going forward and maybe \\ndouble-click on Jeremy\\'s statement that the banking system should be a source of strength? \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  5 \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nI just – before Jamie answers that, Erika, I just want to make one brief comment, which is the banking system being a source of strength means \\nwhat it says. In other words, banks doing their job to support the economy. That\\'s not a statement about bank equity performance and the \\nextent to which banks are cyclical or not. Like obviously, a recessionary environment, as I\\'ve frequently said, all else equal, is bad for banks  \\nfrom an equity performance perspective. We\\'re talking about the financial strength of banks\\' balance sheets and our ability to support our \\nclients in a difficult moment. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nEveryone trades stocks in a different way, so sentiment – but banks are a cork in the ocean when it comes to the economy. If the economy gets \\nworse, credit losses will go up, volumes can change, deal curves can change. And we\\'re not predicting all of that. What I would say is our \\nexcellent economist, Michael Feroli, I called him this morning, specifically to ask him, how they\\'re looking at their forecast today, they think it\\'s \\nabout 50-50 for a recession. So I\\'ll just refer to that. Obviously, if there\\'s a recession, credit losses will go up and other factors will change, too. \\n \\nAnd I think the one thing I\\'ll add to what Jeremy said is – and I don\\'t usually pay that much attention to anecdotes, but this time I am. And I think \\nyou\\'re going to see a lot of companies – you guys – not you, but the analyst community has already reduced its earnings estimates for the S&P \\nby 5%. So it\\'s – now it\\'s up 5% as opposed to up 10%. My guess is that will be zero and negative 5%, probably in the next month. \\n \\nAnd then you\\'re going to hear 1,000 companies report, and they\\'re going to tell you what their guidance is. My guess is a lot will remove it. \\nThey\\'re going to tell you what they think it might do to their customers, their base, their earnings, their cost, their tariffs. It\\'s different for every \\ncompany. But I assume you\\'ll see that. And anecdotally, a lot of people are not doing things because of this. They\\'re going to wait and see. And \\nthat\\'s M&A, that\\'s M&A with middle market companies, that\\'s people\\'s hiring plans and stuff like that. So people have to adjust to this new \\nenvironment. And I think we\\'ll see what it is. \\n \\nI just also want to point out, just to – so you can round it up. This is to make you feel comfortable, not uncomfortable. When COVID hit, \\nunemployment went from like 4% to 15% in a couple of months, and we had to add to reserves in a two-month period of $15 billion. And then to \\nshow you how stupid CECL is, in the three month – three quarter period, we took down the $15 billion. So, just – that just sizes up a bad \\nrecession. If it\\'s a mild recession, it will be less than that. If it\\'s a really bad recession, it will be more than that. Either way, we can handle it and \\nserve our clients. Earnings won\\'t be great and the stocks will go down, which I look at as an opportunity to buy back more stock. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nErika Najarian \\nAnalyst, UBS Securities LLC  Q \\nGot it. And a second follow-up question. And I don\\'t disagree with you guys on equity market performance of bank stocks. It\\'s just that the \\nmindset of portfolio managers is they always go back to sort of the lowest common denominator of fundamental performance versus thinking \\nabout resilience. \\n \\nAnd to that point, the second question is on the reserve. Jeremy, you mentioned a weighted-average unemployment rate of 5.8%. I think that\\'s \\nabove where economists are thinking we could peak even in a recession scenario. How should we think about any incremental builds from \\nhere? And what you are going – obviously, deterioration in the outlook, but what more do you need to see in terms of how you make decisions \\nabout further builds from here? \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nYeah, Erika, it\\'s a good question. But the truth is there\\'s just a little bit too much uncertainty right now for me to sort of give an outlook for \\nreserves, which is generally not a thing that we do anyway. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the [indiscernible] forecast at the end of \\nthe quarter was the sort of bog standard, no landing, barely any increase in unemployment. Given that we knew at the time that there was – \\nthere were some big pending announcements, and there was quite a bit of elevated uncertainty around that, it felt like the forecasts were kind \\nof lagging because people were just waiting to actually get the information and so it felt appropriate to add a little bit of downside skew to our \\nprobability assessment, which is what led to the increase and what led to the build. \\n \\n \\n \\n  6 \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nWe use this weighted-average unemployment thing as a useful way to help explain what\\'s going on inside the reserve. But obviously, the actual \\nmechanisms are quite complex, the depth in any financial recession, the timing of it, distribution of outcomes, which sectors have hits, \\nidiosyncratic stuff in wholesale. There\\'s a lot. \\n \\nI think on consumer, as Jamie mentioned, it is worth remembering that by far the most important variable is unemployment. So if the labor \\nmarket remains very strong, consumer credit will probably be fine. If it doesn\\'t, then you\\'re going to see it play through the way it always does. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nErika Najarian \\nAnalyst, UBS Securities LLC  Q \\nThank you. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nOperator : Thank you. Our next question… \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nThanks, Erika. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nOperator : I apologize. Our next question comes from John McDonald with Truist Securities. You may proceed. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJohn McDonald \\nAnalyst, Truist Securities Inc.  Q \\nHi, good morning. Jeremy, on that same topic, no change to the full year credit Card net charge-off forecast. How do we square that with the \\nrising recession risk? Is it because you already have a couple of months of delinquencies kind of baked in the cake and this is more an issue for \\nnext year, or just too early to call? \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nWe should have not given you that forecast. We don\\'t know what the number is going to be. That\\'s a... \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJohn McDonald \\nAnalyst, Truist Securities Inc.  Q \\nYeah.  \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nI would say that\\'s a short-term number, and based on what\\'s happening today, there\\'s a wide range of potential outcomes. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJohn McDonald \\nAnalyst, Truist Securities Inc.  Q \\nYeah. Okay. Okay, yeah, that\\'s what we were kind of thinking. And then... \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\n \\n \\n \\n  7 \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nBut, mechanically, John, though, as you alluded to, there are some mechanical elements to the way Card charge-off works that means that it\\'s \\npretty baked pretty far ahead of time. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nThe next couple of quarters. Yeah. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nSo, sort of echoing Jamie\\'s point, it just doesn\\'t necessarily tell you that much about what might actually happen through the end of the year. \\nEven if unemployment were to increase significantly, it probably wouldn\\'t flow through the charge-offs until later. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJohn McDonald \\nAnalyst, Truist Securities Inc.  Q  \\nOkay. Got it. And then just on capital, how does this type of macro uncertainty impact your thinking around conserving capital as opposed to \\ndeploying it through your investment agenda and buybacks as the stock gets cheaper? Or just, are you still looking to arrest the increase or \\ndoes this kind of change it? \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nThe investment that we do in banks, branches, technology, AI is going to continue regardless of the environment. And then we have – \\ndepending what happens to Basel III and CCAR and G-SIFI and all that, $30 billion to $60 billion of excess capital. And in the Chairman\\'s letter, I \\nwrote about what we think of that. But based upon the environment, the turbulence issues, I like having excess capital. We are prepared for any \\nenvironment. And that\\'s so we can serve clients. That\\'s not for any other reason. So, we have plenty of capital and plenty of liquidity to get \\nthrough whatever the stormy seas are. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJohn McDonald \\nAnalyst, Truist Securities Inc.  Q \\nOkay. Thank you. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nThanks John. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nOperator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt O\\'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nMatt O’Connor  \\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.  Q \\nGood morning. Just wanted to drill down on the credit card spend. Any comments in terms of changing patterns on the consumer card spend? \\nThere\\'s been headlines in travel kind of going down. Just talk about some of the puts and takes in that up 7% year-over-year. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  8 \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nYeah, it\\'s a good question and we\\'re seeing that too. So let me talk about travel. I mean we obviously saw the airlines discuss what they are \\nseeing as headwinds for them, specifically in airline travel, and we\\'re seeing that too through the card spend. It\\'s not obvious to us that that\\'s \\nnecessarily an indicator for broader patterns. There are a variety of potential explanations for the narrow drop in airline spend. \\n \\nAnd as I mentioned previously, another thing that we are seeing looking at the April data is what would appear to be a little bit of front-loading \\nof spending, specifically in items that might be – have prices go up as a function of tariffs. So you see people behaving rationally, and I have \\nnoted even you hear anecdotes, and I\\'ve seen evidence of companies specifically advertising we have pre-tariff inventory and so on and so \\nforth. So it\\'s not that surprising that you\\'re seeing that a little bit in the spending data. \\n \\nThe other thing that people are kind of interested in this space is like what\\'s happening by income band, because we have seen some of the \\nretailers and other folks talking about weaknesses in the lower income segment. And I think when we look at our Card data and also our cash \\nbuffers and peoples\\' checking accounts, of course, it is true that it is relatively weaker in the lower income segment. But when you take a step \\nback and you ask, are we seeing signs of distress in the lower income segment? The answer is no. So, sure, the margin and cash buffers are \\nlower, and you see some rotation of spend and spending is a little bit weaker than it was in the peak spending moments. But actually, some of \\nthe increases in spending that we\\'re seeing in April are actually coming from the lower income segment. So no evidence of distress, I would \\nsay. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nMatt O’Connor  \\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.  Q \\nOkay. That\\'s helpful color. And then just separately, if we look at the delinquencies for the Home Lending, the increase both quarter-on-quarter \\nand year-over-year, is that just some of the noise from the First Republic deal as you take the marks upfront and then those portfolios \\nessentially re-season from an accounting point of view? Or is there something else going on there? \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nSorry, the – I actually didn\\'t hear. Which fees? \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nDelinquencies in Home Lending. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nI didn\\'t – interesting. I haven\\'t looked at that. We\\'ll have to get back to you on that \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nI don\\'t think it\\'s anything... \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nWhatever it is, it wasn\\'t important enough to get raised, so. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\n \\n \\n \\n  9 \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nIt could be the First Republic accounting, yes \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nYeah. Anything is possible. We\\'ll get back to you on that. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nMatt O’Connor  \\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.  Q \\nOkay. Thank you. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nOperator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. You may proceed. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nSteven Chubak \\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research LLC  Q \\nHi. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to start off with one on the proposed SLR changes and just the impact of rate \\nvolatility. The Treasury is committed to providing relief to the banks under the SLR just to help mitigate some of the volatility in the 10-year. But \\ngiven the geopolitical concerns, weakening global demand for treasuries, how does it inform your appetite just for purchasing U.S. Treasuries \\nif those reforms are implemented and just how you\\'re managing rate risk maybe more holistically across the Firm, just in light of some the \\nrecent volatility? \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nYes. So SLR alone isn\\'t going to change that much for us. It may change for other people. We really need reform across SLR, G-SIFI, CCAR, \\nBasel III and LCR, all of which have deep flaws in them to make a material change. And remember, it\\'s not relief to the banks; it\\'s relief to the \\nmarkets. JPMorgan will be fine with/without an SLR change. The reason to change some of these things is so banks – the big market makers \\ncould intermediate more in the markets. If they don\\'t – if they do, spreads will come in, there\\'ll be more active traders. If they don\\'t, the Fed will \\nhave to intermediate, which I think is just a bad policy idea that every time there\\'s a kerfuffle in the markets, the Fed has to come in and \\nintermediate. So they should make these changes. \\n \\nThe point – the reason why is when you have very – a lot of volatile markets and very wide spreads and low liquidity in treasuries, it affects all \\nother capital markets. That\\'s the reason to do it; not as a favor to the banks themselves. And we don\\'t take more interest rate exposure to this \\nin any way, shape or form. So it\\'s not like we\\'re going to change our position. We intermediate in the markets to help clients do what they have \\nto do. And if the banks could take bigger positions, they would have just larger dealer positions and take no – basically take not much more \\ninterest rate exposure. I should say that our folks did a fabulous job trading this quarter. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nAnd Steve, all I would add to that is that it is, of course, true, and we all remember the moment a few years ago when intermediaries were, in \\nfact, bound by SLR as a result of the expansion of the deposit base, and extraordinary actions needed to be taken to address that. So we\\'ve \\nseen when it is binding, and it works not as designed, which is why we do very much agree that it should be fixed. I think our point is a little bit, \\nas Jamie said in his Chairman\\'s letter, that it\\'s not the only thing that needs to be fixed, and there are interactions among all these things. And \\nwe, as a bank, are not particularly bound by it. \\n \\nThere is some interesting nuance too in terms of the potential TLAC issuance impact there, which is quite sensitive to which particular fix gets \\nput in. So that will be an interesting thing to watch. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\n \\n \\n  10 \\nSteven Chubak \\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research LLC  Q \\nThank you both for that perspective. And just for my follow-up, did want to ask on the Markets outlook. So, admittedly, less surprising to hear \\nsome of the cautious IB commentary in light of the uncertainty. But was hoping you could just speak to the Markets businesses which have \\nbeen performing extraordinarily well of late and just given the combination of elevated volatility, but also some indications that clients are \\ntaking down risk, how you expect that business to perform over the coming quarters. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nYeah. It\\'s a good question. As you know, Steve, we\\'re obviously not going to give Markets guidance. Your guess is as good as ours at some \\nlevel. But the ingredients are the right ingredients. I mean, we\\'ve often discussed about how this business, all else equal, benefits from a volatile \\nenvironment if markets are operating relatively normally, which they more or less have been. Of course, it\\'s not guaranteed. We need to do a \\ngood job managing the risk. And yeah, there are states of the world where if our clients are struggling or deleveraging or taking down risk, that \\ncould be a headwind for us. So we\\'re going to just do what we always do and try to manage the risk well and serve our clients, but we were \\ncertainly happy to see the performance this quarter. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nSteven Chubak \\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research LLC Q \\nThat\\'s great. Thank you both for taking my questions. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nOperator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nGerard Cassidy \\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC  Q \\nThank you. Hi, Jeremy and Jamie. Can you guys share with us – if you take a look at the non-traditional lenders, private credit lenders, they\\'ve \\nbeen very active in grabbing market share from the traditional commercial banks over the last two or three years, particularly since the initial \\nBasel III Endgame proposal came out in July of 2023, which is no longer applicable. But are you guys seeing any opportunities where \\ncustomers may re-intermediate back into the banks like your bank because of this volatility? \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nI mean that\\'s hard to tell, Gerard. I think it\\'s too early to tell. But what I would say is that it kind of – your question aligns with what we\\'ve been \\nsaying about this space for some time, which is we want to be product agnostic here and give our clients the best option that makes sense for \\nthem in the moment. Whether that\\'s a traditional syndicated lending facility or something that looks more like a unitranche, direct lending type \\nstructure, we\\'re open for business for all of it. \\n \\nAnd I would say that when we talk about the financial system being a source – the banking system being a source of strength in this \\nenvironment, part of what we\\'re talking about is our commitment and willingness to lend through cycles, as we\\'ve always done in the past and \\nthat we have the underwriting capability and the capital and the liquidity and the experience to be reliable lenders in serving our clients no \\nmatter what type of environment we\\'re in. So, if that means that we have an opportunity to compete incrementally even more effectively in this \\nenvironment, that will be great. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nGerard Cassidy \\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC  Q \\nVery good. Thank you. And then as a follow-up, you both just talked about the potential changes to the different regulatory outcomes for you \\nand your peers, whether it\\'s SLR or the G-SIB buffer, et cetera. Can you opine for us your views? Are you more confident with the new \\nadministration, the new personnel, whether it\\'s Treasury Secretary Bessent or others, the nominees for different regulatory heads that there \\nwill be a better chance of real regulatory reform, they see it the way you guys do versus the prior administration? \\n \\n \\n  11 \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nYeah, I mean, Gerard, we always say this, and it\\'s true, which is that we work with all administrations and every administration as constructively \\nas possible to express our opinions and advocate for the things that we think are right for the banking system and for the economy as a whole, \\nand that was true before, and it\\'s true now with this administration as well. \\n \\nClearly, the administration has been quite vocal about wanting more pro-growth policies at the margin and for wanting to make it easier for \\nbanks to participate more constructively in the economy. And as we see the various folks and the various agencies go through the \\nconfirmation process, it will be helpful to have people in seats and get to work on some of the things that we want to get done. So let\\'s see how \\nthat plays out, but we\\'re looking forward to continuing to engage constructively. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nYeah. I think there\\'s a deep recognition of the flaws in the system, and there should be, and fortunately, they\\'re going to take a good look at it. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nGerard Cassidy \\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC  Q \\nVery good. Thank you. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nThanks, Gerard. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nOperator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. You may proceed. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nEbrahim Poonawala \\nAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Q \\nThank you. Good morning. I guess just wanted to follow up on the macro uncertainty. I think when you talk to investors, we\\'ve gone from \\nenthusiasm for a pro-business administration to a lot of headwinds. And I think Jamie mentioned you\\'ll have companies take down guidance, et \\ncetera, potentially over the coming weeks. I\\'m just wondering what is it you think we need to see before this uncertainty abates, or the 90-day \\npause that we saw with some of the other countries on tariffs. Is that enough? Or I\\'m just wondering when you talk to clients, corporate CEOs, \\nwhat are they looking for from the administration that would inject confidence to get back anywhere close to where we were maybe 60 or 90 \\ndays ago? \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nFirst of all, some of all the issues that are raised existed before the new administration, like the geopolitical situation, the excess fiscal deficits, \\npoorly done regulations and all that. Obviously, pro-growth is good, pro-business is good, pro-dereg is good. I think the best thing to do is to \\nallow the Secretary of Treasury and the folks working with him and the administration to finish as quick as possible the agreements that they \\nneed to make with – around tariffs and with our trading partners. And I think there\\'ll be agreements in principle. They\\'re not going to be – trade \\nagreements themselves would be 5,000 or 10,000 pages long. And that\\'s the best way to go about it right now. That does not mean you won\\'t \\nhave some of the effects take place anyway. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  12 \\nEbrahim Poonawala \\nAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Q \\nGot it. I guess as a follow up, I think there\\'s a lot of concern also in the treasury markets. We\\'ve seen the 10-year move from 3.99% to 4.50% in a \\nmatter of a week. Just your comfort level on terms of the functioning of the treasury market. Do you see the Fed stepping in, pausing QT, \\nmaybe even initiating some treasury purchases? Just any color would be great. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nYeah. But again, I mean, we have sticky inflation. We had that before. I personally have told you all, I don\\'t think that\\'s going to go away, and that \\nrelates to that. Obviously, the U.S. dollar still is the reserve currency, and that isn\\'t going to change, though some people may feel slightly \\ndifferently about it. And the Fed – we\\'ve been inconsistent. There will be a kerfuffle of the treasury markets because of all the rules and \\nregulations. I\\'ve told you that consistently. It happened in COVID, it happened before, it happened. That will happen. And then when that \\nhappens, the Fed will step in. That\\'s what happens. And they\\'re not going to do it now because you don\\'t have all those issues yet. They\\'ll do it \\nwhen they start to panic a little bit, and we don\\'t know if and when that\\'s going to happen, and we\\'ll see. \\n \\nBut the notion that the 10-year Treasury has to go down is a false notion. If we look at history in prior times, when we have huge global deficits. \\nBack in the \\'70s, in the \\'60s, the guns and butter. And tariffs, at least our economists think will be inflationary to 0.5% or something like that. So \\nwe\\'ll have to wait and see and deal with it. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nEbrahim Poonawala \\nAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Q \\nThank you. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nFor most – mostly haven\\'t dealt with this stuff before, and you\\'re going to see a lot of stuff taking place shortly in the next couple of months, and \\nthen we\\'ll know. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nEbrahim Poonawala \\nAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Q \\nGot it. Thank you so much. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nOperator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. You may proceed. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJim Mitchell \\nAnalyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC  Q \\nHey, good morning. Jeremy, just on – with four – three to four cuts sort of mostly in the back half, June to December, how do you think about \\nthe trajectory of NII this year? Is there a little more pressure towards the end of the year into 2026? Just trying to think of that around that \\ntrajectory and jumping off point into next year. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nYes. It\\'s funny, Jim, because I was asked on the press call, how come we\\'re not like suspending guidance or whatever? And my answer was \\nlike... \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\n \\n \\n  13 \\nJim Mitchell \\nAnalyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC  Q \\nRight. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\n...well, whatever. We give guidance and we do our best, and it\\'s contingent on a variety of external variables, and we always make our guidance \\ncontingent on that. So in that context... \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nand the yield curve you\\'re using... \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nYeah, yeah, yeah. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\n...which we know will not happen. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nYeah. And the particular nuance, as you\\'ll recall from last quarter, where we went into some detail about the various drivers of the NII outlook, \\nincluding a little bit of a suggestion about the quarterly trajectory is that it\\'s both the timing of rates and the – our expected evolution of deposit \\ngrowth in the different businesses and how card revolve and how that was all going to interact, producing a potential trough in different \\nmoments and then so on and so forth. \\n \\nI think that given everything that\\'s going on on that one, probably we\\'ll wait for next quarter to give you any more color on that. Certainly, the \\nback-loaded cuts, all else equal, from a run-rate perspective, introduced a little bit of a headwind on an exit rate going into next year. We\\'ll just \\nhave to see how the balances play out through the next three quarters. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJim Mitchell \\nAnalyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC  Q \\nRight. And maybe just to... \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nIt will not happen that way, and we have a lot of options in what we want to do to change our exposure to interest rate. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJim Mitchell \\nAnalyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC  Q \\nRight. And maybe just on that point on volumes and deposits, obviously, this kind of volatility tends to drive – as corporates and investors go to \\ncash, tends to drive higher deposits. Did you see that trend in March and particularly in April? What are the trends like in the deposit side of the \\nequation? \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\n \\n \\n  14 \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nIt’s a little hard to tell, to be honest. It is true that wholesale deposits this quarter outperformed for us relative to our expectations. I don\\'t think I \\ncan say with any confidence that that\\'s a result of the environment that we\\'re in. So I think next quarter will probably be a better time to assess \\nthat. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nI\\'ll just – I\\'ll say it may not be deposits. It may be treasury bills or various other things. And what you\\'ve seen which is different, it\\'s not the risk \\noff trade in the 10-year. That is fundamentally different this time. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJim Mitchell \\nAnalyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC  Q \\nRight. Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nThanks. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nOperator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nBetsy L. Graseck \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nThanks. Good morning, Jamie. Good morning, Jeremy. Two questions. One for Jamie, just to kick off. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nGood morning. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nBetsy L. Graseck \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nJamie, you\\'ve been through many cycles. And I think we\\'re all interested in understanding how you think this next cycle is likely to progress. \\nAnd I\\'m wondering, is there anything that you\\'ve seen in the past that looks like this, or that you would suggest if any slowdown coming \\nforward, is it more likely to be similar to what kind of prior cycle you\\'ve seen? \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nAn almost impossible answer. We look at all the cycles. And you know we prepare for a full range of outcomes. We\\'re not – I don\\'t personally \\nlike predicting what the future is going to hold. But I do – I\\'ve pointed out over and over, there\\'s a lot of issues out there. I think some of those \\nissues, you are going to see them resolve, for better or for worse, in the next four months. \\n \\nSo maybe when we\\'re doing this call next quarter, we won\\'t have to be guessing. We\\'ll actually know what the effect of some of these things was \\nwith some predictability and stuff like that. But it\\'s – the result in a bank is almost always the same, which is volatile markets, credit losses go \\nup, people get more conservative, investments go down, what looks like a recession. Is it mild or hard? I don\\'t know and – but we are – I\\'ve been \\nquite cautious, and you can see in our capital, our liquidity, our position, our balance sheet. And so we\\'re prepared. But we do all that so we can  \\n \\n \\n \\n  15 \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nserve our clients through thick or thin. We\\'re not guessing about what the future is going to hold. Obviously, if you look at our numbers, we \\nhave the margins and capability to get through just about anything. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nBetsy L. Graseck \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nExcellent. Okay. No, thank you for that. And then... \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nBut Betsy, this is different, okay? This is different. This is the global economy, and please read my Chairman\\'s Letter. The most important thing \\nto me is the Western world stays together economically when we get through all this and militarily to keep the world safe and free for \\ndemocracy. That is the most important thing. I really almost don\\'t care fundamentally about what the economy does in the next two quarters. \\nThat isn\\'t that important. We\\'ll get through that. We\\'ve had recessions before and all that. It\\'s the ultimate outcome. What\\'s the goal? How can \\nwe get there? And it\\'s literally that. I mean – and the China issue is a major issue. I don\\'t know how that\\'s going to turn out. We obviously have to \\nfollow the law of the land, but it\\'s a significant change that we\\'ve never seen in our lives. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nBetsy L. Graseck \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nOkay. Thank you so much for that. And yes, looking forward to the next four months and clarity coming. So then one for Jeremy. Question on \\nthe wholesale loans. I\\'m going into this because I noticed your average loan growth, I think it was running at about 2% year-on-year. And then \\nend of period loans was up 5% and wholesale loans was up 7%. So I\\'m just wondering if there was some line drawdowns at quarter end. And it\\'s \\na broader question on just liquidity. Do you see your customers looking for more liquidity? Are they drawing down lines? And maybe if you \\ncould speak to liquidity in the front end of the market, that would be helpful, too. Thank you. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nYeah, it\\'s a good question, Betsy. So a couple of things. One is in our soundings of our wholesale clients during sort of the moments of peak \\nuncertainty, we did hear them talking about wanting to focus on shoring up liquidity. Interestingly, I actually asked the question like a day ago, \\nwhether we were seeing draws, meaningfully observable draws from clients. And the answer to that question was no, at least not yet. So, I don\\'t \\nknow what to make of that, but perhaps it suggests that we do not see that level of heightened anxiety that people are more just focusing on \\naddressing their supply chain issues right now. Yeah. So on wholesale loans. \\n \\nBeyond that, I don\\'t think there\\'s that much of a story. Now we\\'re seeing a bit more growth in sort of like Markets loans as opposed to traditional \\nC&I loans in the current moment, but that\\'s neither here nor there. Did you have – yeah, you asked – what did you ask also, front end of the yield \\ncurve, liquidity? \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nBetsy L. Graseck \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nYes, just in... \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nWas that your question? \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\n \\n \\n  16 \\nBetsy L. Graseck \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\n...money markets, Fed funds, the front end seemed to suggest... \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nYeah. What we\\'ve heard from our Markets colleagues is that that\\'s actually functioning quite smoothly. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nBetsy L. Graseck \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nOkay. Thank you. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nThanks \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nOperator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nMike Mayo \\nAnalyst, Well Fargo Securities LLC  Q \\nHey, Jamie, you just said on this call, there\\'s a \"Deep recognition of flaws\" by the new regulatory regime. And can you put – you or Jeremy, put \\nsome meat on the bones as far as what\\'s been an ideal scenario? You keep the safety and soundness of the system, but you rid all – as much \\nred tape and bureaucracy as possible. How much could expenses potentially decline? I assume you pass on some of that to customers and \\nyou\\'d keep some of that, and the regulators would save money. So, some meat on the bones about the potential concrete savings from \\nderegulation. \\n \\nBut before that, the negative, which you highlight in the press release and the Chairman Letter about trade wars, Jamie, you went from trade \\nwars \"Get over it\" to this week say, \"Do something.\" So just as far as the tariff journey, what were you initially expecting to what happened and \\ndo you really think next earnings call we\\'ll be through most of the uncertainty? Thanks. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nYeah. No, I don\\'t think we\\'ll necessarily be through all the uncertainty. I think you\\'ll just know a lot more. And my quote was about, get over it. I \\nwish I hadn\\'t said it. I was specifically referring to tariffs relating to protecting national security. National security is paramount. All things \\nshould be subordinated to it. You may need tariffs to help fix some of the problems related to national security. National security is a small part \\nof trade, so – and it\\'s rare earths, penicillin, medical ingredients, certain types of – obviously, you\\'ve heard about semiconductors. That was my \\nquote about, get over it. I did not change my view about it. \\n \\nI would like to see the administration negotiate trade deals. I think they\\'ll be good for everybody, and they want to do it too. They\\'ve said they \\nwant to do it. They\\'ve said they\\'re having conversations with 70, 80 different people. And so I do think if the regulators change regulations, it \\nwill free up capital and liquidity to finance the system. And I don\\'t – I wouldn\\'t expect an expense drawdown that you\\'re going to see. There will \\nbe thousands – hundreds of people, maybe, but it\\'s not going to be passed on. But it will reduce net-net the cost of liquidity and the cost of \\nloans and the cost of mortgages, if it\\'s done right. \\n \\nI specifically pointed out the mortgage issue in my Chairman\\'s letter this year about if they do some of these reforms, the cost of mortgages \\nwould come down 70 basis points. If I were them, I\\'d be focusing on that right now. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\n \\n \\n  17 \\nMike Mayo \\nAnalyst, Well Fargo Securities LLC  Q \\nNo, and you also mentioned hundreds of billions of dollars of extra lending if you reduce the CET1 ratio, I guess, back down by one-fifth. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nIf you do all – you have to fix LCR, G-SIFI, CCAR, SLR, and I think would free up hundreds of billions of dollars for JPMorgan annually of various \\ntypes of lending to the system. Some would be markets, some would be middle market loans, et cetera. And I pointed out, if you wanted to look \\nat the big numbers, that loans to deposits are now 70% for the banking system writ large. That used to be 100%, and the reason for that isn\\'t – \\nit\\'s not just capital. It is also LCR, it is also G-SIFI, also – and the question you should ask because you are very smart, Mike, is could you have \\nthe same – and I believe you have a safer system, lend more money, have more liquidity, eliminate bank runs, eliminate what happened to First \\nRepublic and Silicon Valley, and you could accomplish all of that with completely rational and thoughtful regulations. That\\'s what I would like to \\nsee them do. I don\\'t know what\\'s going to happen. We\\'re going to... \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nMike Mayo \\nAnalyst, Well Fargo Securities LLC  Q \\nOne short... \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nYou can read our – I think our NPRs are public and stuff like that. And so they should do that. Just make a better system. Or you have the best in \\nthe world. We\\'ve kind of started to cripple it slowly. If you don\\'t – I\\'d say, you look at these rules and regulations. See Europe. If that\\'s where we \\nwant to go. Let\\'s just go there. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nMike Mayo \\nAnalyst, Well Fargo Securities LLC  Q \\nOne short follow-up. Just first quarter, you mentioned good credit, good trading, good EPS beat. I\\'m not sure anyone cares. They\\'re worried \\nmore about the things we\\'re talking about here. But in terms of the risk of being an international company, an international U.S. company \\nduring trade wars. And I know JPMorgan is a firm that likes to partner with countries as well as communities and customers. So how do you \\nthink about that risk? How should we think about that risk? And hopefully, your voice is being heard to speed things along to whatever can be \\ndone, getting it done because you could be in the crosshairs at some point. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nYeah. I honestly add that to the list of worries. We will be in the crosshairs. That\\'s what\\'s going to happen. And it\\'s okay. We\\'re deeply \\nembedded in these other countries, people like us. But I do think some clients or some countries will feel differently about American banks, and \\nwe\\'ll just have to deal with that. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nMike Mayo \\nAnalyst, Well Fargo Securities LLC  Q \\nAll right. Thank you. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nOperator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\n \\n \\n \\n  18 \\nGlenn Schorr \\nAnalyst, Evercore Group LLC  Q \\nHi. Just one follow-up on this whole risk management/regulatory front. I see, I hear and I agree: flawed regulatory system, could be better. \\nWe\\'ve had massive volatility. The market plumbing has held in okay so far and you and others have had borderline spectacular trading results. \\nSo, has something changed? Are the systems better? Are they better able to handle your risk management, your people, the diversity of your \\nplatform better? Or are there still environments where not all volatility is good? Just curious to get your big picture thoughts. Thanks. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nI mean, maybe I\\'ll start with that one, Glenn. So, I guess, I think that your points aren\\'t mutually exclusive. Meaning, I mean, we\\'re always \\ncontinually improving the franchise. We\\'ve talked a lot about inward investment in all of our businesses, including Markets. And so we try to be \\nmore complete and invest in technology and work more closely with our clients. So I\\'m sure we\\'re kind of better at it than we were five years \\nago, as I think probably everyone is at the margin. I\\'m not sure that you can associate that with the current performance. I think these just \\nhappen to be very favorable conditions that we\\'ve managed very successfully. \\n \\nAnd to your point, I think your specific question of like is there – are there still forms of volatility that can be bad for the Markets franchise? The \\nanswer to that question is definitely yes. When you have gappy volatility with no trading volume, people paralyzed, clients unsure what to do, \\nactive managers struggling, those environments are bad. So people make fun of the kind of good volatility, bad volatility story, but whether we \\nlike it or not, it\\'s real. And in the end, we just have to manage the risks and serve the clients. And as I said earlier, we\\'re happy to see that... \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nJeremy – I agree. Jeremy, I would add to that. Volatility leads to bigger bid-ask spreads, that, all things being equal, is better. And it leads \\nsometimes to higher volumes. So you\\'ve seen really high volumes in FX and interest rate swaps, a whole bunch of different things, treasuries. \\nThat\\'s better. But as Jeremy pointed out, sometimes that kind of volatility leads to very low volumes, like you see in DCM today when you don\\'t \\nhave these bond deals where you have less trading, when you have – so it will have lower volumes in certain markets and stuff like that. And \\nhow it all filters through is almost impossible to tell. But our folks do a great job and we\\'re here to help our clients. So we know that volumes can \\ngo up or down and spreads can go up or down. \\n \\nBut the plumbing of the system, I would say the plumbing worked well during COVID too. I mean, it wasn\\'t the plumbing that was a problem and \\nwasn\\'t even a problem to go back to some of the real crises we\\'ve had, so – but you should always worry about that kind of thing, make sure it \\nstays true. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nAnd I do think that the fact that the revenue performance in this quarter is good shouldn\\'t make us lose focus on the importance of the larger \\nfixes around financial resource deployment by regulated banks to supporting the capital markets ecosystem. Everything Jamie\\'s been talking \\nabout SLR, LCR, ILST, G-SIB, Basel III Endgame, RWA, the whole panoply of items, which interacts, as we\\'ve often talked about and is miss-\\ncalibrated, it will, at the margin, make it harder for banks to serve a stabilizing function in a difficult moment. So that remains quite important as \\na policy priority. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nGlenn Schorr \\nAnalyst, Evercore Group LLC  Q \\nThat\\'s a great point. Thanks for that. Appreciate it. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nThanks, Glenn. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\n \\n \\n  19 \\nOperator : Thank you. And our final question will go to the line of Saul Martinez with HSBC. You may proceed. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nSaul Martinez \\nAnalyst, HSBC Securities (USA), Inc.  Q \\nOkay. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I guess I\\'ll ask about costs \\nsince nobody has asked it. But I guess how should we think about the cost structure and any sort of cost optimization efforts, if you do see a \\nrevenue slowdown, but not necessarily a severe downturn? I think you do have, in the $95 billion guidance, you do have a good amount of \\ngrowth penciled in for investing in bankers and branches and tech and marketing. And I guess, do you – does it make sense or under what \\nconditions would it make sense for you to maybe pull back on some of these investments? Or do you think that\\'s just completely shortsighted \\nunless we see a real significant downturn in the economy. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nYeah. So you\\'ve slightly answered your own question there, Saul, but it is nonetheless a good question. So let me unpack it a little bit. So the \\nway I think about it is there are some elements of the expense base which automatically reset as a function of the business environment. So we \\ntalk about those as volume- and revenue-related expenses. So you will see those come down as a function of the environment. It\\'s also true \\nthat there are conceivably certain investment business cases, which depending on how the environment changes, could no longer make sense \\nanalyzed in the same way that we analyze them originally, i.e., through the lens of their ability to generate long-term shareholder value through \\na long investment cycle. And so if for whatever reason the environment changes in such a way as to make certain of those investments less \\ncompelling, we would obviously adjust. \\n \\nOf course, the thing that we\\'re not going to do is stop investing in things that we still think are very compelling to our traditional long-term \\ninvestment lens, simply for the purposes of achieving a cosmetic reduction in expenses in an environment where you may or may not have a \\nreduction in revenues for unrelated reasons. As you well know, that\\'s just not how we run the company. \\n \\nThis quarter, as it happens, a question you might have is how are you managing to keep your guidance the same with what you\\'re saying about, \\nfor example, the Investment Banking outlook? But it\\'s worth noting that Investment Banking performance this quarter was actually fine. As you \\nknow, Markets performance was very strong. And there are also some ups and downs in there, I should note, including the fact that there is \\nsome sensitivity to the expense base to the strength of the dollar, or weakness in this case. And while some of that is offset in revenue, it\\'s a \\nlittle noisy, so that\\'s a factor as well. It\\'s small, but I\\'m just highlighting that there\\'s some slightly non-obvious things that are non-strategic, \\nobviously. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nCan I just add a management thing that I think is very important. And I always talk about good expenses and bad expenses and the good \\nexpenses of the bankers and branches that we think will pay off and – but there are also bad expenses, which I would put in the category of \\nbureaucracy, lack of efficiency, things you don\\'t need to do. \\n \\nAnd you can – if you go to – if you read my Chairman\\'s letter, the last section is called Management Learnings. And if you look at companies \\nthat over time fail, it\\'s almost always bureaucracy, complacency, arrogance and lack of attention to detail. And so there is – we\\'re making a – I \\nshouldn\\'t say it, but I\\'m mad at myself for not doing it sooner to spend a little more time that after COVID – the buildup in headcount, the \\nbuildup in rules and regulations, the people working or not working from home. After all of those things, we just think there\\'s more efficiency \\nhere. \\n \\nAnd I think some of the – and Mike Mayo mentioned the bit about regulation. He is right. There will be reductions in cost because rules and \\nregulations will be modified a little bit. I mean we – I pointed out resolution/recovery, which is a complete waste of time, is 80,000 pages long. \\nOkay. It will never happen that way. CCAR, which is virtually a waste of time, is 20,000 pages long. Okay. We report 1 trillion – I think it\\'s 1 trillion \\nbits of data every day or something like that to the – all the various regulators and stuff like that. There is this excessive cost built up that we – \\nthat hopefully we can get rid of and will reduce the cost of the system and – but it\\'s not the new branches, so. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  20 \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nAnd the folks here are working on, we call it, streamlining. Jenn Piepszak has got a war room going on it. We already have a significant amount \\nof saves and stuff like that, so – and we\\'re having fun doing it. It\\'s like – to me, it\\'s like exercising and eating your spinach. It\\'s what we should be \\ndoing. We haven\\'t done it for a while, so – and I apologize to my shareholders for not having done this a little bit sooner. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nSaul Martinez \\nAnalyst, HSBC Securities (USA), Inc.  Q \\nOkay. That\\'s very clear. Very helpful. Thank you. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nOkay. Thanks very much. \\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ \\nJamie Dimon \\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A \\nThank you.

Ermotti , Group Chief  Executive  Officer,  and Todd Tuckner , \\nGroup Chief  Financial  Officer \\n \\nIncluding analyst Q&A session  \\n \\nTranscript.  \\nNumbers for slides refer to the third quarter 2023 results presentation . Materials and a webcast \\nreplay are available at www.ubs.com/investors  \\n \\n \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\n \\nSlide 3 – 3Q23 key achievements  \\n \\nThank you, Sarah and good morning, everyone. During the third quarter and as we speak, we continue to see \\nan evolution of the macroeconomic outlook with opinions, forecasts and markets changing at a very rapid pace. \\nIn addition, we witnessed an even furthe r deterioration of the geopolitical landscape as a result of tragic events \\nin the Middle East. Our thoughts are with those who are suffering and have been impacted by this violence, as \\nwell as our affected employees.  \\nWhile we have been very busy executing  on our integration plans, our top priority is always to stay close to \\nclients, helping them protect their assets and position their portfolios and businesses for future opportunities.  \\nOur wealth management clients remain cautious and defensively position ed. And while some of our institutional \\nclients are taking advantage of short -term opportunities, many still remain on the sidelines.  \\nOur consistent dedication continues to be rewarded by their confidence and trust in UBS. This was \\ndemonstrated by another quarter of strong flows across GWM and P&C. In the third quarter, the first full \\nquarter since the acquisition, we made strong progress and delivered underlying profitability.  \\nWith respect to the integration of Credit Suisse, we continue to be encouraged by our achievements to date in \\nboth our planning and execution.  In terms of the lessons learned from the events in March, we welcome the recent reports issued by the Basel \\nCommittee on Banking Supervision, the Financial Stability Board and the Swiss Exper t Group on Banking \\nStability. Their findings confirmed our view that the crisis was not a result of insufficient capital or liquidity requirements.  \\nRather, the reports emphasized sustainable business models, risk -adjusted profitability, and importantly, t he \\ncritical role of robust risk management cultures and effective governance. We take comfort in these conclusions, \\nas they have been and remain core principles of UBS. Today, we are positioning UBS to be an even stronger \\nand safer global financial institu tion. It is for this reason that we remain confident the acquisition will allow us \\n \\n Page 2 of 22 \\n to deliver significant value for all of our stakeholders, notwithstanding potential macroeconomic or geopolitical \\nchallenges.  \\nSlide 4 – Strong progress amid challenging mark et conditions  \\nBriefly summarizing our results this quarter. Our strong underlying performance was driven by positive operating \\nleverage at the Group level. GWM, P&C and Asset Management all delivered underlying PBT growth. IB performance was impacted by ma rket conditions that were unfavorable to our business model and investments \\nwe expect to be accretive in future quarters.  \\nOur capital position remained strong with a CET1 ratio of 14.4% and total loss -absorbing capacity of nearly \\n200 billion. We achieved this result while incurring 2 billion in integration- related expenses and making good \\nprogress running down non- core assets.  \\nDespite our reported loss in the quarter, we incurred over 500 million in tax expense, and paid over 200 million \\nin cash taxes in Switzerland.  \\nSlide 5 – Delivering on integration priorities  \\nOur confidence in the ability to successfully integrate Credit Suisse and create substantial long- term value is \\nsupported by the strong progress we made in the third quarter.  \\nWe have now stabilized Credit Suisse and continued to grow our franchise through new client acquisition and \\nshare -of-wallet gains. In addition, our client retention and win- back strategy is working. Net new money in \\nGWM was 22 billion and our strong deposit momentum continued through the quarter.  The 33 billion in net new deposits ac ross GWM and P&C also supported our ability to reduce quarterly funding \\ncosts by 450 million through the repayment of the Public Liquidity Backstop and the ELA+  that we announced \\nin August.  \\nWe are pleased to see strong demand for UBS debt in the wholesale markets with transactions priced at similar \\nlevels to where UBS paper stood before the rescue of Credit Suisse.  \\nWe have finalized the perimeter of Non -core and Legacy, and our efforts to actively unwind positions resulted \\nin a capital release of around 1 billion.  \\nLastly, we continued to execute our plans to reduce costs in Non- core and Legacy, restructure Credit Suisse ’s \\nInvestment Bank and remove duplication s across our operations. We have already delivered around 3 billion in \\nannualized exit -rate gross cost savings. We expect to make further progress in the fourth quarter.  \\nSlide 6 -  Client trust and confidence demonstrated by strong flows in GWM and P&C  \\nSlide 6 summarizes well how quickly we have stabilized Credit Suisse, and the confidence of clients in UBS.  \\nCredit Suisse Wealth Management ’s quarterly net new money has now turned positive for the first time in a \\nyear and a half, with 3 billion in the third quarter. UBS W ealth Management ’s 18 billion in net new money is \\nthe second highest third -quarter result in over a decade.  \\nIn addition, it was satisfying to see that our efforts to win back client assets resulted in 22 billion in net new \\ndeposits from Credit Suisse clients across GWM and P&C.  \\n \\n Page 3 of 22 \\n Following our decision to integrate Credit Suisse Schweiz, we reached out to our clients to re -assure them that \\nwe remain committed to delivering the best capabilities of both institutions. In addition, we reiterated that their \\ncredit limits across both banks will remain in place.  \\nTo date, client reactions have been broadly constructive and net new deposits in P&C were positive in both \\nPersonal and Corporate banking client segments. We are particularly pleased that this was also the case in \\nSeptember, the month following our decision to integrate both franchises.  \\nSlide 7 – Accelerating the run -down of Non- core and Legacy assets  \\nIn Non- core and Legacy , we also made strong progress this quarter. 80% of the sequential reduction in NCL ’s \\ncredit and market risk risk weighted assets was d riven by actively running down positions, executed above \\nmarks. Non -operational risk weighted assets  have now been reduced by nearly one -third since 1Q23 and the \\nexpected natural run- off profile has improved by 3 billion.  \\nWhile we have some credit risk exp osure in certain local emerging markets and other more complicated bilateral \\npositions that resulted in CLEs this quarter, the key risks across the portfolio are well understood, actively managed and in most cases, well hedged.  \\nThe majority of our credit risk exposure is with high -quality borrowers. Over 75% of the exposure is rated \\ninvestment grade. This provides us with the comfort to continue to pursue our strategy to accelerate the disposal \\nof these assets in a way that optimizes value for our sharehol ders, while also protecting our clients and \\ncounterparties.  \\nThe finalized perimeter of Non -core and Legacy contains 30 billion in operational risk weighted assets . As a \\nfunction of the natural decay across the portfolio, we expect a reduction of around 50 % by the end of 2026. \\nTodd will take you through this in more detail.  \\nSlide 8 – Integration planning and execution well underway    \\nReturning to the integration, let me reiterate that the complexity is not just from managing two G -SIFI banks. \\nOur immediate priority since the transaction was announced and closed had to be on stabilizing and restructuring Credit Suisse. This will continu e to be the case until the early part of 2024.  \\nAt the same time, we are executing on our integration plans at pace, and on the left side of slide 8, you can see a selection of our recent achievements. Notably, we have established management responsibilities and operating models across business divisions and legal entities, including in our Swiss franchise.  \\nYou can also see some of our key priorities through the end of this year and beyond. This includes the merger \\nof our significant legal entities, client migrations across all of our business divisions and executing on our \\ntechnology decommissioning plans .  \\nLast but not least, we are also working toward finalizing our 3- year strategic plan, which we will present in \\nearly February.  \\n \\n \\n \\n Page 4 of 22 \\n Slide 9 – Working towar ds ~15% RoCET1  \\nAs we continue to progress our plan, the main focus has been on delivering synergies for the combined Group. \\nWe remain confident that the 2026 goals that we presented last quarter are achievable. But , as | said then, it \\nwill not be a straigh t-line journey.  \\nWe are pleased that the first phase of gross cost savings has already been executed in 2023. But I am sure we \\nall appreciate the significant costs associated with running and combining two G -SIFIs, one of which is still \\nstructurally unprof itable.  \\nFrom an operational standpoint  of view , it is clear that 2024 will be a pivotal year. Completing the merger of \\nour significant legal entities before the end of next year is a critical step to enable us to unlock the next phase \\nof our cost, capital and funding synergies, which we expect to realize in 2025 and 2026.  \\nOur enhanced scale, leading client franchises and increased future earnings power will position us for growth. \\nDisciplined execution will continue to be an important driver for  our performance and we are on track to deliver \\non our plans. We are optimistic about our future as we build an even stronger and safer version of the UBS that \\nwas called upon to stabilize the financial system in March, and one that all of our key stakeholders can be proud \\nof. \\nWith that, I hand over to Todd.  \\n \\n Page 5 of 22 \\n Todd Tuckner  \\n \\nSlide 11 – Update on reporting charges  \\n \\nThank you and good morning everyone. As Sergio highlighted, we are executing on our plans at pace. In our \\nfirst full quarter since the Credit Suisse acquisition, we ’ve delivered underlying profitability and maintained \\nstrong client momentum with impressive  net new money inflows in Global Wealth Management and net new \\ndeposit growth in our Swiss franchise.  \\nWe also made substantial progress in de -risking our Non- core and Legacy portfolio, reinforcing our balance \\nsheet for all seasons.  \\nBefore I move on to dis cussing details of our financial performance, let me describe the reporting changes we \\nimplemented this quarter and the ones we expect to introduce soon.  \\nToday, for the first time we ’re presenting the results of our performance segments on a combined basis , \\nreflecting the way we ’re managing our businesses and engaging with clients. In addition to Global Wealth \\nManagement, Personal & Corporate Banking, Asset Management and the Investment Bank, we are now \\nseparately reporting Non -Core and Legacy as well as Gr oup Items, all of which reflect the combined \\nperformance of UBS and Credit Suisse under IFRS and in US dollars.  \\nAs I said during the second quarter earnings call, our aim is to be clear and forthcoming in explaining the \\nfinancial reporting of this complex  transaction. Therefore, we ’ve introduced underlying performance metrics \\nthat primarily strip out the PPA -related pull -to-par effects from revenues in our core businesses and adjust for \\nintegration -related expenses across all performance segments.  \\nRegardi ng the pull -to-par effects in NCL, in the quarter we reclassified most of the positions that Credit Suisse ’s \\nInvestment Bank and Capital Release Unit historically accounted for on an accrual basis to fair value through P&L, as those positions in NCL are now held for sale. As a reminder, those positions gave rise to the 3.1 billion \\nin future NCL pull -to-par revenues that we flagged last quarter. Given that NCL generates revenues in various \\nways, whether from early unwinds of positions and other disposals, ma rk-to-market on its fair value book, or \\nfrom pull -to-par effects, we don ’t distinguish among the various accounting classification types. Accordingly, \\nin the quarter and going forward, all sources of NCL income, gain or loss will be treated as part of its underlying \\nperformance.  \\nAs last quarter ’s disclosed IFRS results reflect only one month of Credit Suisse ’s operating performance, to \\nimprove comparability, we ’ve prepared estimated underlying results that reflect all three months of the second \\nquarter. As I go through my remarks, unless otherwise stated, I will compare our underlying third quarter results \\nsequentially to this estimated performance in the prior quarter. We ’ll focus on sequential developments until \\nthe third quarter of 2024, when we ’ll resum e year -over-year commentary.  \\nNow, on to our planned changes. In the fourth quarter we will expand our Global Wealth Management asset \\nflows disclosure and enhance comparability with US peers. We will report net new money plus dividends and \\ninterest, as well  as disclose net new fee generating assets for the combined franchise. We intend to introduce \\na growth target for net new money, plus dividends and interest, when we present our integration KPIs and targets as part of our fourth quarter results early next year.  \\n \\n Page 6 of 22 \\n Additionally, starting from the first quarter of 2024, we expect to push out to our business divisions substantially \\nall balance sheet and P&L items that were previously retained centrally in Group Items. The only exceptions will \\nbe for group items that are not directly attributable to divisional activities, including deferred tax assets, cash \\nflow hedges, own credit and their associated P&L effects. Our business division equity attribution framework \\nwill also reflect these changes whereby the averag e levels of equity across the business divisions will more closely \\nalign to our current Group capital targets.  \\nSlide 12 – 3Q23 underlying PBT of 0.8bn, higher revenues and lower costs QoQ  \\n \\nMoving on to our financial performance on Slide 12. The quarterly profit before tax was 844 million, a 1.4 \\nbillion increase from the second quarter as we delivered strong positive operating leverage with 0.6 billion \\nhigher revenues and 0.5 billion lower operating expenses.  \\nAdditionally, CLE declined by 0.4 billion sequentially to 0.3 billion, which mainly related to Credit Suisse loans \\nwithin P&C and NCL, which I cover later in more detail. By comparison, CLE in the second quarter of 0.7 billion \\nincluded more than 0.5 billion of charges primarily related to the take -on re cognition of ECL allowances on \\nCredit Suisse ’s lending portfolios.  \\nOn a reported basis, the third quarter net loss was 785 million, as 526 million in tax expense arising in profitable \\nentities,  could not be offset by tax benefits from losses primarily gene rated by certain Credit Suisse subsidiaries. \\nWe expect our effective tax rate to remain elevated until we merge and restructure our most significant legal \\nentities. After that time, the effective tax rate should gradually return to a level below 25%, absen t the effects \\nof any remeasurement of deferred tax assets.   \\nSlide 13 – 3Q23 underlying total revenues 10.7bn, up 6% QoQ  \\n \\nMoving to Slide 13. Revenues increased by 6% this quarter to 10.7 billion driven by lower funding costs within \\nGroup Items and gains in Non- Core and Legacy as the team accelerated the unwind of certain positions at \\nattractive prices relative to book values.  \\n \\nRevenues in Group Items increased sequentially primarily due to the reduction of around 450 million in centrally -\\nheld funding costs from the Credit Suisse -related liquidity measures that were repaid and returned in the middle \\nof the third quarter. For the fourth quarter we expect an additional 100 million benefit from these actions. It is \\nworth noting that the cost of replacement funding is being absorbed by the core businesses and is reflected in \\ntheir sequential NII performance and guidance this quarter.  \\nTotal revenues reached 11.7 billion, including 958 million that we ’ve stripped out of underlying revenues. This \\namount consisted of 764 million in pull -to-par effects as well as 194 million of NII in our core businesses \\nbenefitting from the merger date el imination of the unrealized loss balance associated with Credit Suisse ’s cash \\nflow hedge program.  \\nSlide 14 – Pull to par overview and revenue recognition  \\n \\nOn Slide 14 we show the details of pull -to-par and similar effects that we expect to recognize in fu ture quarters. \\nThe pull -to-par starting balance as of transaction close was 9.3 billion, excluding the 3.1 billion reclassification \\nin NCL that I described earlier. Considering the pull -to-par accretion of 1.1 billion recognized since the merger \\ndate, incl uding 0.8 billion this quarter, the remaining balance that will accrete into income over future quarters \\nis expected to be around 8.2 billion.  \\n \\n \\n Page 7 of 22 \\n We expect the majority of this balance to accrete into income by the end of 2026, barring the impact of any \\nearly unwinds, with 500 million expected next quarter. We also expect to recognize around 900 million of \\nadditional NII in GWM and P&C relating to the eliminated cash flow hedge item I mentioned a few moments ago, with 150 million expected in 4Q.  \\n \\nAs a remin der, these effects are stripped out of our underlying revenues with about half being CET1 capital \\naccretive. I would also point out that we continue to expect total pull -to-par revenues, including the reclassified \\nNCL and post -2026 recognized portions, to broadly offset the costs to achieve the greater than 10 billion in \\ngross savings we described last quarter. Having said this, like in the third quarter, we expect there will be timing \\nmismatches in the recognition of these reported revenues and expenses, resulting in headwinds to our reported \\nresults, particularly in the fourth quarter and throughout 2024.  \\n \\nSlide 15 – 3Q23 underlying operating expenses 9.6bn, down 5% QoQ  \\n \\nMoving to Slide 15. Operating expenses for the Group decreased to 9.6 billion, down 5%  as our cost savings \\ninitiatives take effect, partially offset by reinvestments to help grow our core businesses.  \\nProgress on our restructuring actions led to 2 billion in integration- related expenses. Roughly half of these \\nexpenses was related to personn el costs, including severance payments, salaries of employees fully dedicated \\nto integration matters, and the costs of retaining key personnel. The other half was related to non -personnel \\nmatters, including real estate impairments and depreciation, onerous contract charges, and consulting and legal \\nfees.  \\nFor the fourth quarter, we expect integration -related expenses in excess of 1 billion, although certain additional \\ncosts to achieve may arise if we see opportunities to accelerate savings.  While we manage our integration to achieve overall cost reductions without specific headcount targets, I would \\nnote that our combined workforce fell by over 4 thousand in the quarter, bringing year -to-date reductions to \\n13 thousand, or down 9% versus the workforce of bot h banks as of the end of 2022. Across our cost -savings \\ninitiatives, we ’ve achieved around 3 billion to date in gross run- rate cost saves with further progress expected \\nin the fourth quarter.   \\nSlide 16 – Diversifying sources of funding and maintaining a st rong liquidity position  \\n \\nTurning to Slide 16. In the quarter we maintained a strong capital position with around 200 billion of TLAC and \\na CET1 capital ratio of 14.4% mainly as we reduced RWA from the active run- down in our NCL portfolio, which \\noffset redu ctions in our CET1 capital in the quarter. Our CET1 leverage ratio increased to 4.9% at the end of \\nthe quarter.  \\nAs we previously guided, we expect to maintain a CET1 capital ratio of around 14% throughout the integration \\ntimeline, even if our reported per formance over the coming quarters remains affected by the costs of winding \\ndown the NCL unit and the work needed to achieve cost synergies in our core businesses.  \\nDuring the quarter we issued 4.5 billion of US dollar TLAC attracting very strong demand, an d pricing at pre -\\nacquisition spreads, in a clear sign of fixed income investor confidence in our name. To further diversify our \\nsources of funding, we successfully placed 3 billion in SEC -registered OpCo and, just after the quarter, 820 \\nmillion Swiss francs in UBS ’s inaugural Swiss covered bond issue, both attractively priced.  \\n \\n Page 8 of 22 \\n Regarding liquidity, we maintained a prudent profile in the quarter with an LCR of nearly 200%, supported by \\n33 billion in total deposit inflows. I would note that these strong deposit inflows across Global Wealth \\nManagement and Personal & Corporate Banking increased our overall deposit coverage ratio.  \\nGoing forward, we expect to continue to operate with a prudent LCR to comply with the revisions to the Swiss \\nLiquidity Ordinance that will come into effect on January 1, 2024.  \\nRegarding the Swiss National Bank’ s recently announced changes to its minimum reserve requirements and \\nsight deposit remuneration policies that take effect n ext month, we expect an annualized reduction of around \\n80 million Swiss francs to our NII, of which two -thirds will impact P&C and one -third GWM.  \\n  \\nSlide 17 – Global Wealth Management  \\n \\nTurning to the performance in our businesses, beginning on slide 17. In Global Wealth Management we \\ncontinued strong momentum with 22 billion in net new money inflows across all regions. We saw particularly \\nstrong inflows in both APAC and EMEA, with 13 and 8 billion in net new money, respectively. Importantly, our \\nCredit Suisse Wealth M anagement business attracted quarterly net inflows for the first time since the beginning \\nof 2022. In the quarter, we also attracted 25 billion of net new deposits, including 17 billion from the Credit Suisse wealth side.  \\nThese impressive flows are a true testament to the trust our clients continue to place in us. They also reflect the \\nsuccess of our clear and decisive win-back, retention, and client -acquisition actions, as well as intensified client \\nengagement levels since the deal ’s completi on. We expect to further build on this momentum as the value \\nproposition of the combined firm becomes more tangible to our clients. For instance, all of our clients now have \\naccess to the UBS House View from our CIO, and our wealth management product and s olution offerings are \\nbeing unified and aligned across the platforms.  \\nAs mentioned, from next quarter we will report net new money plus dividends and interest, as well as net new \\nfee generating assets for the combined franchise. In the third quarter, infl ows based on this new definition \\nwere 39 billion, and net new fee generating assets in solely the UBS portion of our wealth business were 21 billion, with positive flows across all regions.  \\nMoving on to GWM ’s P&L. Profit before tax was 1.1 billion, over 4 0% higher sequentially, driven by a reduction \\nin costs and credit loss expenses with roughly flat revenues. Excluding the impact of CLE, which included a \\nsignificant acquisition -related ECL charge last quarter, underlying profit before tax increased by around 20%, \\nsupported by lower underlying operating expenses.  \\nThis quarter GWM revenues of 5.5 billion were broadly flat as increases in recurring fees were offset by a decline \\nin NII. Combined net interest income was down 3%, on an underlying basis and excl uding FX, reflecting \\ncontinued deposit mix effects due to rotation into higher -yielding deposits, and ongoing deleveraging. This was \\npartially offset by sequentially higher deposit balances that serve to close the funding gap in the business and strengthen  the structural profile of our balance sheet. For the fourth quarter we expect a mid-single -digit \\npercentage decline in NII mainly from continuing deposit mix shifts.  \\nCredit loss expenses in the quarter across GWM were 2 million.  \\nOperating expenses declined by 0.2 billion to 4.4 billion mainly driven by lower personnel expenses as reduced \\nheadcount levels, which we expect to continue sequentially, began to benefit our underlying earnings.  \\n \\n Page 9 of 22 \\n Although it ’s early days in terms of synergy realization in GWM, we are already seeing progress from our \\nintegration efforts. The division ’s underlying cost/income ratio in the third quarter dropped by around 3 \\npercentage points to 80 %.   \\nSlide 18 – Personal & Corporate Banking (CHF)  \\n \\nTurning to Personal & Corporate Banking on slide 18. Profit before tax increased by 0.1 billion to 773 million \\nSwiss francs, mainly driven by a decrease in credit loss expenses. Excluding CLE, P&C ’s PBT w as up slightly \\nquarter on quarter.  \\nRevenues increased to 2.2 billion. With the announcement of the Swiss integration at the end of August, the \\nbusiness is highly focused on client engagement and deposit win- back. Early indications are encouraging as \\nevide nced by the stability of the revenue line, the resilience of business volume and the commencement of \\ndeposit returns.  \\nNet interest income decreased by 4% despite the narrowing funding gap from net new deposit inflows, which \\nmainly came from our corporate c lients. A primary driver of the sequential decline this quarter was the additional \\ncost of restoring the structural funding profile of the combined business to UBS ’s NSFR standards.  \\nFor the fourth quarter, we expect a low single digit percentage decline in  NII mainly due to rotation to higher \\nyielding deposits.  \\nCredit loss expense in the quarter was 154 million Swiss francs almost exclusively from two factors related to \\nCredit Suisse ’s Swiss Bank. First, we recognized CLE on [Edit: for credit- impaired ] loans, mainly to corporate \\ncounterparties that were already impaired on the merger date and deteriorated further this quarter, as well as \\nnewly defaulted positions. Second, we moved to Stage 2, and provisioned in line with UBS ’s coverage ratio \\nstandards, all loans including those as of the merger date on Credit Suisse ’s watchlist as well as those lending \\nexposures that experienced a significant increase in credit risk during the third quarter.  \\nUnderlying operating expenses were roughly unchanged  at 1.2 billion on lower personnel and litigation \\nexpenses, with the underlying cost/income ratio down quarter on quarter to 57%.  \\nSlide 19 – Asset Management  \\n \\nMoving to slide 19. In Asset Management the underlying profit before tax increased to 156 million on higher \\nrevenues and lower costs. Revenues were slightly higher at 755 million, with increases in net management fees \\ndriven by market performance and FX, and higher performance fees from our hedge fund businesses.  \\nOperating expenses decreased to 599 mi llion mainly due to lower personnel expenses.  \\nNet new money in the quarter was negative 1 billion driven by Credit Suisse outflows, which continue to taper \\nsince the acquisition, with inflows expected to gradually return from proactive client engagement. It ’s worth \\nnoting that the UBS side of the business attracted net new money inflows this quarter in a challenging \\nenvironment for asset managers. We saw strong demand for our Money Market, SMA and Real Estate & Private \\nMarkets solutions, partly  offset by client asset allocation shifts away from China, Equities, and Hedge Funds in \\nthe current market dynamic.  \\nNet new money excluding money markets and associates was negative 8.3 billion.   \\n \\n \\n Page 10 of 22 \\n Slide 20 – Investment Bank  \\nTurning to the Investment Bank performance on slide 20. Since the UBS IB has taken on only select parts of \\nCredit Suisse ’s investment bank and the latter saw little activity in the second quarter, we compare the results \\nof the combined IB with standalone performance in the prior year ’s third quarter.  \\nWe will continue to offer year- over-year comparisons to standalone UBS IB performance in the quarters ahead \\nwhile also providing commentary on sequential developments until the third quarter of 2024, as with the other business divisions.  \\nThe operating loss of 116 million was a result of additional costs related to the retained portion of Credit Suisse ’s \\nInvestment Bank, which was only partially offset by standalone profit before tax in UBS IB, as market conditions \\nremain challenging for our business model.  \\nUnderlying revenues, which exclude 251 million of pull -to-par accretion and other effects, declined 6% year -\\nover-year to 1.9 billion amid muted client activity due to ongoing concerns around terminal interest rates and \\ngeopolitical events. Volatility across asset classes declined significantly from a year ago and global fee pools \\nremained depressed.  \\nAgainst this backdrop, Global Banking revenues increased 36% with particular strength in leveraged capital \\nmarkets and strong performance in EME A. Advisory outperformed the global fee pool, and was further \\nsupported by revenues from the heritage Credit Suisse franchise.  \\nGlobal Markets revenues declined 15% from a very strong third quarter, reflecting lower revenues across macro \\nproducts and equity  derivatives. This was partly offset by growth in Financing supported by increased client \\nbalances.  \\nOverall, revenues generated from the retained portion of Credit Suisse ’s investment bank were 113 [edit: 131] \\nmillion this quarter, primarily in Advisory as well as Derivatives and Solutions.  \\nOperating expenses rose 27%, predominantly from additional pers onnel costs related to the retained portions \\nof Credit Suisse ’s Investment Bank, as well as higher technology costs and FX.  \\nAs we manage the Investment Bank integration, we remain disciplined in our resource management. RWAs at \\n23% of the Group’ s resources excluding NCL were roughly unchanged sequentially.  \\nLooking ahead, as the majority of the onboarding of our colleagues and positions to UBS IB systems is planned for completion by the end of the year, we expect revenues to ramp up over the course of 2024. Given this \\ntiming, in addition to current market conditions and seasonality, we expect continued pressure on our underlying profitability in the fourth quarter.  \\nSlide 21 – Non- core and Legacy  \\n \\nMoving to Non- Core and Legacy on Slide 21. Excluding integrat ion-related expenses, NCL generated an \\nunderlying operating loss of 1 billion.  \\nQuarterly revenues of 350 million consisted mainly of gains from the early unwind of loan commitments while \\nthe portion of the NCL portfolio that remains on the accrual method of accounting was left broadly unchanged \\nthis quarter given recovery expectations on the underlying lending positions.  \\n \\n Page 11 of 22 \\n Credit loss expense was 125 million. Additional provisions of 71 million reflect application of the same extended \\ncredit watchlist approa ch I described earlier in the context of P&C. We also saw 54 million of charges from \\nStage 3 and purchased credit -impaired loans that deteriorated further in the quarter.  \\nUnderlying operating expenses reached 1.2 billion, split roughly equally between per sonnel and non- personnel \\ncosts. Integration -related expenses of 918 million consisted of onerous contract charges, real estate -related \\nexpenses, and personnel costs linked to headcount reductions and retention.  \\nFor the fourth quarter, we expect the underl ying cost base in Non- Core and Legacy to decrease further from \\nadditional staff reductions whose costs are directly housed within, or allocated to, NCL.  As Sergio mentioned, in the quarter we took decisive actions to reduce RWAs. 5 of the total 6 billion reduction \\nresulted from active de -risking of exposures across the array of NCL portfolios. LRD was reduced by 52 billion, \\nincluding 15 billion resulting from lower HQLA requirements and 12 billion from the accounting reclassification \\nof loan commitments fr om accrual to fair value.  \\nDuring the quarter, we completed the initial impact assessment on our operational risk RWA from the final \\nBasel 3 standard, which comes into effect on January 1, 2025. Based on this initial study, we expect Group op \\nrisk RWA to re main broadly unchanged at the current level of 145 billion.  \\nWe also determined on the basis of our impact assessment initial levels of RWA to apportion to each of our \\nbusiness divisions, including NCL. The 30 billion of operational risk RWA assigned to NC L this quarter is expected \\nto diminish over time as a function of two considerations: the run- down of the NCL portfolio and the removal \\nof certain legacy litigation matters given the lapse of time. On the basis of natural roll -off in both contexts, we \\nexpect operational risk RWA in NCL to decrease to around 14 billion by the end of 2026.  \\nAs a reminder, we continue to expect a roughly 5% increase from day -1 effects in 2025 from other final Basel \\n3 considerations, mainly FRTB.  \\nSlide 22 – On track to deliver on our integration goals  \\n \\nAs we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect many of the drivers of underlying profitability to continue \\nto progress. In particular, we expect underlying operating expenses to decline sequentially as our core businesses \\nrealize incremental synergies, and  NCL remains focused on actively running down its portfolio to release capital \\nand accelerate cost saves.  \\n \\nIn addition to the NII expectations that I described earlier, transactional activity may be affected by seasonal \\nfactors as well as client sentiment  in response to the geopolitical landscape.  \\nDespite these elements, we are executing on our integration plans at pace and remain on track to achieve our goals of around a 15% return on CET1 capital and a cost /income ratio of less than 70% by the end of 2026.  \\nWith that, let ’s open for questions.  \\n \\n Page 12 of 22 \\n Analyst Q&A (CEO and CFO)  \\n \\nStefan Stalman n, Autonomous Research \\nYes. Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you very much for the presentation. I have two questions and they \\nmay be linked. The first regarding the  outstanding SNB funding. I don' t think there 's any update in the \\ndisclosure material on where the number has moved to. I think the last disclosed number was CHF 38 billion at the end of August. Could you provide an update here?  \\nAnd possibly related to thi s, it looks to me looking at SNB data that there has not been a lot further reduction \\nof SNB funding after August, in September. Is that a good interpretation of the data? And is there any \\nconnection here between your management of the SNB funding and the new Liquidity Ordinance that has \\ncome into play – that will come into place in January? And is it possible for you to give us a guidance on how \\nyour liquidity ratios will look like on the 1st of January under this new Liquidity Ordinance in Switzerland, \\nplease? Thank you . \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nHi, Stefan. Thanks for your questions. So, in terms of the outstanding SNB funding, no, it 's – we still have the \\n– that funding levels are still unchanged at this stage. We are working through our business plans and as well \\nas our funding plans. And we 'll consider the ability to repay some or all of that over the course of the coming \\nmonths, but your read was correct.  \\nIn connection with that funding and the Liq. Ordinance, no. I 'd say there 's no specific connection with that. \\nAnd we 're not maintaining that funding, particularly in respect of satisfying the Liquidity Ordinance per se. \\nThat said, the LCR guidance that you 're looking for, as we say, will remain prudent. So you can expect it to \\nremain at levels not terribly far away  from where we finished 3Q at.  \\nStefan Stalmann, Autonomous Research  \\nGreat that’ s very helpful, thank you.  \\nGiulia Miott o, Morgan Stanley  \\nYes. Hi. Good morning. Two questions from me. The first one on capital distribution. I know it 's very early and \\nI guess you will comment on Q4, but what are the stepping stone s that we should look out for before you can \\nresume a buyback? That 's my first question.  \\nAnd then, the second question is with respect to costs. In the quarter, there was an excellent delivery on costs \\nand the USD 3 billion target by year end has already been achieved. So basically, where do we go from here? \\nCan we assume that this steady path of cost saves can continue? Or will there kind of be a pause until there is \\nthe legal merger because you have already basically extracted as much as you could of the low hanging fruit? \\nThank you.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nOkay. Thank you. So in respect of the capital distribution plan or capital return plans, as you pointed out, \\nyou're going to have to be patient. You know, is for the time being I just can reiterate that we are still looking \\nto have a progressive cash dividend policy that will be implemented. And for the rest, you need to have – \\n \\n Page 13 of 22 \\n what you need to see is the visibility with the plan. So we are finalizing the three -year plan and that will allow \\nus to really calibrate capital returns.  \\nI just want to reiterate, I  still believe at this stage, although the plan is not finished, that capital returns and \\nshare buybacks is not a matter of years. In my point of view, it could be a matter of quarters. But without \\nhaving the final plan, it 's difficult to really make a fin al statement. But that will be addressed in February.  \\nAnd somehow, it 's linked to your second question because, of course, I 'm not so sure, I would define the \\nprogress we 've made so far as low hanging fruit. But I think that it takes efforts and time to go  through this. I \\ndo believe that we still have costs that can be taken out during 2024, regardless of what you are pointing out \\nbeing the critical issue is the legal entity merger. The legal entity merger is the triggering point that allow us \\nto go to the next level of cost reduction and synergy realizations from an operational standpoint  of view, but \\nalso from an IT stand point of view.  \\nSo 2024, as Todd mentioned, is the – and I also remarked, is a pivotal year, is probably the one time in which \\nwe're goin g to incur the most cost s in order to achieve the synergies that we 'll achieve in 2025 and 2026. So, \\nyou see how the two questions are somehow linked.  \\nGiulia Miotto, Morgan Stanley  \\nThank you.  \\nAndrew Coombs, Citigroup  \\nGood morning. Two questions from me, please. Firstly, on the GWM net interest income trajectory. Thank \\nyou for the commentary in your prepared remarks. I think you said after a 3% decline in Q3, you expected \\nmid-single -digit percentage decline in Q4 and that there 's an ongoing deposit mix shift. So that seems to be \\naccelerating rather than decelerating. So can you give us any indication of how much longer you think that trend could continue for? Do you think now that we 're at peak rates , if anything, that should slow as we go \\ninto 2024? And also, if there 's any implications from your broader deposit pricing that 's also influencing that \\nsequential NII decline. That 's the first question.  \\nSecond question, there 's been quite a lot of media commentary over the pa st week ahead of the Too Big To \\nFail review coming out in spring next year. I think there 's been some explicit discussion around potentially \\nintroducing more exit fees or more notice periods around deposits. So, anything you could say with regards to \\nthat and also what that means for your competitive positioning versus international peers? Thank you.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nYeah. Thanks, Andrew. On the first in terms of GWM NII trajectory, I think you captured it right in terms of \\nguidance around a mid- single digit de cline owing to deposit mix shifts and whether that seems like an \\nacceleration. I 'd comment that I think what we 're seeing is a bit of a broadening of that dynamic more across \\nthe globe.  \\nWe saw in most of 2023 that dynamic being very significantly driven by  moves from sweep deposits into \\nhigher yielding deposits in the US. And we saw less of that in Europe and APAC, as well as in Switzerland. And so while we 're seeing the US taper now, both in the current quarter and as we look ahead, we' re seeing \\na bit of a n expansion of that dynamic in other parts of the globe, and that 's what 's sort of driving that.  \\n \\n Page 14 of 22 \\n As I look out into 2024, we 're doing that work now. We 'll come back with a view during February with a view \\non full year 2024. I would just conclude on the poi nt saying, no, I don' t see pricing having an impact. I mean, \\nthis is just a response to the current rate environment as clients are undergoing cash sorting across our client \\nbase.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nSo in respect of what you mentioned and changes in the law  or regulations around liquidity. I think I can only \\nsay that it' s pretty difficult to track all the rumors, speculations and ideas that are coming up, almost daily.  \\nOn the Swiss media, I think that I can only tell you that, that at this stage what stands is that even the Finance Minister took an official stance on the matter. I mean, those are speculation s. I don 't believe this is going to be \\npart of the package. I think that  - I'm convinced that Switzerland will keep its standards in terms of allowing –  \\nor responding to the crisis in March, not only the one in Switzerland, but broadly speaking, with following the \\nrecommendation that it will be set by the FSB and other bodies. A nd in that sense, I don' t see us being \\nparticularly disadvantaged compared to any other jurisdictions in terms of a Liquidity Ordinance. So, I guess \\nthat we will follow up and I think it 's going to still take months and months before the full analysis of w hat \\nhappened will translate into concrete actions.  \\nAdam Terelak, Mediobanca  \\nGood morning. Thanks for the questions. I had a one big picture question on revenues and then a follow -up \\non the operational risk RWA. Big picture, your revenues at the minute are annualizing to low -40 billions or so. \\nClearly, your target has a number, which is probably USD 50 billion- plus. Just want to understand how you \\nsee the revenue bridge from here through to 2027 and what the key moving parts should be, particularly in \\nthe co ntext of some of your GWM trends, which at the minute seem to be down before we go back up.  \\nAnd then, secondly, on operational risk, I just want to understand some of the assumptions that are going into your Basel IV guidance there. Clearly there' s some un certainty around ILM. There 's a bit of uncertainty about \\nwhat losses to use in that standardized calculation. So what losses from the Credit Suisse business are you \\nhaving to carry forward and how does that impact your operational risk RWA? And then, final ly, can I just clarify \\non the Basel 3.1 finalization guidance, is that 5% ex . any moves in operational risk? Thank you.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nThank you, Adam. So in terms of revenues, I 'm not so sure we ever indicated that we have a USD 50 billion \\nplus revenue . I don 't know where this figure is coming from. What I remember saying back in August is that \\nour targets, our ambitions for 2026 are not based on blue sky scenarios on revenues. So, if anything, I guided \\nto the contrary of that.  \\nSo we are definitely focused on costs and we are definitely also focusing on the denominator. So we need to basically focus on managing and utilizing in a better way the resources and the risk -weighted assets that we \\nhave right now.  \\nI have to go back to the critical  point. Mission number one we have had in the last six months and in the \\nforeseeable future is to restructure Credit Suisse, okay? And then we 're going to talk about synergies and then \\nwe're going to talk about growth. But , before we talk about growth of t he top line, we need to restructure \\nand reset the basis. And in that sense, believe me, we are not counting on blue sky scenarios and that figure is \\nnot really our figure.  \\n \\n Page 15 of 22 \\n Adam Terelak, Mediobanca  \\nCan I ask for a better landing point then?  \\nSergio P. Ermott i \\nWell, the landing point you will see it in February.  \\nAdam Terelak, Mediobanca  \\nOkay. Thank you.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nAdam, on your second question in terms of op risk RWA and modeling, as I mentioned, we did an initial \\nimpact assessment. It was quite dynamic. We 've had only initial discussions with our regulator at this point in \\ntime, naturally ahead of the formal introduction of Basel III final for op risk RWA , there'll be much more \\nextensive interactions with the regulator to agree on the particulars around the ILM, a s you say .  \\nWe made certain modeled assumptions for now , as well as the loss history. We made certain assumptions \\nabout the loss history and the roll off of certain legacy matters. So, it was a thoughtful analysis, a good initial \\nview, but it 's going to be one that requires more work and more engagement with our regulator over the \\ncoming months.  \\nOn the 5%, actually, no, it 's not ex -op risk, it 's incl usive. But given that , op risk we 're saying, as I said in my \\nremarks, we see that as broadly unchanged from now. The maths are the same either way.  \\nAdam Terelak, Mediobanca  \\nPerfect. Thank you very much.  \\nFlora Bocahut, Jefferies  \\nYes. Good morning. I 'd like to talk about the net new money, especially at CS this quarter, because if I look  \\nat extrapolating the quarterly changes in net new money at CS that we 've seen over the past two quarters, it \\nseems to point to a run rate where you gain USD 20 to USD 30 billion of net new money per quarter. But \\nthen, if I try and reconcile just the month of September from what you had disclosed with Q2, it looks like \\nthere 's been a slowdown actually in net new money at CS with just USD 2 billion in Wealth this month.  So \\nwhat should I consider as a more normalized level from here? Is it going to be still the pace we saw over \\nquarterly basis or there is a slowdown because the environment is tougher. You probably have visibility there \\nwith what happened i n October.  \\nAnd the second question is actually following up on this. I know you are going to provide us with the strategic update at the full year, but any hint as to what kind of assumptions you' ve made in your RoCET1 target towards \\n2026 regarding the AUM level, es pecially considering the fact that the market effect is starting for the more \\nnegative now. Thank you.  \\n \\n \\n Page 16 of 22 \\n Todd Tuckner  \\nHi, Flora. Thanks for the question s. So, on the net new money for Credit Suisse Wealth, I appreciate your \\ndoing a fair bit of the extrapola tion math but a long time in this business tells me that extrapolating net new \\nmoney trends is probably not necessarily the way to go, certainly not from you know, a month or so.  \\nThe point we 've made is that we 've stabilized the business. We 're seeing infl ows after massive outflows and \\nthat for us, as Sergio highlighted, was really objective number one , was to stabilize the business and that \\nwe've achieved.  \\nLook, going forward in any case, we 're going to be reporting these metrics on a combined basis. We 're just \\ngiving an indication because we talked about that in the second quarter. We gave an indication even up to \\nthe late publication date towards the end of August. So, we, Sergio and I, wanted to follow through on that \\nand offer that  perspective, but the expectation going forward in any case is that Wealth Management, which \\nis how we manage the business, will be providing a combined net new money plus dividend and interest \\nfigure going forward.  \\nAnd in terms of the RoCET1 assumptions in terms of AUM levels,  we're doing that work now. Naturally, when \\nwe develop the landing zone targets that we articulated in the second quarter, we had a view on growth, but \\nnow we 're validating that in our business planning process and we 'll come back and offer specificity aro und \\nthat in February.  \\nFlora Bocahut  \\nThank you.  \\nJeremy Sigee, Exane BNP Paribas  \\nGood morning. Thank you. I 'd like to ask two questions about non- core, if I could. The first one on the RWA \\noutlook, you' ve had a great start already reducing that balance down quite effectively. The runoff you show \\nin the slide is effectively the natural runoff with no action, but clearly you are taking action. So, is it \\nreasonable for us to expect that rather than being down 50%, it could be down 75% or 100% within that \\nsort of three -year timeframe? It seems that you 're on a more aggressive trajectory than that passive runoff \\nthat you 're showing in the slide.  \\nAnd then, the second question is also about non- core, about the P&L. So you' re annualizing in this quarter \\naround USD 1 billion positive revenues and USD 5 billion of costs. I just wonder is that a representative starting \\npoint for us to sort of model non- core going forward? And linked to that, how much could that change in \\n2024? Could we see – will we still see  positive revenues in 2024 in non- core? And how much could we expect \\nthe costs to reduce in 2024 in non- core?  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nI think, Todd, I mean, let me start with taking the one on – you know we are giving as we mentioned last \\ntime, we just give you a flavor for the natural decay in order for you to understand that , what will be the \\nleftover in case we do nothing. And as you pointed out, we have been pretty active.  \\nHaving said that, I don' t think it' s reasonable to assume that we 're going to take down 100% or 75% to \\n100% per se because it all depends on at what terms we will do it. The very critical topic here is that we have \\n \\n Page 17 of 22 \\n to do it in a way that creates value and not just headlines. So, we can get rid of probably many of those \\npositions, but destroy ing a lot of value. And this will be in conflict with capital accretion and the ability for us \\nto return capital to shareholders.  \\nSo, I think that it 's very clear what is the framework we are using and I think objective number one around non -\\ncore is not ne cessarily just to accelerate the wind down of assets, but it' s to take down cost. That 's the much \\nmore critical element of freeing up capacity and resources.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nAnd Jeremy, on the P&L question, for sure, on the revenue side, I would not annualize the current quarter 's \\nrevenues. The revenues are a function of – the market through which we would exit these positions. It \\ndepends on the nature of the positions we 're talking about. It depends on market conditions. We 'll be \\nopportunistic and ev erything, Sergio just said that actually informs the dynamic about the speed, the timing, \\nthe intensity of when we get out of positions is, of course, what governs in that respect. So, I would put no \\nsort of target or certain extrapolation. Certainly, no e xtrapolation to the current quarter 's revenues in NCL is \\nsaying, well that 's a run rate.  \\nOn the cost side, I would argue that 's different because there you 're looking at – on the underlying OpEx, \\nyou're looking at, at this point, the run rate cost to support the rundown of the business. So, as that business \\nruns down, you would expect that the costs associated, the underlying OpEx supporting the portfolio will also \\nrun down. Now, that may not be linear and I wouldn' t expect it to be linear, but it ought to be somewhere in \\nsome way, shape or form correlated with the size of the balance sheet as it starts to diminish over time.  \\nJeremy Sigee, Exane BNP Paribas  \\nOkay. Thank you.  \\nAndrew Lim, Société Générale  \\nHi. Morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So just turning to tax. Obviously, we saw some nice RWA \\nreduction, but it was negated by the high tax charge. But at the same time, you' re talking about mergers of \\nthe divisional structure to enable you to reduc e the effective tax rate. I was wondering if you could give us \\nmore specificity on when we can expect that to happen. And would that be a gradual process for the \\nreduction in the effective tax rate, or would that be actually a step -down change there?  \\nAnd t hen, my second question is, you' ve done a good job on costs, well done there. The exit run rates for the \\nend of the year, I was wondering if you could update us on that.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nThanks, Andrew. So, on the tax question, in terms of timing. As I mention ed in my remarks, certainly the \\nelevated tax rate is a function of the fact that the expenses that are weighing on our pre -tax at the moment, \\nin particular, the integration related expenses are being incurred in jurisdictions where we 're not able to offset \\n– even within the jurisdictions  - necessarily offset profits and losses in different entities just given where they \\nfall out.  \\nSo there could be expenses or losses in one entity that 's not tax grouped with an entity that is generating \\ntaxable profits. And that' s indeed what 's happening really across the globe because the Credit Suisse entit ies \\n \\n Page 18 of 22 \\n in particular, as you 'll appreciate under Credit Suisse AG, which is not yet merged with UBS AG, those are \\nseparate chains of entities. So, therefore, anything happen ing on the CS AG side that you would otherwise \\nideally shelter with profits of the UBS side, isn 't happening until we start the mergers.  \\nNow, once we do that, your question was, is it a step or it 's gradual? We 'll see both. I mean, certainly we 'll see \\nsome  immediate benefits by bringing together certain entities. Others are going to be harder work and harder \\nplanning to unlock some additional tax value and get the rate to a lower level. So you’ll see once the mergers \\ntake place over the course of 2024, you' ll see some step down. But you' ll also, as I said, gradually see the rate \\ncome back in.  \\nIn terms of the update for year end, we did say that as of the third quarter, we see the run rate saves in excess \\nof USD 3 billion and expect to make further progress. We 're undertaking actions at present. We haven 't \\nquantified that, but you can expect that there will be further progress in the fourth quarter before we exit 2023.  \\nAndrew Lim, Société Générale  \\nThat’s great. Thank you.  \\nAmit Goel, Barclays  \\nHi. Thank you. Two questions from me. So, the first is, I mean, so clearly the legal entity merger is pretty \\nimportant in terms of the kind of the costs and the tax and so forth. So, do you mind just reminding us \\nexactly the main pieces and in terms of the  timing? So, would you be expecting some of that to happen \\nwithin the first half of the year or is that kind of second half? And just things that we can monitor to check \\nthe progress there.  \\nAnd then, secondly, just in terms of the revenue picture, just into Q4, obviously, there 's the commentary on \\nthe transactional income and NII. Just thinking – are you thinking the underlying revenues Q4 ex -NCL are likely \\nto be in line with what we 've seen in Q3 or slightly better or due to seasonality, slightly worse? Th ank you.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nThanks for the questions, Amit. So, on the legal entities, in terms of the main pieces and the timing, obviously, the big groups to address are the parent banks that will take place, the two Swiss banks and then \\nthe US IHCs and the su bsidiaries below. I mean, I 'd say those are – and in the UK as well. And those are going \\nto be the biggest chunks.  \\nOf course,  across the globe, there 's also a lot of undertaking in Europe and in Asia. But the big – I highlighted \\nthe big pieces because that 's what you were looking for. We are working hard on developing plans for all of \\nthose. I think it 's fair to say over the cou rse of 2024, I w on’t at this stage, speculate on exact timing, but we 'll \\nprovide more updates as we go and as we enter the year and as we go through the year, we 'll give you more \\nspecificity around timelines.  \\nIn terms of the revenue picture in the fourth q uarter, I mean, as you mentioned, repeating back that I offered \\nsome NII guidance for our core businesses in terms of underlying NII. We do see the potential for transactional \\nactivities. I mean, the market for transactional activities is a bit clouded at the moment.  \\nWe are seeing some risk off even though, earlier this month certainly some of the less hawkish sentiment, coupled with further rate hike pauses, and seeing bonds and equities rally more recently, that would suggest \\n \\n Page 19 of 22 \\n perhaps more risk on. But I t hink that 's all counterbalanced as well in our clients ' minds also about what 's \\nhappening in the Middle East.  \\nAnd so we do see the potential for TRX in our asset gathering businesses as well as transactional activity in our \\nIB to potentially be affected by  that. And as you mentioned, seasonality will for sure, in any event, be a factor. \\nSo I'd say the revenue picture is a bit clouded, but I, at this point, wouldn' t necessarily expect it to increase \\nquarter -on-quarter significantly at this stage.  \\nAmit Goel, Barclays  \\nGot it. Thanks. And just on the legal entity piece, so just sorry for my understanding, it' s like getting the legal \\nwork done and getting the regulators to kind of sign off. And just in terms of the main things that you, \\nobviously, have to get don e to do the mergers, is that right?  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nYes. That 's correct. There is a lot of planning to be done. The planning manuals are incredibly extensive. And \\nof course, it needs to be approved by the regulators. And when you think about the parent bank and how \\nmany jurisdictions they operate in, you 're talking about regulators across the world. So these are not simple \\ntransactions by any stretch of the imagination.  \\nAmit Goel, Barclays  \\nOkay. Thank you.  \\nBenjamin Goy, Deutsche Bank  \\nHi. Good morning. Two questions, please. The first, if you could maybe speak about the profitability of the \\nrecovery of funds and assets of Credit Suisse and how that 's going, the discussion with clients there. And the \\nsecond is, it looks like, in particul ar, non -core significantly outperformed your expectation you set in Q2 in the \\nthird quarter. So just wondering, what does it mean for the budget, so to say, you have to , for an accelerated \\nrundown in Q4 and beyond. Thank you.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti   \\nYes. I mea n, in terms of the non -core, I don' t think that extrapolating a quarter is meaningful. I do – as Todd \\nmentioned before, we need to look at – in some cases, we were able to dispose assets above marks. In others, \\nwe will need to make an assessment about what  we think is the value of those positions . \\nBut I would pay attention to not to use the third quarter numbers and extrapolate and call it is better than what \\nwe expected because we didn 't really give any guidance on that. So, I mean, I think that we are con fident that \\nthe quality, broadly speaking, of the assets is there. They are non -core assets per se. The vast majority is not \\nproblematic and therefore I 'm not overly concerned about the revenue or the cost to exit. As I mentioned \\nbefore, it' s more of a matter of addressing the cost to sustain those assets than it is about managing out the \\nassets  themselves.  \\nIn terms of recovery of the funds, we see a –  the win -back strategy is still in place. We have been – we are – \\nvery focused. And probably what I can off er as a comment is that as time goes by we saw it already in the \\nsecond quarter of the year after the announcement of the transaction, and definitely, has been confirmed in \\n \\n Page 20 of 22 \\n the third quarter.  Basically, the third quarter is a year after you started to see departure of assets and client \\nadvisor s from Credit Suisse. Despite the massive outflows that you saw, the amount of assets that were able to \\nbe moved by the people that were serving those assets has been within what we expected, on average no more \\nthan 20%. So the first big issue, as I said, we have been able to keep the vast majority of the assets. So it' s very \\ndifficult for people that move out to be able to bring the assets with them.  \\nSo if you look at the numbers, it 's quite – I can give you maybe a li ttle bit of anecdotal evidence. I mean, we \\nlost around – or Credit Suisse in the last 12 months lost around 500 client advisors. They moved so far USD \\n20 billions of assets. So – and let 's say that we we 're going to lose further assets because some of those \\npeople just left more recently, and we 're going to see some outflows later on, but we are totally convinced \\nthat it' s not going to be a multiple of that USD 20 billions, the future outflows. And we are working hard to \\nrecapture some of it.  \\nSo, I think that our strategy now is more focused on regaining the clients that left because of fears of the \\ninstability of the system. And in that sense, we maintain our ambitions, as we say. Most likely, we 're going to \\nformulate these ambitions, as Todd mentio ned, as a combined wealth management business going forward \\nbecause, I mean, it 's not really an issue any longer , Credit Suisse versus UBS , it’s one team. We are working on \\nmaximizing the outcome. And so we 're going to just outline our net new money growth ambitions in our three -\\nyear plan in a way that reflects win -backs and organic growth.  \\nBenjamin Goy, Deutsche Bank  \\nGood. Thank you.  \\nChris Hallam, Goldman Sachs  \\nYeah. Good morning, everyone. Just two from me. So, on profitability, clearly better than expect ed in the \\nquarter. Previously, you 'd guided for positive underlying PBT in H2 and breakeven in the third quarter. So, \\ngiven the third quarter is already quite positive, does that change how we should think about Q4? I guess the \\nold guidance implied a seque ntial improvement in the fourth quarter in terms of PBT. So just wondering \\nwhether that' s still the right way to think about that.  \\nAnd then, second, and I appreciate it 's a bit of a follow -up to some of the earlier questions on CS net new \\nmoney. You' ve giv en the regional disclosure on a combined basis, but I just wanted to check whether the \\ncombined regional picture, sort of Asia strong, EMEA strong, Switzerland more balanced. Is that consistent across both the CS and UBS Wealth franchises?  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nThanks, Christopher. Yeah. On the second question, it is consistent, obviously ex the US given CS doesn' t \\nhave a wealth presence there, but across, it is. I would say the APAC and EMEA proportionality holds \\nobviously on the smaller base that we were talking i n terms of the net inflows this quarter compared to the \\nUBS side. But yes, that dynamic does hold.  \\nIn terms of profitability in the fourth quarter, I would say that we certainly accelerated a bit of what we were forecasting back in August in terms of 3Q, 4 Q where we said roughly breakeven in 3Q and further progress in \\n4Q. I think we 've seen the progress that we 've been able to accelerate. So really undertaking and executing \\nintegration at pace. And you see the results of that.  \\n \\n Page 21 of 22 \\n I'd say 4Q in a way standing a lone relative to how we saw it back in August is still around the same. So I would \\nlook – meaning I would say we expect 4Q to come in better than breakeven, which is what we said was the \\ncase back in August. And I would say balancing the execution on the c ost side, but also considering some of \\nhow we 're guiding on the revenue side I think that number you have an idea of where we, at this stage expect \\nthat number to come in.  \\nChris Hallam, Goldman Sachs  \\nThanks, Todd. Helpful.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nOkay. I think t his was the last question. Let me thank you for dialing in and by just quickly reiterating, as you \\ncan see, we are in full execution mode, but also at the same time we are planning for the future. And the next \\nmilestones , other than the operational one I j ust or we just described , is to prepare the three -year plan that we \\nwill present in February.  \\nIn the meantime, we are very focused really on, as I said, on execution. And I 'm totally convinced that we are \\nin a good place and of course, in our mission to really create some things that will not only be a huge \\nrestructuring story, but also something t hat has set the base for future growth and ambitions that we have. I \\nmean, we look forward to present you the three -year plan in February. And I 'm sure in the meantime, we 're \\ngoing to be in touch either directly or through my colleagues for the follow -ups of this call.  \\nThank you for calling in and enjoy the rest of the day. Thank you.  \\n \\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward -Looking Statements |  This presentation contains statements that constitute “forward -looking statements,” \\nincluding but not limited to management’ s outlook for UBS ’s financial performance, statements relating to the anticipated effect of transactions and \\nstrategic initiatives on UBS ’s business and future development and goals or intentions to achieve climate, sustainability and other social objectives. While \\nthese forward -looking statements represent UBS’ s judgments, expectations and objectives concerning the matters described, a number of risks, uncertainties \\nand other important factors could cause actual developments and resul ts to differ materially from UBS ’s expectations. In particular, recent terrorist activity \\nand escalating armed conflict in the middle east, as well as the continuing Russia –Ukraine war, may have significant impacts on global markets, exacerbate \\nglobal infl ationary pressures, and slow global growth. In addition, the ongoing conflicts may continue to cause significant population displacement, and \\nlead to shortages of vital commodities, including energy shortages and food insecurity outside the areas immediate ly involved in armed conflict. \\nGovernmental responses to the armed conflicts, including, with respect to the Russia -Ukraine war, coordinated successive sets of sanctions on Russia and \\nBelarus, and Russian and Belarusian entities and nationals, and the unce rtainty as to whether the ongoing conflicts will widen and intensify, may continue \\nto have significant adverse effects on the market and macroeconomic conditions, including in ways that cannot be anticipated.  UBS’s acquisition of Credit \\nSuisse has material ly changed our outlook and strategic direction and introduced new operational challenges. The integration of the Credit Suiss e entities \\ninto the UBS structure is expected to take between three and five years and presents significant risks, including the ri sks that UBS Group AG may be unable \\nto achieve the cost reductions and other benefits contemplated by the transaction. This creates significantly greater uncerta inty about forward-looking \\nstatements. Other factors that may affect our performance and abilit y to achieve our plans, outlook and other objectives also include, but are not limited \\nto: (i) the degree to which UBS is successful in the execution of its strategic plans, including its cost reduction and efficiency initiatives and its ability to \\nmanage its levels of risk -weighted assets (RWA) and leverage ratio denominator (LRD), liquidity coverage ratio and other financial resources, including  \\nchanges in RWA assets and liabilities arising from higher market volatility and the size of the combined bank; (ii) the degree to which UBS is successful in \\nimplementing changes to its businesses to meet changing market, regulatory and other conditions, including as a result of the  acquisition of Credit Suisse; \\n(iii) increased inflation and interest rate volatility  in major markets; (iv) developments in the macroeconomic climate and in the markets in which UBS operates \\nor to which it is exposed, including movements in securities prices or liquidity, credit spreads, currency exchange rates, de terioration or slow reco very in \\nresidential and commercial real estate markets, the effects of economic conditions, including increasing inflationary pressur es, market developments, \\nincreasing geopolitical tensions, and changes to national trade policies on the financial position or creditworthiness of UBS ’s clients and counterparties, as \\nwell as on client sentiment and levels of activity, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to manage it, which have had and may also continue to have a significant adverse effect on global and regional economic activity, including disruptions to global supply chains and labor market displacements; (v) changes in the availability of capital and funding, including any adverse changes in UBS ’s credit spreads and credit ratings of UBS,  Credit \\nSuisse, sovereign issuers, structured credit products or credit -related exposures, as well as availability and cost of funding to meet requirements for debt \\neligible for total loss -absorbing capacity (TLAC), in particular in light of the acquisition of Credit Suisse; (vi) changes in central bank policies or the \\nimplementation of financial legislation and regulation in Switzerland, the US, the UK, the European Union and other financial  centers that have imposed, \\nor resulted in, or may do so in the fu ture, more stringent or entity-specific capital, TLAC, leverage ratio, net stable funding ratio, liquidity and funding \\nrequirements, heightened operational resilience requirements, incremental tax requirements, additional levies, limitations on  permitted a ctivities, constraints \\non remuneration, constraints on transfers of capital and liquidity and sharing of operational costs across the Group or other  measures, and the effect these \\nwill or would have on UBS ’s business activities; (vii) UBS’ s ability to succ essfully implement resolvability and related regulatory requirements and the potential \\nneed to make further changes to the legal structure or booking model of UBS in response to legal and regulatory requirements and any additional \\n \\n Page 22 of 22 \\n requirements due to its a cquisition of Credit Suisse, or other developments; (viii) UBS ’s ability to maintain and improve its systems and controls for complying \\nwith sanctions in a timely manner and for the detection and prevention of money laundering to meet evolving regulatory r equirements and expectations, \\nin particular in current geopolitical turmoil; (ix) the uncertainty arising from domestic stresses in certain major economies ; (x) changes in UBS ’s competitive \\nposition, including whether differences in regulatory capital and other requirements among the major financial centers adversely affect UBS ’s ability to \\ncompete in certain lines of business; (xi) changes in the standards of conduct applicable to our businesses that may result f rom new regulations or new \\nenforcement of ex isting standards, including measures to impose new and enhanced duties when interacting with customers and in the execution a nd \\nhandling of customer transactions; (xii) the liability to which UBS may be exposed, or possible constraints or sanctions that  regulatory authorities might \\nimpose on UBS, due to litigation, contractual claims and regulatory investigations, including the potential for disqualification from certain businesses, \\npotentially large fines or monetary penalties, or the loss of licenses or privileges as a result of regulatory or other governmental sanctions, as well as the \\neffect that litigation, regulatory and similar matters have on the operational risk component of our RWA, including as a resu lt of its acquisition of Credit \\nSuisse, as well  as the amount of capital available for return to shareholders; (xiii) the effects on UBS ’s business, in particular cross -border banking, of \\nsanctions, tax or regulatory developments and of possible changes in UBS ’s policies and practices; (xiv) UBS ’s abil ity to retain and attract the employees \\nnecessary to generate revenues and to manage, support and control its businesses, which may be affected by competitive factor s; (xv) changes in accounting \\nor tax standards or policies, and determinations or interpret ations affecting the recognition of gain or loss, the valuation of goodwill, the recognition of \\ndeferred tax assets and other matters; (xvi) UBS ’s ability to implement new technologies and business methods, including digital services and technologies, \\nand ability to successfully compete with both existing and new financial service providers, some of which may not be regulated to  the same extent; (xvii) \\nlimitations on the effectiveness of UBS ’s internal processes for risk management, risk control, measuremen t and modeling, and of financial models generally; \\n(xviii) the occurrence of operational failures, such as fraud, misconduct, unauthorized trading, financial crime, cyberattack s, data leakage and systems \\nfailures, the risk of which is increased with cybera ttack threats from both nation states and non- nation- state actors targeting financial institutions; (xix) \\nrestrictions on the ability of UBS Group AG to make payments or distributions, including due to restrictions on the ability o f its subsidiaries to make loans \\nor distributions, directly or indirectly, or, in the case of financial difficulties, due to the exercise by FINMA or the regulators of UBS ’s operations in other \\ncountries of their broad statutory powers in relation to protective measures, restructu ring and liquidation proceedings;

For us, these  past \\neight weeks were intense as we were busy writing the next chapter in UBS’s history.  This is the first -ever \\nacquisition involving two global system ically important banks.  It was announced only five months ago and we \\nclosed it less than 100 days ago.  This would not have been possible without extraordinary effort and dedication \\nfrom my colleagues across both organizations. It also required extensive c ooperation from the Swiss \\ngovernment and regulators in Switzerland and around the world.  \\nWe are swiftly executing on our integration plans, already achieving a number of important milestones. We \\nestablished a target operating model, created a dedicated int egration office, and rolled out responsibilities with \\nmanagement appointments up to three levels below the Group Executive Board , just to name a few.  We are \\nalso making progress on our cost -saving and de -risking plans and resolving some legacy matt ers for both firms.   \\nFollowing a detailed analysis, we terminated and handed back all Swiss government support a few weeks ago. \\nLastly, we decided to fully integrate the Swiss business of Credit Suisse after a thorough strategic review.  \\nThe thing I am pro udest about is that clients have rewarded our unwavering commitment with extended trust.  \\nThanks to their restored belief in the combined firm we were able to swiftly stabilize the Credit Suisse core – its \\nwealth, asset management, and Swiss Bank franchise s.  We are happy to see markets recognizing our ongoing \\nwork.  \\nSlide 4 – Enhancing client franchises and increasing scale  \\nOur strategy is unchanged , and the Credit Suisse acquisition will act as an accelerant to our plans. We will \\nstrengthen our position a s the only truly global wealth manager, and as the leading Swiss universal bank, with \\nscaled -up asset management and a focused investment bank.   \\nWith a highly complementary footprint, we will reinforce our position in key growth markets, including the \\nAmericas and APAC, and build on our leadership in Switzerland and EMEA.  We will relentlessly focus on clients \\n \\n Page 2 of 27 \\n and continuously improve and expand our services and products. With 5.5 trillion dollars in assets across the \\ncombined firm, the transaction adds s cale that will lead to increased efficiencies. This will allow us to better \\nfocus our resources, and target investments that provide superior levels of client service.  \\nSlide 5 – Improving our business mix, with unchanged capital allocation discipline  \\nWe will achieve our strategy while remaining disciplined in our resource management across the entire firm.  \\nThe IB consuming no more than 25% of the Group’s risk-weighted assets and the rundown of the Non -core \\nand Legacy portfolio are just two of the more visible examples of our approach.  In essence, we will repeat what \\nthis bank successfully accomplished during the last decade.  \\nSlide 6 – Update on integration – divider  \\n Before I discuss the Swiss Bank decision, let me give you a brief overview of our assessment of Credit Suisse as \\nof March 19.  Since then, and especially after we closed the acquisition in June, we conducted an in -depth \\nanalysis that has only confirmed the necessity of the decisive actions taken over that weekend.   \\nIt was not just a matter of liquidity drying up.  Credit Suisse’s business model and business mix was deeply \\nflawed and its reputation severely damaged. With its structural lack of underlying profitability, unsustainable \\ncapital allocation, and negative revenu e and costs prospects, the bank was no longer in a position to continue \\non its own. This is clearly visible from the year -to-date losses Credit Suisse reported today, a culmination of the \\nbank’s two loss -making years.   \\nThanks to our financial and balance sheet strength, UBS was in a position to answer a rescue call from the Swiss \\ngovernment, helping to stabilize the financial system.  Importantly, the transaction preserves the best of Credit \\nSuisse’s excellent client relationships, people, and industry -leading products that in other plausible scenarios \\nwould have been weakened or lost.  Unlocking Credit Suisse’s strengths as part of UBS, will allow us to build \\nsomething of a more enduring value for all stakeholders.  This combination will reinforce our stat us as a premier \\nglobal franchise – one that our home market, Switzerland, can be proud of.  We are humbled by this task, and \\nthe responsibility entrusted to us.   \\nBut let me make one thing absolutely clear: Our ability to stabilize Credit Suisse, and retur n the government \\nguarantees in timely fashion, should not take away from the gravity of the situation we inherited. Nor should \\nit diminish the scope and scale of the task ahead.  \\nSlide 7 – Diligent approach to identify and asses strategic options for Credit  Suisse (Schweiz)  \\nThat being said, let me walk you through how we came  to our decision on the future of Credit Suisse (Schweiz ).  \\nAs I promised when I returned as CEO a few months ago, the decision would be driven by facts, not emotions, \\nand mindful of the extraordinary circumstances of the transaction.  \\nWe conducted an extremely thorough review involving teams comprised of some of  the best people across \\nboth firms, with support from external experts where needed. Our analysis focused on four key aspects that, \\nfor us, would determine the long -term viability of the business. We examined what the decision would entail \\nfor our clients , shareholders, and employees. And we gave special consideration to financial and funding \\nsustainability.  We started with a broad spectrum of possibilities, ranging from IPO, sale, partial or full integration \\nto a spinoff, and even a dual -brand strategy.  Eventually, based on our criteria, we narrowed down our selection \\n \\n Page 3 of 27 \\n to the two best options: a full integration or a spin -off of a focused perimeter, which would exclude segments \\nrequiring global capabilities.   \\nThe final outcome was crystal clear: Full inte gration is by far the best choice.  \\nSlide 8 – Integration of Credit Suisse (Schweiz) is the best path forward  \\nIt is not just that the financial merits of integration are greater.  It is also the best way forward for our clients, \\nfor whom the industry -leading offering will improve and broaden as we combine products and capabilities from \\nboth firms. The alternative would have been a bleak one, considering the current situation, combined with the \\nnecessity to carve out most of its global capabilities. Even a m ore focused spin -off of Credit Suisse Schweiz \\nwould fail to meet the needs of many of its corporate clients, as well as the entrepreneurs it considers core.  \\nAt the same time, separation from the Group would entail a costly, risky and lengthy carveout of te chnology \\nplatforms, causing uncertainty for clients and employees for years to come.  Moreover, our analysis revealed a \\nsubstantial dependency of the Swiss subsidiary on financial resources and operational support from the parent.  \\nAs a result, it would hav e existed as a fragile entity struggling to close its funding gap, unable to compete \\neffectively and failing to deliver sustainable returns.  We believe this would not have been an acceptable \\nproposition for clients, employees – and very likely - regulator s.   \\nBy contrast, being a part of UBS ensures it will have continuous backing from one of the most stable and trusted \\nglobal financial institutions. The strength of UBS will underpin the franchise and provide access to efficient \\nfunding, as demonstrated by  our ability to return all extraordinary government and central bank facilities.  \\nWe take our social responsibilities very seriously. This is why I have repeatedly emphasized the fact that \\nemployment -related considerations must be a key decision -making fac tor in our evaluation.  We have analyzed \\ntheir impact in both absolute terms and in relation to the Swiss job market.  Every lost job is painful for us.  \\nUnfortunately, in this situation, cuts were unavoidable, regardless of the selected scenario.  We are committed \\nto minimizing the impact on employees by treating them fairly, providing them with financial support, \\noutplacement services, and retraining opportunities.  Our aim here is to enable those affected to take advantage \\nof a quite -healthy Swiss job ma rket, where more open positions in finance are available than there are job \\nseekers.  \\nLet me emphasize: the vast majority of job reductions will come from natural attrition, retirements and internal \\nmobility. Around 1,000 redundancies will result from the integration of Credit Suisse Schweiz.  These will be \\nspread over a couple of years, starting in late 2024.  Importantly , in the alternative spin -off scenario, \\nrestructuring would also have been necessary, and resulted in about 600 redundancies. In addition, the \\nnecessity to profoundly restructure other parts of Credit Suisse is expected to lead to  about 2,000 additional \\nredundancies in Switzerland over the next couple of years.  \\nAfter weighing  all of the above factors, we came to the view that a full integration is the best way forward.  \\nSlide 9 – Unwavering commitment to our clients, emplo yees and the Swiss economy  \\nOur decision reinforces our commitment to clients, employees, and the Swiss economy.   \\nOur goal is to make the  transition for clients as smooth as possible.  The two Swiss ringfenced entities will \\noperate separat ely until their planned legal integration in 2024.  Credit Suisse brand and operations will remain \\nseparate during that time.  We will gradually migrate clients onto our systems and expect to finish this process \\n \\n Page 4 of 27 \\n in 2025.  Given this, nothing will change for  clients in the foreseeable future and they do not have to take any \\nimmediate action.  We will continue to provide the premier levels of service that they have come to expect. And \\nwith time they will begin to see the further benefits of the combined fr anchise.  \\nAs we progress in the integration, we remain fully committed to our personal, private, institutional and \\ncorporate clients. In terms of lending, thanks to our even -stronger capital base, our intention is to keep the \\ncombined exposure unchanged  while maintaining our risk discipline.  We are sensitive to the important role \\nboth firms play in the lives of our employees and their communities.  We want to remain an employer of choice \\nin Switzerland, offering attractive career opportunities.  Last but no t least, as we combine, we will honor all \\nagreed sponsorships of civic, sporting and cultural activities in Switzerland at least until the end of 2025.  \\nI have made it abundantly clear to our colleagues that they must not be distracted by the integration.  We \\ncannot take our eyes off our vision and must remain focused on client needs.  After all, competition in the Swiss \\nmarket remains robust.  The cantonal banks in aggregate will continue to have the highest market shares in all \\nrelevant personal and commer cial banking products. And our branch network, even after the merger, is the \\nthird-biggest.  We welcome the challenge. Competition is what makes all of us better, and what makes the \\nSwiss financial system stronger.  \\nSlide 10 – Stabilized flows and focusing on client win -back opportunity  \\nGiven  the events leading up to the acquisition, stabilizing the Credit Suisse client franchises globally has been \\nour most immediate priority.  Since closing in June, we have won back clients’ confidence, as evidenced by \\npositive asset flows and strong enga gement across Wealth Management and the Swiss business.   \\nWe saw formidable momentum in deposits, with 23 billion dollars in inflows for the quarter, 18 billion of which \\ncame  into Credit Suisse’s Wealth Management and Swiss Bank.  Meanwhile, UBS wealth management has \\ndelivered the highest second -quarter net new money performance in over a decade.  \\nWe are pleased to share that this positive trend has carried on into July and Au gust.  While the quarter is not \\nover yet, so far we have attracted net new assets of 8 billion  for the combined wealth management businesses.  \\nIt is encouraging and rewarding to see the franchise stabilize so quickly.  Winning back the more than 200  \\nbillion dollars of client assets that left Credit Suisse over the past year won’t be easy, but recapturing as much \\nas we can is one of our top priorities.  \\nSlide 11 – Non-strategic assets and businesses to be exited through Non -Core and Legacy  \\nLet’s move  to assets that  we have designated as non -core. First, let me briefly touch on the 9 billion RWAs that \\nwill be included in the combined Investment Bank.  \\nThese assets were selected through a disciplined process designed to enhance our Global Banking and \\nderivatives operations.  The transferred businesses are expected to be accretive from next year. They will help \\ndrive economies of scale while adding only 13% to the investment bank’s current non op -risk RWAs.   \\nThe remaining 17 billion of  Credit Suisse’s investment bank, as you can see from the chart, will be transferred \\nto the newly -formed Non -core and Legacy unit.  This will also include Credit Suisse’s entire Capital Release Unit \\n \\n Page 5 of 27 \\n as well as selected assets from the combined wealth and a sset management businesses that are not aligned \\nwith our risk appetite or strategy.   \\nOverall, the NCL will comprise of 224 billion in LRD, with a significant portion in high-quality and liquid assets, \\nand 55 billion in risk weighted assets  excluding op -risk RWAs.  \\nWith the perimeter largely defined, we are already executing on our strategy to exit these assets in a timely and \\nefficient manner.  We made a good start in the second quarter, reducing positions representing a total of 9 \\nbillion in RWA.  Around half of those came from sales that we actively pursued.  \\nSlide 12 – Non-core and legacy rundown to drive lower costs and efficient capital release  \\nAs I mentioned before, this is not the first time our organization has manag ed a successful run -down of non -\\ncore assets.  Our previous experience is a big part of why we are confident in our ultimate success.   \\nA clear priority for us is to take out a substantial part of the operating costs associated with this unit.  I will \\ntouch  on that in a minute.  \\nThanks to our strong capital position, and markdowns we took as part of the PPA adjustments, we have \\nsubstantial flexibility in order to optimize the outcome.  These are not distressed assets, so we can maintain \\npositions if they pre serve value.  Our decisions whether to do so will be based on economic profitability, taking \\ninto account funding, operating and capital costs of the portfolios.  On those positions we do decide to exit, \\nwe will move at pace, acting fairly and protecting our clients and counterparties.  \\nThe natural run -off profile is a steep one.  As you can see from the chart, we will have a 50%, or 27 billion, \\nreduction in non op -risk RWAs by 2026 and a similar reduction in LRD.  But let me assure you that our proactive \\napproach to accelerate the wind -down will continue.  \\nSlide 13 – Executing on plans to achieve greater than 10bn gross cost reductions by year -end 2026  \\nNow let’s turn to cost reductions, a key element of returning to profitability and creating sustainable value \\nacross the combined firm.  First, as we speak, we are actively addressing the need for deep restructuring at \\nCredit Suisse.  This is an acceleration and expansion of the work that the firm itself saw as necessary to put a \\nstop to losing mo ney. Secondly, additional efforts are required to generate synergies across the combined \\nbusinesses.   \\nWe aim to take out over 10 billion dollars in gross expenses from the combined franchise, based on full -year \\n2022 cost base.  Around half of that will c ome from restructuring the investment bank and running down non -\\ncore assets.  The other half will come from actions across the rest of our operations.  There is meaningful \\n \\n Page 6 of 27 \\n duplication that can be removed, thousands of applications and IT platforms to be d ecommissioned, and \\nhundreds of legal entities to be merged or closed to make us more efficient and effective.  \\nLet me give you an example.  Of Credit Suisse’s current 3,000+ IT applications only around 300 will be integrated \\ninto UBS infrastructure, contrib uting to our combined future business model.  \\nImportantly, we will continue investing to make our platforms and processes more resilient and support our \\nexisting, and future, growth ambitions.  We will also absorb some further inflation.  All told, we aim t o bring \\nthe Group’s underlying cost/income ratio exit rate below 70% in 2026.  \\nSlide 14 – We aim to substantially complete integration for the Group by year -end 2026  \\nWe are two and a half months into one of the biggest and most complex bank mergers in hist ory.  We are \\nexecuting our plans at pace and wasting no time in delivering value for our all our stakeholders, including \\nshareholders.  \\nIn the next four to six months our focus will be on restoring underlying profitability, while progressing on other \\nareas, including business transformation, client migration and simplification of our combined legal entity \\nstructure.   \\nOn the latter, a key milestone will be the merger of our parent operating entities UBS AG and Credit Suisse  AG.  \\nThis step, planned for 2024, will allow us to simplify our structure and operating model, optimize capital and \\nliquidity within the Group , and  will support ac hieving our cost -savings ambitions.  \\nWe expect to substantially complete our integration program by 2026.    \\nSlide 15 – Working towards ~15% RoCET1  \\nA key pillar of our strategy is to maintain a balance sheet for all seasons - one that supports our capital -\\ngenerative business and allows us to offer attractive capital returns.  We expect to operate at around 14% CET1 \\ncapital ratio over the medium term. And as we exit 2026, we aim to achieve an underlying return on CET1 of \\naround 15%.  \\nAs you know, we have sus pended share repurchases for the time being. But we remain committed to growing \\nour dividend and returning excess capital to shareholders through buybacks.  We will update you on our plans \\nin this regard with the fourth -quarter results.  \\nWith that, let me hand over to Todd.   \\n \\n Page 7 of 27 \\n Todd Tuckner  \\n \\nSlide 17 – UBS Group 2Q23 results  \\nThank you, Sergio.  Good morning everyone – it is a privilege to be with you today as Group CFO, especially \\nat this watershed moment for UBS.  \\nSince my appointment, my focus has been on the financial consolidation of the two firms, progressing the \\nwork done on transaction adjustments, optimizing our liquidity and funding position, firming up our cost \\nsavings and enhancing financial reporting controls for the expanded group.  \\nRegardless of whether staff come from Credit Suisse or UBS, I’ve been extremely impressed with the \\ndedication of the finance team.  I’m proud of what we as a unit have already been able to accomplish, and \\nwe, like the entire firm, continue to execute at pace.  \\nWe recogni ze that this is a complex deal, but our aim is to be clear and forthcoming in explaining the \\nfinancial implications of our actions during this critical period and beyond.  \\nToday, I’ll cover our second quarter operating performance, the impact of the merger on our balance sheet \\nand capital as of day 1 and, finally, our integration plan and outlook.  \\nLet’s start with the quarter on slide 17.  I’ll refer to UBS Group AG’s consolidated results, which this quarter \\ninclude one month of Credit Suisse’s operating per formance, presented under IFRS and in US dollars.  \\nOn a reported basis, the second quarter profit was 29 billion, both pre - and post -tax.  These results were \\nlargely driven by the net impact from items related to the acquisition, principally negative goodwi ll of \\n28.9 billion and integration -related expenses and acquisition costs.  Excluding these items, the Group pre -tax \\nprofit was 1.1 billion, of which 2.0 billion from the UBS sub -group, and negative 0.8 billion from the Credit \\nSuisse sub -group.   \\nSlide 18 – Negative goodwill and overview of purchase price allocation adjustments  \\nTurning to slide 18.  The negative goodwill of 28.9 billion is calculated as the difference between the \\nconsideration UBS paid and the fair value of the acquired net assets after taking into account the various PPA \\nadjustments of  negative 25 billion.   \\nThe roughly 6 billion difference between the negative goodwill reported today and the amount included in \\nthe Form F4 registration statement just prior to closing is principal ly explained by two factors. First, Credit \\nSuisse generated operating losses over the first 5 months of 2023 that were not captured in the F4, which \\nwas prepared as if the transaction occurred on December 31, 2022. Second, we applied additional net \\nnegati ve PPA adjustments to Credit Suisse’s financial assets and liabilities, reflecting a more detailed fair value \\nassessment post -closing.  \\nThe total net PPA adjustments of negative 25 billion consist primarily of marks of negative 14.7 billion in \\nconnection w ith financial assets and liabilities.  This includes negative 12.4 billion on mainly fixed -rate accrual \\nassets and liabilities, of which around 8 and half billion relates to our core businesses and around 4 billion to \\nNon-core and Legacy.  In addition, we made negative 2.3 billion of further necessary adjustments to fair value \\npositions, mostly related to Non-core and Legacy . \\n \\n Page 8 of 27 \\n The negative 8 and a half billion of marks on core -business accrual financial instruments include, for example, \\nPPA adjustm ents on the Swiss mortgage book, which were almost entirely interest rate driven.   \\nThe majority of the accrual -basis positions are expected to mature within the next 3 to 4 years and, if held to \\nmaturity, will pull to par.  \\nOf the total marks on accrual po sitions, 6 billion pre -tax, or 5 billion net of tax, are CET1 capital -neutral as \\nFINMA has granted us transitional relief, which mainly applies to Swiss mortgages.  The transitional treatment \\nis subject to linear amortization concluding by June 30, 2027.  \\nThe negative marks of 2.3 billion on fair value assets and liabilities that I mentioned earlier reflect UBS’s \\nassessment of the complexity, liquidity and model risk uncertainties in the book, as well as the relevant \\nmarkets for potential strategic exits.  \\nWe also made PPA adjustments of negative 4.5 billion to capture UBS’s determination of Credit Suisse’s \\nprovisions and contingent liabilities related to litigation, regulatory and similar matters. This includes 1. 5 \\nbillion  of incremental provisions Credi t Suisse took in the second quarter.  \\nOther net PPA adjustments, totaling to negative 5 and a half billion, largely relate to GAAP differences \\nassociated with pension accounting, but also goodwill and intangibles, and fair value marks on non -financial \\nasset s and liabilities, including software and real estate.  \\nOf the total negative 25 billion of PPA adjustments, negative 17 billion is CET1 capital -relevant, with the \\nbalance relating to the 5 billion regulatory waiver I mentioned earlier, and other items that  are filtered out of \\nCET1 capital, such as pension accounting differences, goodwill and intangibles.  \\nOverall, we believe the negative goodwill, including the PPA adjustments therein – in addition to \\nunderpinning almost 240 billion of acquired RWA - provide s us with sufficient capacity to absorb the costs to \\nachieve our two key saving objectives: first, an efficient wind -down of the non -core businesses and associated \\noverhead we acquired, and second, positive operating leverage and synergies in our core fran chises.  All while \\nremaining capital -generative over the integration timeline.   \\nSlide 19 – The acquisition strengthens the foundation of the combined bank  \\nWe are highly confident that we can successfully integrate Credit Suisse, enhancing our business mod el and \\noperating metrics, while continuing to ensure we maintain world class capital ratios and a balance sheet for \\nall seasons.  \\nOn page 19, we illustrate how the transaction strengthens key financial measures from day 1, offering us a \\nhighly attractive s tarting point as we commence this journey. Since the acquisition, our capital position is even \\nstronger with almost 200 billion total loss absorbing capacity, and a CET1 capital ratio of 14.4%.  \\nAdditionally, our tangible book value per share is up 49% qua rter on quarter and, today, we manage over 5 \\nand a half trillion dollars of invested assets with a unique and meaningful presence in all the major markets \\nacross the globe.   \\nSlide 20 – Our balance sheet for all seasons remains the foundation of our succes s \\nRemaining on capital on slide 20.  The strength of our balance sheet is the foundation of our success and the \\nreason why we were able to restore financial stability and client trust in such a short amount of time.  \\n \\n Page 9 of 27 \\n As of the end of June, as just mentioned , our CET1 capital ratio was 14.4% and our CET1 leverage ratio was \\n4.8%.  \\nIncluded in our capital ratio this quarter are the impacts from the closing of the Credit Suisse acquisition, \\nincluding a 10 billion operational risk RWA reduction from diversificati on benefits  and a combined lower \\nforward -looking risk profile . \\nLooking through to the end of the year, we expect our CET1 capital ratio to remain around 14%, as the \\nbenefit of RWA reductions, improvements in our underlying profitability, mainly from cost s aves, and CET1 \\ncapital -relevant pull -to-par effects from the PPA adjustments are expected to largely, but not fully, offset \\nintegration -related expenses.  \\nWe also expect to maintain a CET1 capital ratio of around 14% and a CET1 leverage ratio or more than 4% \\nover the medium -term.  \\nYou have often heard us referring to our balance sheet for all seasons and our capital -generative operating \\nmodel that allows us to service clients and invest in the business through the cycle.  It’s how we’ve operated \\nover the las t decade, and it’s how we intend to continue to operate going forward.  So rest assured, \\nmaintaining a balance sheet for all seasons will remain among our very top priorities.   \\nSlide 21 – Prudent management of liquidity and funding  \\nOn liquidity and funding on slide 21, we closed the quarter with an average liquidity coverage ratio of 175%, \\nwell above our prior quarter level, and a net stable funding ratio of 118%.  The liquidity coverage ratio \\nincrease largely reflects the elevated HQLA levels at Cre dit Suisse, including the effect of the usage of the \\nSwiss National Bank facilities.  \\nAs Sergio highlighted, positive net new deposits in the past few months enabled us to repay ELA+ and \\nterminate the Public Liquidity Backstop facility, as announced earlier  this month.  We expect to continue \\nattracting net new deposits, and as of this week we’ve already seen, in the third quarter, 13 billion of positive \\nnet new deposit flows in our combined wealth management and Swiss franchises.  While this will help us \\nnarrow the inherited funding gap and continue to manage our liquidity coverage ratio at prudent levels, we \\nexpect to resume execution of our funding plans shortly.  \\nIn addition to maintaining significant liquidity and funding buffers on a consolidated basis, w e’re actively \\nmanaging the allocation of financial resources among our significant legal entities, which also have \\nstandalone funding requirements and will continue to operate while we progress towards our target legal \\nentity structure.   \\nWe’re working tow ards merging Credit Suisse AG into UBS AG in 2024, as this is a critical step to removing \\nresource allocation bottlenecks and enabling the realization of business and operational efficiencies.   \\nSlide 22 – 2Q23 UBS business divisions and Group Functions (I FRS) – excl. Credit Suisse  \\nNow onto slide 22.  Excluding Credit Suisse’s performance in June, the effects  of the acquisition I mentioned \\nearlier, and a gain on sale of 848 million in Asset Management last year, UBS’s pre -tax profit in the quarter \\nwas 2.0 billion, up 12% year -over-year.  \\n \\n \\n Page 10 of 27 \\n Slide 23 – Global Wealth Management  \\nBefore turning to the UBS sub -group business divisions starting on page 23, let me first point out that for the \\nsecond quarter, the negative goodwill as well as a substantial portion  of integration -related expenses have \\nbeen retained and reported in Group Functions.  Starting with the third quarter, we intend to consolidate the \\nreporting of our business divisions across the UBS and Credit Suisse sub -groups, and we’ll report integratio n-\\nrelated expenses in the respective combined segments.   \\nAll references to figures are in US dollars and comparisons are year -over-year, unless stated otherwise.  \\nIn Global Wealth Management, we delivered net new money of 16 billion, the strongest second q uarter in \\nover a decade, with inflows across Switzerland, EMEA and APAC, and despite 5 billion in seasonal tax \\npayments in the US.   \\nWe also delivered net new fee generating assets of 13 billion, or an annualized growth rate of 4% with \\npositive flows acros s all regions, as well as net new deposits of 5 billion.  \\nThese strong inflows across net new money, fee -generating assets and deposits demonstrate our continuous \\nfocus on active client engagement and the trust our clients place in us.  This was especially important during a \\nquarter where the macro backdrop and developments with Credit Suisse placed a premium on our investment \\nadvice and the stability of our GWM franchise.  \\nProfit before tax was 1.1 billion, down 4% despite strong growth in EMEA and Switzerla nd of 15% and 9%, \\nrespectively.  Positive top -line contributions from all regions outside of Americas supported a 1% revenue \\nincrease, which was more than offset by higher expenses.  \\nIn the Americas, revenues were down 4% mainly as net interest income reflected continued rotation into \\nhigher yielding deposits and investments from transactional and sweep deposit accounts.  Although we \\nexpect NII in the Americas to continue to tick -down sequentially from ongoing cash sorting and deleveraging \\nin the current rates environment, we nevertheless continue to see the US market as a strategic priority for us, \\nand hence we continue to invest in the business for future growth.  As a result, we expe ct our pre -tax margin \\nin the Americas to be low double -digit to mid -teens over the near -term.  \\nOnto total GWM revenues.  Net interest income was up 14% year -over-year, and down 3% sequentially, the \\nlatter reflecting mix shifts and lower deposit and loan ba lances, partly offset by higher deposit margins.   \\nRecurring net fee income decreased 3% due to negative market performance while positive inflows were \\noffset by clients’ continued repositioning into lower margin solutions.  As a reminder, we bill based on  daily \\nbalances in the Americas and on month -end balances everywhere else.  As such, second quarter revenues did \\nnot fully reflect June’s market rally, which we’re seeing benefit the third quarter.  \\nTransaction -based income decreased 6%, impacted by invest or uncertainty, particularly in Americas and \\nAPAC.  However, towards the end of the second quarter and into the third, we’re seeing a pick -up in both \\nclient sentiment and transactional momentum especially in APAC.  \\nOperating expenses ex -litigation, integrat ion-related expenses and FX were up 3% driven by increases in \\ntechnology and personnel expenses.   \\nSlide 24 – Personal & Corporate Banking (CHF)  \\n \\n Page 11 of 27 \\n Turning to Personal & Corporate Banking on slide 24.  We delivered another record quarter excluding past \\none-off gains.  Profit before tax was up 54% to 612 million Swiss francs.  Revenues increased 24%, with \\nincreases across all revenue lines, highlighting continued momentum in the business.  Net interest income \\nincreased by 45% year on year and 12% quarter -on-quarter.  Sequentially, we continued to see loan growth, \\nwhile the deposit base remained roughly stable.  Costs were up 9%, driven by continued tech investments and \\nhigher personnel expenses.  The cost -to-income ratio was 51%, a 7 percentage -point improvement year -on-\\nyear, demonstrating strong positive operating leverage.  \\nWe saw strong momentum with 10% annualized growth in net new investment products and almost \\n6 thousand net new clients, reflecting the trust our clients continue to place in us .  \\nSlide 25 – Asset Management  \\nMoving to slide 25.  In Asset Management the profit before tax was 90 million.  \\nExcluding last year’s gain on sale, total revenues decreased 5%, with lower net management fees, driven by \\nmarket headwinds, asset mix, as well as  lower performance fees.  These headwinds were partially offset by \\n1% lower costs.  \\nNet new money in the quarter was strong at 17 billion, a 6% annualized growth rate.  Net new money \\nexcluding money markets and associates was 19.5 billion, with positive mom entum in SMAs and alternatives.   \\nSlide 26 – Investment Bank  \\nTurning to slide 26.  In the Investment Bank the profit before tax was 139 million.  \\nThe operating environment for the Investment Bank’s trading businesses was defined by significantly lower \\nequity  volatility levels compared to the prior -year period.  \\nWithin Global Markets, this resulted in a meaningful decline in client activity levels across both Equities and \\nFRC, where revenues of 1.5 billion were down 11%, broadly consistent with our peer group.    \\nOur Financing business continued to deliver strong results, reporting its best second -quarter and best first -half \\non record. This demonstrates the resilience of our balanced portfolio of risk -efficient businesses, as we \\ncontinue to invest in capabilitie s that are critical to our clients.  \\nGlobal Banking revenues of 371 million were down 2% as the second quarter saw the global fee pool hit its \\nlowest quarterly level since 2012.  In the second quarter we significantly outperformed the fee pool in EMEA \\nand g ained share in global M&A.  \\nOperating expenses were up 2%, predominantly on higher tech investments offsetting lower provisions for \\nlitigation, regulatory and similar matters.   \\nSlide 27 – 2Q23 Credit Suisse AG reported loss of (8.9bn), (4.3bn) excluding ac quisition related effects; \\n(2.1bn) adjusted loss (CHF, US GAAP)  \\nOn slide 27, I now turn to Credit Suisse AG’s full second quarter results, which were separately published \\nearlier today.  Credit Suisse AG’s reported pre -tax loss for the second quarter was 8 .9 billion Swiss francs.  \\nThis result includes several large items, including 2.2 billion in adjustments to fair value marks, 1.8 billion in \\n \\n Page 12 of 27 \\n software write -downs, 1.3 billion in additional litigation provisions, and 1.0 billion for a goodwill impairment.  \\nStripping out these and other items that are not representative of Credit Suisse AG’s underlying performance \\nin the quarter, the adjusted operating loss was 2.1 billion Swiss francs.   \\nNot included in this figure are the results of a few legal entities tha t fall outside of Credit Suisse AG’s \\nconsolidation scope.  Including those entities, the Credit Suisse sub -group’s pro -forma second quarter \\nadjusted operating loss was 2.0 billion Swiss francs.  In discussing the Credit Suisse sub -group performance in \\nthe second quarter, I’ll focus on this 2 -billion Swiss franc adjusted loss as it better informs the starting point \\nfor the group in combination with UBS’s quarterly underlying performance.    \\nSlide 28 – Credit Suisse adjusted 2Q23 results (CHF, US GAAP)  \\nOn slid e 28, Credit Suisse’s quarterly adjusted pre -tax loss was largely driven by operating losses in the Credit \\nSuisse  Investment Bank and the Capital Release Unit, as well as elevated funding costs in the  Credit Suisse  \\nCorporate Center.  \\nSequentially, revenues declined by 38%, driven by Credit Suisse’s Investment Bank, down 78%, where the \\nsharp drop in revenues was due to little -to-no new activity in the context of expected exits following the \\nacquisition.  Second quarte r revenues also reflected elevated funding costs, primarily from the Swiss National \\nBank facilities.  \\nGoing forward, we’ll focus on two key priorities in relation to Credit Suisse’s Investment Bank and Capital \\nRelease Unit.  First, rebuild activity and profitability levels of the businesses we decided to retain as part of our \\ncore Investment Bank.  And se cond, actively manage the wind -down of businesses and positions that are not \\naligned to our strategy.  These include those already in the Credit Suisse Capital Release Unit and Investment \\nBank not retained as core, and will be managed and reported within o ur Non -Core and Legacy segment \\nbeginning in the third quarter.  \\nMoreover, as the wind down is executed, we’ll decisively take out all costs in relation to resources, technology \\nand real estate that are not needed to support either what is retained in our co re Investment Bank or what is \\nstrictly required to efficiently wind -down businesses and positions managed by our Non -core and Legacy \\nteam.  \\nIn contrast to Credit Suisse’s Investment Bank and Capital Release Unit, we saw relative stability across Credit \\nSuisse’s Wealth Management, Swiss Bank and Asset Management segments.   \\nIn Credit Suisse Wealth Management, we’ve seen a stabilization of net new assets, trending from substantial \\noutflows in April to net inflows in June, with 14 billion dollars of net new  deposits in the quarter.  We remain \\nfocused on introducing Credit Suisse’s clients to the unrivaled value proposition of the combined firm to \\ncounterbalance any headwinds to our flows from lag effects stemming from past or future attrition of Credit \\nSuisse relationship managers.  In addition to clear and decisive actions to retain client assets, we also \\nimplemented client advisor incentive programs with the clear objective to “win back” and sustainably retain \\nclient assets.  Quarter to date, these actions have helped us to attract net new deposits of 10 billion dollars \\nand positive net new assets in the Credit Suisse wealth management franchise.  \\nCredit Suisse’s adjusted operating expenses were down 10% sequentially, reflecting actions initiated before \\nand after the merger announcement, as well as voluntary attrition of employees.  As of the end of the second \\nquarter, headcount was down by over 8,000 compared to the end of 2022, split roughly equally between \\ninternal and external staff.   \\n \\n Page 13 of 27 \\n Slide 29 – Driving positive underlying profitability and maintaining ~14% CET1 capital ratio  \\nI now turn to slide 29.  On an illustrative and underlying basis, the sum of the UBS sub -group pre -tax profit of \\n2.0 billion, and the Credit Suisse sub -group pre -tax loss of 2.2 bill ion, after translation to US dollars, equals a \\ncombined pro forma Group operating loss of around negative 0.3 billion.  You can consider this indicative \\nlevel as a useful starting point to contextualize the trajectory of our underlying profitability going forward, \\nand assess the steps we are taking to achieve our ambitions.  \\nFirst and foremost, we’re executing on our cost reduction plans at pace and we expect positive combined \\nunderlying profits in the second half of 2023.  We expect to deliver underlying e xit rate cost savings of over 3 \\nbillion by the end of the year - which will benefit our 2024 results - and to incur a broadly similar amount of \\nintegration -related expenses in 2H23.  While neutral to our underlying performance, I would note that such \\ninteg ration -related expenses will be partly offset by pull -to-par effects of over 1 and a half billion.  \\nSecond, asset and deposit retention and win -back initiatives will continue to support the positive momentum \\nacross our wealth management businesses.  In particular we expect to see positive underlying contribution \\nfrom the Credit Suisse wealth management franchise by the first half of 2024.  We will apply this same \\nsystematic approach to client and asset retention and win -back across all of  our core franchises, especially \\nfollowing today’s announcement in connection with the Swiss business es. \\nThird, our second quarter 2023 pro forma results include 550 million of funding costs related to the Swiss \\nNational Bank facilities that Credit Suisse reported in its Corporate Center.  The repayment of these facilities \\nwill lead to materially lower funding costs in the third quarter and further benefits in the fourth quarter for \\nthe combined Group.  Continuing on the NII topic, sequentially for 3Q23, we  expect a low single -digit \\npercentage decline in our combined wealth management businesses, with positive contribution from the \\nCredit Suisse franchise, and a mid -single -digit percentage decline in our Swiss businesses.  This excludes the \\npull to par effec ts I mentioned earlier.  \\nThese elements, in combination with disciplined resource management and a focused execution mindset \\nacross the leadership team, give us confidence in our ability to deliver a successful integration, starting with \\napproaching break -even in the third quarter and returning to positive underlying profitability before the end \\nof the year.  \\nWith that I’ll hand back to Sergio for his closing remarks.   \\n \\n Page 14 of 27 \\n Sergio P. Ermotti – closing remarks  \\n \\nSlide 29 – Key messages  \\nThank you, Todd.  As we speak, the geopolitical and macroeconomic outlook remains volatile and difficult to \\npredict.  Of course, major developments on this front will impact our business in the short term.  As always, our \\nfirst priority is to stay close to clients and help them manage the challenges and opportunities presented by this \\nuncertain environment.  For us, this is  business as usual and we remain focused on this priority.    \\nAt the same time, we  will also execute on our integration plans with determination and pace.  That will unlock \\nsignificant economies of scale allowing us to fund future investments as we co ntinue to pursue growth \\nopportunities.  We are well aware of the additional trust and responsibility that accompany this transaction.  We \\nwill not betray that trust, remaining faithful to our strong culture and conservative risk management.   \\nI am excited a bout the opportunities that lie ahead of us.  I strongly believe UBS will emerge as a stronger \\nglobal financial institution, one of even greater value to its clients, while remaining safe and delivering \\nsuperior returns.  \\nWith that let’s get started with questions.   \\n \\n Page 15 of 27 \\n Analyst Q&A (CEO and CFO)  \\n \\nJeremy Sigee , Exane  BNP Paribas  \\nGood morning. Thank you very much for all the information. There's a lot to get through and a lot of \\nquestions. I'll just ask two things. One is , could you talk about the Swiss integration, which obviously takes \\ntime and I think you said it's going to legally close in 2024 and then physically integrate in 2025. I just \\nwondered, you know, what determines that timeframe and how you manage ? How you intend to keep the \\nbusinesses sta ble whilst they're in that slight sort of limbo period. So that's my first question.  \\nAnd the second question is about sort of capital stack. The 14% CET1 target  I imagine it implies that you're \\ngoing to reissue AT1 and rebuild the AT1 part of your capital  stack. And I saw a headline the other day that \\nyou might even do that this autumn. I just wondered if you could comment on that aspect, your intentions in \\nterms of issuing AT1. Thank you.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nThank you, Jeremy. So, well, first of all, on the integration, of  course, you know, now that we go through, as \\nI mentioned, it's very important to understand the sequence of how we're going to go through the merger of \\nthe different legal entities. You know, we, as I mentioned before, our intention is to merge the two pa rent \\ncompany, UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG.  And as a follow -through  different entities underneath will go \\nthrough the same process. So, we need to optimize the timing from different aspect s. And last but not least, \\nalso one of regulatory app rovals. So, we are starting now the process to do that in terms of the Swiss \\nbusiness.  \\nYou know, the way we will manage that is by, as I mentioned, first of all, assuring that all people employed in \\nthe Swiss businesses at UBS and Credit Suisse will not be  subject to any redundancies until the end of 2024. \\nSo, what's the most important message is to clients, that nothing changes for them and our view is to make it \\nvery smooth for clients to go through the transition.  \\nAnd so once we go through this kind of l egal process and regulatory process of merging the two entities, at \\nthe same time, we are also tackling the I T migration, the operational migration. And this is something that \\nwill only be completed early on in 2025.  So, what we, the message here is a balance between showing the \\nway forward to our people, to clients, but without rush and in a stable manner . So that people you , our \\nclients continue to be served in the way they expect to be served.  \\nIn terms of the CET1 target, we ll, of course, AT1 continues to be an important element of our capital stack \\nand strategy. I will not comment on speculations. We are watching the market carefully , we will assess the \\ntiming and the need of tapping the markets when appropriate.   But, yes o f course we are looking at the AT1 \\nmarkets and we will make our consideration when appropriate.  \\nAlastair Ryan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch  \\nYes. Thank you. It's Alastair, BofA. Sergio, good morning. Great to have clarity on the strategy and obviously \\nthe market is delighted as you are that the flows have come back. Just then on operating costs . Very clear \\nambitions and it looks like you're bringing forward a little 2027 to 2026 when you've landed everything . But \\njust given the size of the operating costs in the old Credit Suisse investment bank and non -core, can you give \\nus any sense about how quickly you can go there? So the  quite a large restructuring charge, integration \\n \\n Page 16 of 27 \\n charge in the second half, but does that cost number move out quickl y so that you normalize profitability or is \\nthere still quite a long, long tail to the cost in that part of the business? It's just, you know, IB classic, the \\nrevenues have gone, the costs are still lingering and how quickly they go? Thank you.  \\nTodd Tuckn er \\nHi, Alastair. Yeah. In terms of the speed at which we expect to take out cost. As Sergio and I said , we've been \\noperating at pace in terms of the cost takeout which is among our top priorities .  In terms of in particular \\nrestructuring the parts of Credit Suisse that need immediate attention and restructuring.  And so you see how \\nwe're making very strong progress out of the gate in terms of the cost takeout through the second half of \\n2023  and the cost to achieve those cost takeout as well.  \\nWe've obviously modeled to get to the targets that – or the landing zones that we described earlier in terms \\nof returns and the cost -to-income ratio at the end of 2026.  But as you say, the costs do have a long tail in \\nsome cases, and that's because of the complexity of the operation that we have to unpack .  Because  you \\nhave significant infrastructure and technology; you have a very large array of legal entities, over a thousand \\nlegal entities , that have to b e addressed.  \\nAnd just back one proof point on the software components, there are 3,000 applications and the work that \\nour team has done suggests that we will  only integrate 300 into UBS. That takes time. And so, yes, there is a \\nlong tail, but you can count  on us to operate quickly.  \\nThe last thing I would say is in terms of clarity on a sense of as those things hit through, because we give a \\ndegree of clarity through the second half of the year and we give sort of that landing zone, we will come \\nback with fu rther clarity once we do the business planning process in the second half of the year . ,And that \\nwill be with our fourth quarter earnings in early February.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nAnd I would probably complement Todd ’s observation. Because, i t is very important that de facto the vast \\nmajority of the assets are in non -core and legacy are supported by the Credit Suisse IB platform. So, as we \\nprogress in winding down the, call it, core day -to-day operation from the front office stand point of view . \\nWhatever is left is going to be  legacy infrastructure, IB infrastructure , that is only there for non -core. And so \\nyou can see out then this will be a very important element in determining how quickly we get rid of non -core \\nassets. Because as a consequence of that, we accelerate the wind ing down of this operation. But I think that's \\nexactly what we are working on and we will give you more detail early on next year when we present our Q4 \\nresults and our three year plan.  \\nChris Hallam, Goldman Sachs  \\nGood morning, everybody. And thanks for taking my questions. Just two for me. First, in Wealth  \\nManagement, you've talked about now essentially being at scale in every growth market globally. But in \\ntangible terms, what does that enhanced scale enable y ou to do that perhaps you weren't able to do \\npreviously? And have you seen any proactive response from competitors in reaction to that enhanced scale? \\nThat's my first question.  \\nAnd then second, looking at the banking business in Switzerland. Now the dust h as settled, does all the \\nvolatility we saw earlier in the year changed at all how you think strategically about running the combined \\n \\n Page 17 of 27 \\n Swiss bank be it in terms of capital, funding, liquidity, etc.? I guess just sort of simply has your risk appetite \\nchanged in Switzerland?  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nThank you. So, , look, in terms of scale, of course, there is an economy of scale. So, being able to leverage \\nUBS's IT platform as we onboard all the assets. It's a huge advantage because we have, call it, marginal cost s \\neffects. But also when you look at the ge ographic footprint of the two operations, they are extremely \\ncomplementary in some areas by relationships, but also in geographical terms, i.e. for example, in Brazil, right. \\nSo, we had a we had a lot of operation, Credit Suisse is much stronger, we now cr eate a very important \\nplayer . In Asia we've really reinforced our position and both in North Asia and Southeast Asia. I  think that in \\nSwitzerland its quite clear , And also across Europe where there are different markets where you know ideally \\nit's a very f ragmented market  in general, wealth management , particularly in Europe. So there, we create \\neconom ies of scales and things that we would have not been able to fund from our organic standpoint of \\nview. So, it's very important.  \\nAs I mentioned before also Cr edit Suisse across the board , in asset management , in wealth management \\nbrings capabilities and excellent products that can be then leveraged into our , into the UBS client franchise. \\nAnd we've seen the competitors .  I mean the reaction of competitors, of c ourse, they started to take \\nadvantage of the fragile situation of Credit Suisse already during 2022, late 2022 , of course, at the beginning \\nof the year. And it's a pretty normal situation so . Now having sa id that, I think that as you saw from the \\nflows, cl ients are now comfortable and they understand the value added of the franchise, we are able to \\nretain and actually re -attract back clients.   So, now it's our turn to be proactive and we will not spare any \\neffort to regain back any lost assets.  \\nSo, in term s of the Swiss has anything, is anything changing? I mean, it's very important to reiterate that \\nnothing changes in the way we run our Swiss businesses until they are fully integrated, right? So, from a \\nclient point of view , and in service , and in risk, and capital allocation, nothing changes. And even after we \\nmerged, our commitment, as I said in my remarks, is that we will continue to sustain the combined lending \\nbook. Of course, there are exceptional risky situations, but our principle is very clear.  One and one makes \\ntwo. We want to keep our market share in Switzerland. Switzerland is strategic, absolutely strategic for the \\nGroup, and we will not want to lose any of the market share we have today.  \\nKian Abouhossein, JP  Morgan  \\nYeah, good morning, Serg io and Todd. Thanks for taking my questions. First question is on risk weighted \\nassets. You have around USD 557 billion, USD 145 billion operational risk weighted assets. And I'm just \\nwondering how we should think about the exit run rates in 2026 in terms of total risk weighted assets as well \\nas in terms of operational risk weighted assets if I may. And then the second question is related to the non -\\ncore. Could you talk a little bit about the P&L effects of the non -core ex any more active write -downs or sal es, \\nso to say, leading to potential write -downs? I'm just trying to understand the P&L in terms of run rate of the \\nnoncore legacy bank, if I may. Thank you.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nHi Kian. In terms of the op risk RWA, we will come back next quarter after doing a fair bit of additional \\nmodeling in terms of the op risk RWA of the combined bank.  We've started to have initial views on that and \\ninitial discussions with our regulators an d that informed the 10 billion reduction that I spoke about in my \\ncomments. And then, in terms of the trajectory and how we think about the  5.57 towards 2026, you'll have \\n \\n Page 18 of 27 \\n more color on that after we complete the business planning process and our 3 YSP and come back early next \\nyear as mentioned.  \\nIn terms of , you asked about the P&L and the run rate in non -core. So, what I would say on that is . So first \\noff, the thing that's most important is to take costs out and to focus very significantly on the cost take out \\nbecause there's a significant level of overhead and costs that aren't associated with the wind down of the \\nportfolio. So, the way to think about it is that we have emphasized so far today that we have to take costs \\nout and effectively, the costs that s it in parts of Credit Suisse that don't work. And so, those costs, whether \\nthey be personnel costs or whether they be technology costs or real estate costs, they move into non -core \\nand legacy if they don't support the core businesses and they have to be ru n down extremely quickly. And so, \\nI would say, first and foremost, it's a cost .  The way to think about it is the cost rundown over the integration \\ntimeline. Then there's the asset rundown and we talked about the trajectory from a natural rundown \\nperspecti ve. And of course as Sergio mentioned that there will be strategically and actively looking at that. \\nAnd of course from that perspective, we have taken some PPA adjustments in excess of USD 5 billion relating \\nto non -core and legacy. I think that's a useful  way to think about it too, the fact that some of that pulls to par \\nand some of that will be fair value positions.  \\nAnd we will manage that book in the most capital efficient way that we can and dispose of positions as \\nappropriate. And also keeping just con sidering funding costs and the costs of operations, technology, people, \\netc. \\nKian Abouhossein, JP  Morgan   \\nOkay. Thank you. If I may just very briefly on the risk weighted assets, if I – to take a very simplistic view and I \\njust assume . I know the runoff, I  can make some assumptions about Basel IV then op risk which is clearly very \\ndifficult to predict if I want to be conservative. One could assume that ultimately the risk weighted assets \\nconservatively could not grow if at all to materially decline ? \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nKian, its, you know, we can't really comment right now. We are modeling. We are really going throug h the \\ndetails of the plan. We need to really also go through the exercise. I'm sure you appreciate when we put \\ntogether legal entities, the optimization of all that, it's a fairly complex operation.  \\nSo, I wouldn't go into a territory of projecting risk -weighted assets going forward because : one, there are two \\nelements – well, three elements. The starting point is a good starting point. We know that we can make some \\nadjustments in the next three to four months. Op risk  was one of the se subjects.  But then you need to go \\nthrough, first of all, what are the efficiencies we take out as we run down assets. Yes. What are the efficiency \\non optimizing legal e ntity operations? And then what is the growth? Because remember, we are going to \\ngrow , as well .  And we have to attach also that prospect into the equation. I wouldn't go into too much of a \\nrisk-weighted assets projection until you see what we tell you in Q3 and Q4 , for the Q4 results.  \\nFlora Bocahut, Jefferies  \\nYes. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I'd like to go back actually to some of the elements \\nyou have discussed on this call already, especially the NCL. Maybe trying to help us underst and how much of \\nthe ROCE T1 improvement towards 2026 is going to be driven by this unit, considering our move to natural \\nrunoff here, you know, trying to help us assess already at this stage what – how loss -making it is today and \\nhow loss - making it would e nd up being in 2026 , only consider ing the natural runoff.  \\n \\n Page 19 of 27 \\n And then the other question I wanted to raise is on the cost save. Just to make sure I understand correctly. So \\nyou basically have already a target of 3 billion cost saves on an annualized run rate at the end of this year.  \\nBut this is compared to the end of 2022 , I think. So, how much of the annualized 3 billion do you kind of \\nalready have, you know, in the 2 Q accounts, please? Thank you.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nThanks, Flora. So, in terms of , I'll take , maybe address the second point first. In terms of the cost save s in the \\n– in terms of what we're projecting by the end of the year at 3 billion. In terms of what we see already in the \\nsecond quarter, we haven't disclosed that specific number.  But I think from just the head count reductions \\nthat I mentioned in my rema rks, you could probably consider that there's somewhere more than , around half \\nhas already started to hit through, and what we're already seeing in our underlying results.  \\nIn terms of our CET1 and how to think about NCL as we go through the process . For su re, NCL is, you know, \\nis going to be something that weighs down on our CET1 naturally  Just given the fact that, you know, we \\nhave significant, at least over the 2024 to 2026 period .  If you just look at the natural profile rundown, which \\nis effectively ba sis for how we started thinking about the RoCET ,1 not the only way we started to model it, \\nbut, for sure, one of the ways that we were thinking about it. There's a drag by definition in the sense that, \\nby the end of 2026, you could see in the slide the nat ural profile has roughly half going away. Now, we can \\nmodel different scenarios as can you, but we're not going to discuss how we're thinking about it and \\nobviously, some of that is still very much unknown. In terms of the cost takeout, we would expect to be \\ntaking out the lion's share of the costs in non -core and legacy by the time the integration is materially \\ncomplete, by definition. We will do that. There’ll be, w e expect some residual carry that we'll have to take on \\nor continue to run down beyond 2026 . So, there is some, if you will, negative burn that is associated with \\nNCL in our modeling.  \\nStefan Stalmann, Autonomous Research  \\nGood morning and thank you very much for the presentation. I have two numbers questions, please. So, the \\nfirst one is on capitaliz ed software. You have taken these roughly 1.8 billion of software impairments in the \\nPPA. Can you give us a rough sense of how much of a remaining amount of capitalized software remains in \\nyour group  accounts that relates to CS? And is there a risk of fur ther impairments given that you want to \\nretain only about 10% of these systems?  \\nAnd the second question relates to your capital requirements. So, you show still at 10.6% CET1 over risk -\\nweighted assets. If we were to apply the current capital metric s that is outlined in Swiss banking law, what \\nwould be the capital requirement if there was no FINMA transitional forbearance , please ? Thank you very \\nmuch.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nOkay. Thanks, Stefan. In terms of the capitalized software, as you say, 1.8 billion was the amount that was in \\nthe Credit Suisse AG reported number today. I think in the PPA number overall in total, there was slightly \\nmore about 2 billion. You can look at the CS, you know, balance sheet from year end or Q1 , Q2, or sorry, Q1 \\nor yea r end and see, there was capitalized software in the neighborhood of 3 billion. So effectively what we \\nhave done is taken two -thirds down and have one -third left on a shorter economic useful life that aligns with \\nhow we think about : a), the time it's goin g to take us to fully decommission everything and b), leaving what \\nwe think we still get value from at the end. So, all that has been sort of factored into the PPA. So, I don't see \\n \\n Page 20 of 27 \\n necessarily further impairments, but because we now have just what's left , about a 1 billion that will have a \\nshorter economic useful life , that aligns to how we're thinking about the restructuring.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nStefan on CET1, I think when you look at the fully implemented regime in Switzerland which is not applicable \\nto us until 2027, it would be around 12.5% . 12-point -plus and that's you know the reason why we raised our \\nCET1 ratio was both to reflect, you know, a buffer there to accommodate for the restructuring, but also is a \\nclear, call it small , front r unning of what we expect to come .  As a consequence of that , and our , and the \\nfinalization of Basel III, which is partially already in our books. So, you can count on this number to be \\ncalibrated with a pretty medium term, medium to long -term expectation o f the current interpretation of all \\nregulatory regimes worldwide, including Switzerland.  \\nAnke Reingen, RBC  \\nThank you very much for taking my questions. The first is on revenue cost synergies. I mean, you had a \\ncomment and especially if you think you can ke ep this with market share unchanged. Is it something you \\nreally think maybe people get overly concerned and you don't see quite that risk of a revenue dissynergies \\neven if you potentially have to contract some of this a t bit more attractive rates or incent ivizing your advisors?  \\nAnd then secondly, on slide 16 where you show us the return path and there's this block about the funding \\ncost efficiencies. And that's something you – I guess apart from the drop out of the higher expense funding \\nat Credit Suisse, i s there other areas where you see the material benefits from lowering funding costs and \\noverall group  benefits because this block is the same size as the cost base rightsizing? Obviously can maybe \\nelaborate a bit more on that area. Thank you.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nLet me take the first question. First of all, I haven't said that we will keep our market share. I said that our \\nambition is to keep the market share. Now, having said that, Credit Suisse lost their market share and \\nbusiness in the  last 12 months or so.  \\nSo, what we count on is the fact that, you know, we will be able to recapture and regain some of the market \\nshare and what you saw lately in the last couple of months is a good sign of that. But, of course, we are not , \\nwe are realis tic and we are also factoring in that we may lose market shares because some clients may or may \\nnot feel, you know, that they want a certain concentration of risk. So, you know, there is no danger of us \\nbudgeting or planning blue -sky scenarios on that one.  We are realistic, but that should not be confused with \\nour desire to keep as much as we can.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nAnke, on the second , –the second question in terms of material benefits, we see you obviously highlighted \\nthe most significant one, which will be just the take out of t he significant cost that we were wearing in \\nconnection with the PLB and the ELA+ facilities. But , I would say, and, as I've remarked earlier, that we expect \\nthe positive contribution from the Credit Suisse wealth management franchise in our NII in 3Q and t hat \\ncomes principally from having stabilized the business and net new deposits that are also helping on NII. So, I \\nwould say that's another factor that is helping on the underlying profitability.  \\n \\n \\n Page 21 of 27 \\n Benjamin Goy , Deutsche Bank  \\nYes. Hi. Good morning. Two questions from my side. The firs t, to play devil's advocate, are there more \\noutflows to come or w here you kind of already had outflows from clients, but maybe some longer -term \\nstructures, partnerships or anything like that take time to see the outflows?  \\nAnd then secondly, for the first ti me in a while, your CET1 capital is higher than your tangible book value or \\nalmost the same. So now, the 15% return on CET1, should that also be broadly  similar to RoTE, going \\nforward, or should we expect more moving pa rts towards 2026? Thank you very much.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nThank you. Let me take the first questions. I guess, as I mentioned before, now, we are under wealth  \\nmanagement broader perimeter. I think that, of course, we may still have  client advisor s that resigned over \\nthe last three or four months or that , as they move into a new organization, they may be able to bring some \\nassets with them. What we see right now is clear that the ability of the people that left a while ago to really \\nmove assets is fairly limited. And this  is nothing new compared to what UBS went through 10 years ago or \\nmore than 10 years ago in recognizing that there is a lot of institutional loyalty of the client base. And now \\nthat we have stabilized the franchises, of course, we are even stronger in ret aining assets. And as I mentioned \\nbefore, our desires to re -bring back assets. So, look, the movement , the gross  movements are going to be \\nvery difficult to predict, but the net outcome we feel pretty comfortable will be positive.  \\nTodd T uckner  \\nAnd Benjamin, in terms of the return on CET1 versus RoTE impact, I'd say there are two factors that do argue \\nin favor of moving in that direction, just not yet but for sur e on the first one, the denominator effect we’re \\nbigger and so that's obviously going to make the difference between the historic RoTE versus RoCET1 smaller , \\nby definition. So – and you know that – so that denominator effect is now in play and it is helpful as you \\nsuggest probably as well, contributing to what you observe.  \\nThe other one though which has been our historic delta that really has given us pause to move off  of what \\nwe think is a more meaningful return measure are DTAs. But there of course, you know, as they amortize \\ndown, because these generally although not exclusively but generally relate to you know very old losses that \\nwe're you know now you know continuing to just chip away at as that balance comes down, then that's yet \\nanother factor that would argue in favor of moving to the other measure.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nWell, by the way, for the foreseeable future and from a the other angle of measuring our capital return \\nflexibility, the CET1 ratio is a better proxy because this is the true binding constrai nt. \\nBenjamin  Goy, Deutsche Bank  \\nFair enough and very clear. Thank you.  \\nAmit Goel , Barclays  \\nHi. Thank you and thanks for a lot of  good information. The first question was, I appreciate there's a lot of \\nmoving parts. We're going to spend a bit of time tryin g to update  estimates and all that kind of stuff. But in  \\n \\n Page 22 of 27 \\n terms of the path for the RoCET1 to get to that kind of 15% 2026 exit rate , are you able to give any color in \\nterms of expectation for 2024, 2025, or how you’d like it to trend?  \\nAnd then secondly , just on the costs. It'll be great to get a bit more color on the saving. So, I'm just kind of \\ncurious things like, you know, 10 billion gross , but how much net saving or how much reinvestment of that \\ndo you expect to do where you found the incrementa l 2 billion versus the 8 billion? And also , how you're \\nspending, you know, the 12 billion restructuring? Because it does seem like, you know, quite a big number. \\nSo, you know, just wondering if there could be benefits there as well. Thank you.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nHey Amit . So, as mentioned in terms of color, further  color on the trajectory as to we get end of 2023 to end \\nof 2026, we'll come back on that to provide  an update in 3Q as to where we are. But then, you know, a \\nmuch more fulsome perspective after our business planning processes is complete by the end of the year into \\nearly next year.  \\nIn terms of the cost savings, you know, Sergio also made , remarked in his comments. The gross number is \\ngreater than 10 billion as you highlight. But we will be making investments. We're go ing to grow our \\nbusiness. We're going to invest in technology. We're going to, you know, also deal with inflationary factors if \\nneed be. So, you know, that's all in the thinking around it, around half of the gross cost saves relate to \\neffectively restructu ring the Credit Suisse IB and CRU units. And the other half gross  relates to the synergies \\nwe expect to realize, but then that will be – they'll be investments back into the technology and the people to \\ngrow the core franchises.  \\nAndrew Lim , Société Générale  \\nHi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and thanks for all the detail. So, firstly, on the fair value \\nmarkdowns that you've taken there, related to that, could you give an idea of the maturity remaining on \\nthese  financial assets and how we should think about the reversal of those markdowns? So, you've \\nhighlighted more than 1.5 billion for the second half of this year. Is that the kind of run rate tha t we should \\nbe expecting going forward?  \\nAnd then secondly, on the NCL, perhaps I can ask it a different way. Do you have a better idea now of what \\nthe ultimate cumulative losses might be from the NCL? Would they be less than the 5 billion maybe that you \\nmight have been exposed to under the LPA agreement? That's my question there.  \\nAnd then thirdly, might I quickly ask, on the domestic side, certainly for some businesses, you will have a \\nsignificant market share. And I wonder if there's any maybe regula tory risk that that market share might be \\nlooked at and you'd be forced to bring it down to a level which is more palatable to the regulators. Thank \\nyou. \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nYeah. Because you asked three questions instead of two, I'll take the last one. On the market share one, as \\nyou know, we got regulatory approvals to basically not be subject to any competitive constraints, and that \\nwas done just to secure and be able to communicate and to be able to pla ce. Although it was already crystal \\nclear as it is today that th ere is no market share topics for the combined unit in Switzerland.  \\n \\n Page 23 of 27 \\n I mean if you go  across the board, cantonal banks are larger on any dimensions of relevant personal and \\ncommercial banking business in Switzerland. And when you measure in terms of branche s, we are combined \\nthe third largest player. So, now this is very relevant but because some people may argue, well, these \\ncantonal banks are combined versus you being one unit. Well, the fact , the truth of the matter is that we \\ncompete in those cantons with  the local cantonal banks. It's extremely relevant to make that difference.  \\nTherefore we will, of course , contribute what the competitive authorities have to say about it and put our \\nviews into it . But I don't really expect that on a fact based discussi ons we will be subject to any limitation or \\nmeaningful limitations in respect of our activities going forward.  \\nAndrew let me just unpack your first and second , I think they're related. So, on the first, you know as we \\nhighlighted earlier, we took around 15 billion of fair value marks on financial assets  and liabilities, 12.5 billion \\nwhere we indicated would pull to par because they relate to accrual accounted  positions and another  roughly \\n2.5 billion relate  to fair value positions where we had further markdo wn in light of liquidity model risk other \\ntype issues.  \\nOn the piece that pulls to par, just keep in mind that 4 billion of that 12.5 relates to non -core and legacy. So \\nthat's important to know and about 8.5 billion more in our core busines ses. On the core business piece, \\ngenerally speaking, we see three to four years that we should unwind between 70% and 80%. There will be \\na longer tail especially on some fixed rate loans that will go longer than that. So, we'll see pull -to-par effects \\nthat extend beyond the three - to four -year timeframe. But most of it will accrete to income over the shorter \\ntimeframe, as I mentioned.  \\nTo the NCL point though, since we have roughly 4 billion of the pull -to-par in NCL and roughly 2 billion in the \\nfair value  marks, so you have 5 to 6 billion of fair value adjustments in NCL. And I think, to go to your second \\nquestion, that's important to understand just given that we think that the positions are appropriately marked. \\nAnd from here, we will continue to consider all our optionality in terms of running down the portfolio, as \\nSergio mentioned earlier, in a most capital and cost efficient way. But we think the positions are being carried \\nat appropriate levels presently.  \\nAndrew Lim, Société Générale  \\nThat's great. That's really helpf ul. Thanks.  \\nAdam Terelak , Mediobanca  \\nMorning. Thank you for the questions. I want to get under the hood a little bit more in Wealth Management. \\nFirstly, on the CS business acquired, clearly there are some business exits to worry about some that you think \\nnon-core in the kind of the wealth management unit. Can you give us a sense of what the revenue attached \\nto that might look like. But also any detail on AT1 cost savings that come thr ough the NII in that division as \\nwell. \\nAnd then secondly, the competitive environment. I noticed in your GWM business , UBS standalone costs are \\nup on lower revenues. I just want to know kind of what the cost is to retain management at this point? What \\nare you  seeing the competitive landscape on the RM side or the advisors side, but also in your deposit side \\nwhat sort o f campaigns have you been running to re -attract deposits and how easy or difficult has that been \\nin the current rates and deposits environment? Thank you.  \\n \\n \\n Page 24 of 27 \\n Todd Tuckner  \\nThanks, Adam. On the second one, would just say in terms of GWM costs. So, there's very significant positive \\noperating leverage outside of the US, such important to note this is in the GWM – in the UBS subgroup \\nGWM, very significant positive o perating leverage. We were investing for growth in that business. But that \\nbusiness as well has been, you know, saw a strong NII performance and had strong PBT growth as I \\nhighlighted in my comments earlier.  \\nAs I also highlighted, it's more on the GWM over all side, just the fact that we've seen a lot of cash sorting \\nand rotation on NII in the Americas and that sort of pulled the Americas revenue down reasonably \\nsignificantly. So, quarter -on-quarter, year -on-year. And as a result, you know, we see that negat ive operating \\nleverage, but we're continuing to invest in that business across the board  and so some of that as well, \\ncontributes to the higher cost.  \\nOn your deposit campaign question I would say that you know like any bank, we value deposits, we value \\ndeposits in the win -back context in wealth management. We also just value deposits to fund  our business, \\nloan growth, et cetera, so there's nothing I've seen that I would call out there in terms of deposit betas that \\nhave moved in a direction I would consi der to be anything other than what we see across peers.  \\nIn terms of the acquired – you were asking business exits and the revenue attached. At this point, we have in \\nterms of what's being expected to move into non -core and legacy that was highlighted on on e of the earlier \\nslides. The revenue attached with that business is less than 100 million on an annualized basis in terms of net \\nrevenues, in terms of what's moving across. And that's of course you know not risk -adjusted for – and so \\nthat, that needs to  be considered. In terms of AT1 cost savings that hit through the business from what had \\nbeen , say, anything there has really just been captured in the Credit Suisse Corporate Center as an offset \\npotentially to the inflated cost so I would expect that  that'l l normalize now as you know as the businesses \\ncome together.  \\nAdam Terelak, Mediobanca  \\nSo, funding it seems that is in the corporate center and not in the divisions ? \\nSerio P. Ermotti  \\nCan you repeat? It wasn't clear. Sorry.  \\nAdam Terelak, Mediobanca  \\nSo, any funding  noise, AT1  versus  liquidity facility resourced out in the corporate center rather than in -house?  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nYeah. That was our understanding from Credit Suisse's practice pre -acquisition, yes.  \\nAdam Terelak, Mediobanca  \\nOkay. Thank you.  \\n \\n \\n Page 25 of 27 \\n Andrew Coombs , Citigroup  \\nGood morning it’s Andrew Coombs from Citi and  thank  you for taking my questions. Two if I may. Firstly, I \\nwant to turn back to follow up on the PPA pull-to-par bit  in relationship to the restructuring charges. You \\nmade this comment th at, out of the period at end of 2026, I think restructuring charges will be largely but \\nnot wholly offset by the PPA pull-to-par effect . And then in your later comments, you talked about probably \\n0.5 billion of pull -to- par effect, of which 4.5 would be noncore, and that most of that would be recognized \\nin a three - to four -year timeframe. So, can we assume restructuring charges of the magnitude of 12.5? And \\ncan you give us a feel for the timing of those relative to the PPA pull-to-par? \\nAnd then th e second question is on slide 29. You provid e a useful quarterly trajectory going from minus 0.3 \\nbillion in Q2 and you talked about breakeven in Q3. But you also flagged 750 million of savings, 550 million \\nof funding cost savings. There's a 650 million arguably one -off ECL charge on the non-credit  impaired CS \\nportfolio data this quarter. So, just trying to understand the going from minus 0.3 billion to 0, even with all \\nthose additional benefits Q -on-Q, what's the offset? I guess there'd be some seasonal ity on revenue, a bit of \\na decline in NII. But any more color there?  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nSo, Andrew, in terms of – I’ll take the second point first – in terms of the story on the underlying profitability, \\nyeah, I m ean just be very clear that the cost saves that we expect to see by the end of 2023 of 3 billion, which \\nwe think you can price into 2024, some of that has been realized. But as I would – the way I would think \\nabout it is there is work that's ongoing and w e expect that the greater than 3 billion number is something \\nthat we'll see at the end of the year hitting through. I would continue to reemphasize the funding cost point \\nthat was in 2Q that will benefit 3Q and fully in 4Q that helps. And then the stabili zation as flows and all that \\nwill sort of hit through as we go on an underlying basis. And as I said, we expect to break even in the third \\nquarter coming out of roughly a 300 million - plus improvement. And then to be positive in 4Q for the reasons \\nthat I mentioned.  \\nIn terms of the restructuring you asked about, we'll come back in further details in terms of how much \\nrestructuring specifically there'll be. We're giving a perspective that we expect the number to be broadly \\noffset by  the pull -to-par effect s. But at this point in time, we're going to need to detail that out in the \\nbusiness planning process and come back, as we have said, with our fourth quarter earnings.   \\nAndrew Coombs  \\nThank you.  \\nVishal Shah , Morgan Stanley  \\nHi. Thank you so mu ch for your questions. My first one is on wealth management. Just wanted to get a sense \\non you know how you are assessing you know the business overlaps in that segment – in that segment or \\nyou've had you know further  chance to sort of you know look at you  know different regions and how to \\nrespond to all the ongoing competitive pressures and in terms of you know relationship managers and then \\nsort of bankers in that segment? So, if you could give a bit of an update on that side?  \\nAnd then the second one is o n the investment bank , the CS non -core perimeter of 55 billion. I know in one of \\nyour slides have provided a natural run-off rate, but I was just trying to get a sense if you could provide any \\nsort of color in terms of what is your sort of ambition on ac tively winding down this perimeter in terms of \\n \\n Page 26 of 27 \\n timeline, i.e., could we expect you know the next two years basically by 2025 you know broadly most of this \\nrun down to be done. Is that is that a fair assumption or are you looking at it in a bit of a differe nt way? \\nThank you so much.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nHey, Vishal. I mean I think on this on that second question, we've addressed that in the sense that you know \\nwe offer the natural rundown just given you know of course, we have to take care and ensure that we're \\nprotecting our counterparties and we're doing things in the best interests of the firm and so on these \\npositions that we , you know, we will look – we will look strategically to exit them as quickly as possible. But \\nat this point, I would say, we'll come back and give you progress as we've done already in 2Q in terms of the \\nactual RWA reduction relative to the natural runoff profile. We'll continue to do that. And to the extent we \\ncan give more color through our planning process, we will. But again, these are positions wher e we think, \\nnaturally, there'll be strategic exits and opportunities that arise and not something we'll, I will be disclosing.  \\nIn terms of your first question on Wealth Management and assessing business overlaps, I mean, in general, \\nthe way we approach the  integration is to look at Credit Suisse  is adding value in a lot of the areas in which \\nwe already operate. But also, as Sergio mentioned, areas where we have less of a presence. Brazil was \\nmentioned. There are important parts of the Middle East where that' s the case; important parts of Southeast \\nAsia. Also, much bigger in Europe overall. So, in terms of assessing the overlaps, I mean, in the end of the \\nday, relationship managers have their client relationships and we want to retain them all. And of course, \\nwe're looking at how to manage the business in the most efficient and effective way.  \\nI would make one additional comment which is very important, which is that Iqbal had  announced the area \\nmarket heads on a combined basis, and that was very important just in the last several weeks and was in  \\ncomments Sergio made as well, because when we start integrating how we approach the market and so \\nwe're in the market on an integrated basis , which, of course, just took time even though we move quickly in  \\nthe two and a half months since we've closed, to be in the market on an integrated basis having market \\nheads that have now been decided across wealth management on a combined and integrated basis is quite a \\nstep that helps us to manage some of the business ov erlaps and competitive pressures that you were asking \\nabout.  \\nVishal Shah, Morgan Stanley  \\nOkay. Thank you so much.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nOkay. The last answer and questions and I'm sure we're going to have a chance to stay in touch between \\nnow and November 7th when we announce the Q3 results. For the time being, thank you for dialing in. \\nThanks for your questions. And well as I say, looking forward to staying in touch. Thank you.  \\n  \\n \\n Page 27 of 27 \\n Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward -Looking Statements |  This document contains statements that constitute “forward -looking statements,” \\nincluding but not limited to management’s outlook for UBS’s financial performance, statements relating to the anticipated eff ect of transactions and \\nstrategic initiatives on UBS’s business and future  development and goals or intentions to achieve climate, sustainability and other social objectives. While \\nthese forward -looking statements represent UBS’s judgments, expectations and objectives concerning the matters described, a number of risks , uncertai nties \\nand other important factors could cause actual developments and results to differ materially from UBS’s expectations. The Rus sia–Ukraine war continues to \\naffect global markets, exacerbate global inflation, and slow global growth. In addition, the war  has caused significant population displacement, and \\nshortages of vital commodities, including energy shortages and food insecurity, and has increased the risk of recession in OE CD economies. The coordinated \\nsanctions on Russia and Belarus, and Russian and  Belarusian entities and nationals, and the uncertainty as to whether the war will widen and intensify, may \\ncontinue to have significant adverse effects on the market and macroeconomic conditions, including in ways that cannot be ant icipated. UBS’s acquisi tion \\nof Credit Suisse has materially changed our outlook and strategic direction and introduced new operational challenges. The in tegration of the Credit Suisse \\nentities into the UBS structure is expected to take between three to five years and presents si gnificant risks, including the risks that UBS Group AG may be \\nunable to achieve the cost reductions and other benefits contemplated by the transaction. This creates significantly greater uncertainty about forward -\\nlooking statements. Other factors that may affect our performance and ability to achieve our plans, outlook and other objectives also include, but are not \\nlimited to: (i)  the degree to which UBS is successful in the execution of its strategic plans, including its cost reduction and efficiency in itiatives and its ability \\nto manage its levels of risk -weighted assets (RWA) and leverage ratio denominator (LRD), liquidity coverage ratio and other financial resources, including  \\nchanges in RWA assets and liabilities arising from higher market volatility an d the size of the combined bank; (ii)  the degree to which UBS is successful in \\nimplementing changes to its businesses to meet changing market, regulatory and other conditions, including as a result of the  acquisition of Credit Suisse; \\n(iii) increased infla tion and interest rate volatility in major markets; (iv)  developments in the macroeconomic climate and in the markets in which UBS operates \\nor to which it is exposed, including movements in securities prices or liquidity, credit spreads, currency exchange rates, deterioration or slow recovery in \\nresidential and commercial real estate markets, the effects of economic conditions, including increasing inflationary pressur es, market developments, \\nincreasing geopolitical tensions, and changes to national trade p olicies on the financial position or creditworthiness of UBS’s clients and counterparties, as \\nwell as on client sentiment and levels of activity, including the COVID -19 pandemic and the measures taken to manage it, which have had and may also \\ncontinue to h ave a significant adverse effect on global and regional economic activity, including disruptions to global supply chains and labor market \\ndisplacements; (v)  changes in the availability of capital and funding, including any adverse changes in UBS’s credit s preads and credit ratings of UBS, Credit \\nSuisse, sovereign issuers, structured credit products or credit -related exposures, as well as availability and cost of funding to meet requirements for debt \\neligible for total loss -absorbing capacity (TLAC), in part icular in light of the acquisition of Credit Suisse; (vi)  changes in central bank policies or the \\nimplementation of financial legislation and regulation in Switzerland, the US, the UK, the European Union and other financial  centers that have imposed, \\nor resulted in, or may do so in the future, more stringent or entity -specific capital, TLAC, leverage ratio, net stable funding ratio, liquidity and funding \\nrequirements, heightened operational resilience requirements, incremental tax requirements, additional l evies, limitations on permitted activities, constraints \\non remuneration, constraints on transfers of capital and liquidity and sharing of operational costs across the Group or other  measures, and the effect these \\nwill or would have on UBS’s business activi ties; (vii)  UBS’s ability to successfully implement resolvability and related regulatory requirements and the potential \\nneed to make further changes to the legal structure or booking model of UBS in response to legal and regulatory requirements and any add itional \\nrequirements due to its acquisition of Credit Suisse, or other developments; (viii)  UBS’s ability to maintain and improve its systems and controls for complying \\nwith sanctions in a timely manner and for the detection and prevention of money launder ing to meet evolving regulatory requirements and expectations, \\nin particular in current geopolitical turmoil; (ix)  the uncertainty arising from domestic stresses in certain major economies; (x)  changes in UBS’s competitive \\nposition, including whether diffe rences in regulatory capital and other requirements among the major financial centers adversely affect UBS’s ability to \\ncompete in certain lines of business; (xi)  changes in the standards of conduct applicable to our businesses that may result from new reg ulations or new \\nenforcement of existing standards, including measures to impose new and enhanced duties when interacting with customers and i n the execution and \\nhandling of customer transactions; (xii)  the liability to which UBS may be exposed, or possible  constraints or sanctions that regulatory authorities might \\nimpose on UBS, due to litigation, contractual claims and regulatory investigations, including the potential for disqualificat ion from certain businesses, \\npotentially large fines or monetary penalt ies, or the loss of licenses or privileges as a result of regulatory or other governmental sanctions, as well as the \\neffect that litigation, regulatory and similar matters have on the operational risk component of our RWA, including as a resu lt of its acqu isition of Credit \\nSuisse, as well as the amount of capital available for return to shareholders; (xiii)  the effects on UBS’s business, in particular cross -border banking, of \\nsanctions, tax or regulatory developments and of possible changes in UBS’s policie s and practices; (xiv)  UBS’s ability to retain and attract the employees \\nnecessary to generate revenues and to manage, support and control its businesses, which may be affected by competitive factor s;

Materials and a webcast \\nreplay are available at www.ubs.com/investors   \\n \\n \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\n \\nSlide 3 – Key Messages  \\nThank you, Sarah, good morning, everyone. I am happy to be back here with all of you.  \\nAnd i t is an honor and privilege to lead UBS once again, especially at such a pivotal time for our organization \\nand for all our stakeholders.  First of all, I’d like to thank Ralph, the management team and all of our \\nemployees for their dedication over the last two  and a half years. During this time, UBS delivered record \\nresults and continued to build trust and confidence with our clients and our stakeholders.  \\nOur performance this quarter demonstrates that we continue to be a source of stability for our clients during \\nperiods of significant uncertainty.  Our strong flows across Global Wealth Management and Asset \\nManagement reflect our clients’ continued confidence and trust in us.  \\nThe results include an increase in litigation provisions relating to U.S. residential mortgage -backed securities. \\nWe are in advanced discussions with the U .S. Department of Justice, and I am pleased that we are making \\nprogress towards resolving this legacy matter that dates back 15 years.  \\nOn an underlying basis, which also excludes litigation, our result s were solid, with a return on CET1 capital of \\n16.5% and a cost -to-income ratio of 72.8%.  \\nWhen I left UBS in 2020, our strength and stability put us in a position to consider all options for our future, \\nincluding transformative acquisitions. Today, UBS is  stronger than ever, with diversified revenue streams, \\ncontinued capital and liquidity strength, disciplined risk management, and a balance sheet for all seasons.  As \\na result, we are well prepared to be part of the solution to rescue Credit Suisse and contribute to financial stability in Switzerland and globally.  \\nDespite its complexity, I am convinced that this transaction will also provide value for the clients and \\nemployees of the combined organization. The acquisition enables us to benefit from the significant franchise \\nvalue, and in many cases, complementary businesses within Credit Suisse.  \\n \\n Page 2 of 21 \\n Slide 4 – Our clients turned to us as they searched for stability  \\nFor our clients, the first quarter was largely a continuation of the themes from 2022. Clients continue to be \\nconcerned about the impact that inflation and central bank policy will have on economic growth, especially in \\nthe U .S. While our wealth management clients remained on the sidelines, our advisors helped them identify \\nopportunities to manage their liquidity and diversify risks.  \\nAs a result, we benefited from 20 billion dollars in net new fee -generating assets globally, an annualized growth \\nrate of 6%.  Net new money in GWM was 28 billion. Importantly, 7 billion of this came in the ten business  days \\nafter the acquisition announcement. This is a further testament to how clients turn to us as they search for \\nstability.  \\nDuring the first quarter, we helped our clients diversify cash holdings as they shifted deposits into money market funds and T -Bills. In Asset Management, we saw another 18 billion dollars in money market inflows, with strong \\ncontributions from our U .S. wealth management clients.  We saw further deleveraging, particularly in the \\nAmericas, but also in APAC and EMEA. This was offset by loan growth in Switzerland, resulting in stable loan balances quarter -on-quarter, excluding FX.  \\nCompared to last year’s very strong first quarter, institutional clients were less active, particularly in equity \\nderivatives and cash as they lacked conviction in an uncertain market. However, we did have strong \\nperformances in Prime Brokerage and electronic FX.   \\nSlide 5 - Continued client momentum with positive net new money in all regions  \\nClients continue to turn to us for advice in managing their assets, inc luding their liquidity.  \\nWhat is important is deposit shifts into money markets and T- bills remained with UBS and we also saw \\n9 billion in new deposits into our platform. This supported positive net new money across all of our regions in \\nthe first quarter. Let me go through each of the regions in more detail.  \\nIn the Americas, our Separately Managed Account initiative with Asset Management further supported net new fee- generating assets. And during the period of significant disruption in March, we saw positive inflows \\nfrom our clients. As a result, we had solid net new money for the quarter. Our advisor recruiting momentum \\nalso continued and should support flows in future periods, aligned with our continued growth ambitions in \\nthe U.S.  \\nThe strength o f our business in Switzerland resulted in another quarter of inflows into mandates and other \\ninvestment products.  \\nIn EMEA, clients continue to be cautious overall, but net new money was positive, and net interest income \\nrose by nearly 60% as we started to benefit from higher Euro rates.  \\nLastly, while our clients in Asia Pacific continued to take a wait -and- see approach in terms of transactions, we \\nsaw broad -based flows into net new fee -generating assets. We have now seen 17% net new fee-generating \\nasset growth in APAC over the last twelve months.   \\n \\n Page 3 of 21 \\n Slide 6 – Enhancing client franchises through the announced acquisition of Credit Suisse  \\nWhen I first became UBS’s Group CEO in 2011, we positioned our asset gathering and Swiss businesses at the \\nheart of our stra tegy. We successfully restructured our Investment Bank by reducing non- core markets activities \\nand assets with discipline. We solidified our capital position. And we took decisive actions to strengthen our \\nculture. As a result of our efforts, we restored trust with all our stakeholders, materially de -risked our business \\nand generated significant amounts of capital for our shareholders. As we now embark on another \\ntransformational step in UBS’s journey, our principles will remain the same.  \\nWe will be laser -focused on delivering the best possible outcome for our unrivaled client franchises, our \\nemployees, our shareholders and for all of Switzerland. We will do this by maintaining our strong culture and \\nfocus on prudent risk management.  \\nThe combination of UBS a nd Credit Suisse will result in around 5 trillion of invested assets, which is the \\nequivalent for us of 7 to 10 years of net new money. It will make us the second largest wealth manager in the \\nworld. Importantly, it will reinforce our position as the only truly global player among the leading wealth \\nmanagers with strategic scale and complementary capabilities in the most attractive growth markets. We will \\nreinforce our leading position in APAC, Switzerland and EMEA and will significantly enhance our position in Latin America.  \\nIn Asset Management, the combination will improve our positioning globally and in Europe. But more \\nimportantly, we will bring together two highly complementary businesses to increase our scale and accelerate \\nour strategic growth plans.  With the combination, our clients will benefit from an enhanced offering in \\nAlternatives, Credit and Thematics, with additional scale for our Index platform.  \\nWe are already the leading bank in Switzerland. This is not a result of our size or market share,  but our expert \\ncapabilities and the global reach we provide our clients. The combination with Credit Suisse will reinforce these \\nstrengths.  There is strong competition in the Swiss market. For example, the combined market share of UBS \\nand Credit Suisse in  mortgages and in loans to corporates and public institutions is lower than that of the \\ncantonal banks.  Raiffeisen has twice as many branches as UBS and Credit Suisse combined.  So, customers have \\nplenty of options and we will have to work hard to earn and retain their relationships. As we think about the \\nfuture of this business, my commitment is that we will look at the best option to create most value for both \\nfranchises in the interest of our clients, employees, shareholders and society at large. This assessment will be based on facts, not emotions.  \\nGlobally, we will stay true to our capital -light and client -focused investment bank model, which we will leverage \\nacross the organization while benefiting from diversification and complementary capabilities. As a result, the \\nInvestment Bank will account for around 25% of Group risk weighted assets on day -1 and beyond.  \\nActivities outside of our strategic focus and risk appetite will be run -down in the best interests of our \\nshareholders while minimizing the risk of potential losses to the Swiss taxpayers. We are excited about the \\nopportunity to deliver the combined strengths of both firms to an expanded client base. And initial conversations with our clients suggest they agree and recognize the  value of the combined organization.   \\nThere is much to do, and there will be difficult decisions to be made over the coming months. Transformations don’t happen in a straight line – we know that from our own experience. But we are confident in our ability to \\n \\n Page 4 of 21 \\n deliver on the end -state, as well as our existing growth ambition in the U .S. and APAC to create long- term \\nvalue for all our stakeholders.  \\nBefore I hand over to Sarah, I ’d like to provide a brief update on the status of the acquisition.  \\nWe have receiv ed the required approvals from the Swiss authorities, including FINMA, as well as the UK’s PRA \\nand the US Federal Reserve. Additional required approvals are being expedited, and we continue to expect the \\ntransaction to close in the second quarter.  \\nSince t he deal is pending, we are limited in what we can communicate at this time, but we remain committed \\nto providing as much transparency as possible once information becomes available. Sarah will take you through \\nour high- level plan to provide you with more i nformation on the transaction.  \\nOne of my immediate priorities is our people across both organizations. We look forward to welcoming our \\nnew colleagues at UBS. Until closing, we are restricted in the extent we can engage , and we are doing as much \\nas we can  given these restrictions. We have a lot of work ahead of us to bring our firms together and this \\ntransaction will present interesting and challenging opportunities to our current and future employees.  We will \\nbe one team upon closing of the transaction, a nd we want the best people to take UBS forward.  \\nI am also focused on establishing our target operating model and organizational structure. It is clear that while we manage this integration, we need a model that will allow us to stay close to clients and, deliver on our \\nambitions and financial targets while also minimizing distractions. Over the coming weeks, I will provide you \\nwith more information on this.  \\nIn summary, our strategy, capital strength, risk management and culture are what have put us in a po sition \\ntoday to deliver solid underlying results against a challenging market backdrop.  All of these factors will also \\nplay an important role as we deliver on our integration plans. While the task ahead of us is challenging and \\nurgent, we believe that the acquisition of Credit Suisse presents a unique opportunity to generate significant, \\nlong-term value to all of our stakeholders.  \\nIn particular, I am convinced that this transaction will help to reinforce the leading position of the Swiss financial center a nd will be of benefit to the entire economy.  As we start writing our next chapter, I am looking forward \\nto working with my executive team, and my colleagues across UBS and Credit Suisse, to build an organization \\nthat our clients, employees, shareholders an d Switzerland can be proud of.  \\nWith that, I hand over to Sarah.    \\n \\n Page 5 of 21 \\n Sarah Youngwood \\n \\nSlide 8 – 1Q23 net profit USD 1.0bn; 9.1% RoCET1  \\nThank you, Sergio.  Good morning, everyone.  \\nStarting on slide 8 – Our first quarter reported net profit of 1 billion dollars included a 665 million provision \\nrelated to the advanced discussions with the D OJ regarding our legacy RMBS litigation matter.  \\nOn an underlying basis, we delivered solid results while maintaining a balance sheet for all seasons, and \\nagainst an uncertain market backdrop. Underlying profit before tax was 2.4 billion dollars, with a return on \\nCET1 of 16.5% and a cost/income ratio of 72.8%, in line with our Group targets. You will find the delta \\nbetween reported and underlying performance in the appendi x. \\nUnderlying revenue was down 8% and expense was down 2%. FX impacted revenue and expense for a positive net impact of 15 [edit: 14 million ]. The net credit loss expense was 38 million dollars, compared with \\n18 million last year – all low levels, reflecting the high quality of our loan book. With 94% collateralization, \\nour portfolio remains very resilient in the current environment.    \\nSlide 9 – 1Q23 total revenues USD 8.7bn \\nLet’s start with revenue on slide 9 – Our underlying revenue ex -FX was down 8% with an increase from NII in \\nGWM and P&C more than offset by lower asset -based and transaction fees, as well as lower IB revenue.  \\nWhat is driving this picture is a macroeconomic environment characterized by a decrease in equity markets as well as lower lev els of client, M&A and capital market activity versus last year. However, we continued to see \\nthe benefit of higher rates and solid activity in fixed income.   \\nSlide 10 – Net interest income  \\nMoving to NII on page 10 – In the first quarter, NII of 2.2 billio n dollars was up 520 million, or 31% year -on-\\nyear.  \\nQuarter- on-quarter, NII was up 3%, in line with overall guidance. This reflects the benefits of our global \\ndiversification, as increases in Swiss Franc and Euro more than offset reductions in US Dollar NII.  \\nMoving to the chart, in the second column, the increase was driven by the benefit of rates. This was largely \\noffset by changes in deposit mix.  Our experience this quarter is in line with the trends we have seen over the \\nlast year. Our clients have continued to shift some of their balances from sweeps into higher -yielding \\nproducts. We will come back to money market funds and treasury bonds, but within deposits, clients have \\nmoved into our attractive saving accounts and CDs.   \\nMoving to deposit v olumes – Total deposits decreased 3% sequentially. However, it is important to note that \\nthese funds have not left our platform. At the start of the year, often based on our investment advice, we \\nhave seen clients repositioning from deposits into Money Mar ket funds and Treasuries within our platform. In \\nfact, we retained these balances, and on top of that, in GWM, we had 9 billion dollars of net new deposits \\ninto UBS mostly driven by the U .S., after March 10.  \\n \\n Page 6 of 21 \\n Looking ahead, based on the current forwards – F or 2Q23, we anticipate a mid- single digit decrease versus \\n1Q23, as slight increases in P&C are expected to be offset by reductions in GWM. We also expect the full year \\nto be broadly in line with 4Q annualized.   \\nSlide 11 – Executing our cost strategy  \\nNow, t urning to costs on page 11 – We had reported operating expense of 7.2 billion. This included the \\nlitigation provision mentioned earlier and 70 million acquisition costs. Excluding these and FX, this quarter’s operating expense was down 1%, as reductions in variable comp more than offset inflationary pressures on \\nsalaries, investments in technology, T&E and redundancy costs.  \\nOn redundancy costs, we saw 68 million of expense related to initiatives across GWM, IB and AM this quarter.  We expect the benefit of these actions to materialize in the following quarters.  \\nFor 2023, on a standalone basis, we still expect costs ex -litigation and FX to increase by net 2 to 3% year -on-\\nyear and we are on track to deliver on our gross cost saving program of 1.1 billion.    \\nSlide 12 – Global Wealth Management  \\nLet’s move to our businesses – starting with GWM on page 12.  \\nGWM profit before tax in the quarter was 1.2 billion dollars.  \\nRevenue was 2% lower than last year, with asset -based and transaction revenue down in all regions , partially \\noffset by net interest income. We continue to actively manage deposits across margins, volumes and mix, \\ndriving NII up 31% year -on-year. NII was down 1% sequentially.  \\nOperating expense ex -litigation and FX was flat year -on-year. \\nWe delivered net new money of 28 billion dollars, with net inflows in all regions. Net new fee -generating \\nassets were 20 billion dollars in the quarter, an annualized growth rate of 6%, mostly into advisory mandates and SMAs.   \\nSlide 13 – Asset Management \\nMovi ng to Asset Management, on page 13 – with a profit before tax of 94 million dollars.  \\nTotal revenue decreased 13%, with lower net management fees, driven by market headwinds, asset mix and \\nFX, as well as lower performance fees net of the pass -through referred to on this page.  \\nThe cost /income ratio was 81%, with lower revenue, and operating expense up 1%. The team has taken \\naction to address this negative operating leverage, the benefits of which you will see in the coming quarters.  \\nNet new money in the quarter was 14 billion dollars , delivering a strong net new money annualized growth \\nrate of over 5%. This includes 18 billion dollars into money markets, as we successfully captured client demand for cash -like solutions.   \\n \\n Page 7 of 21 \\n Slide 14 – Investment Bank  \\nNow onto the IB on slide 14 – The IB delivered 477 million dollars in profit before tax and a 15% return on \\nattributed equity.  \\nRevenue in Global Markets of 2.0 billion dollars was down 15% ex -FX, against a record first quarter last year.  \\nIn Equities, activity levels  decreased in all regions, particularly in equity derivatives and cash equities. Despite \\nthis, we delivered the best quarter on record in our Prime Brokerage and a very strong performance in eFX.  \\nWith very different market conditions versus the beginning of last year, we were up 1% in FRC with credit more than offsetting FX and Rates.  \\nGlobal Banking revenue was down 30%, as the positive momentum at the start of the year was interrupted by \\nthe sudden uptick in uncertainty in financials in March, affecting client sentiment. Against this backdrop, we \\noutperformed the global fee pool, with particular strength in APAC and EMEA. Within M&A, we saw market outperformance across all regions.  \\nOperating expense was down 5% ex -litigation and FX, primarily driven by lo wer variable compensation, and \\nwith cost savings initiatives largely offsetting inflationary pressures on salaries.  \\nSlide 15 – Personal & Corporate Banking (CHF)  \\nWrapping up on the businesses with the excellent performance in P&C on page 15 – Profit befor e tax in the \\nfirst quarter was 553 million Swiss francs, the best quarter in almost 15 years, when excluding one -off gains.  \\nThis result was largely driven by 32% higher NII.  \\nOverall, total revenue rose 18% year -on-year, including record transaction -based income and stable recurring \\nfees. \\nWe consistently engaged with our clients and were able to deliver 860 million of net new investment products, an annualized growth rate of 16%. We also saw 1.7 billion of net new loans while net new depos its were negative 1.8 billion, as positive flows in Personal Banking were more than offset by outflows in \\nCorporate and Institutional Clients, mainly driven by investment activities.  \\nWe delivered a cost /income ratio of 52%, a 7 percentage point improvement year -over-year. This reflects 5% \\nhigher costs, largely reflecting technology investments.  This consistent focus on our digital transformation \\ncontinues to pay off. We saw an 11 percentage point increase year -on-year in the share of Personal Banking \\nclients that are active mobile users – which benefits our clients and creates operational efficiencies.   \\nSlide 16 – We continued to maintain a strong liquidity and capital position  \\nNow moving to slide 16 – At times of uncertainty, our clients continue to turn to UBS as a safe harbor. We \\nhave a strong capital and liquidity position, risk management, and a balance sheet for all seasons.  \\nAs we continue to prudently manage our resources , we maintained healthy liquidity buffers with an LCR of \\n162% and an NSFR of 118%, broadly stable QoQ.  We maintained 144 billion cash balances, which is 29% \\nof deposits and more than half of our HQLA.  In total, 90% of our HQLA qualifies as level one, whi ch is the \\nhighest quality of liquid assets.  In line with our liquidity management principles, we continue to target a diversified funding mix, across regions and products, including deposit types.  \\n \\n Page 8 of 21 \\n UBS has not tapped into any of the SNB facilities and we expect to continue not to do so.   \\nSlide 17 – Common equity tier 1 capital  \\nMoving to capital on page 17 – At 13.9%, we continued to have a strong capital position, comfortably above \\nour 13% guidance and 10.4% regulatory requirement.  \\nOn the walk – starting at 14.2% at the end of last quarter. Net profit contributed 30 basis points, offset by \\ncapital returns to our shareholders at around 50 basis points. The net currency effect was close to nil quarter -\\non-quarter, as the FX impact on CET1 and RWA offset each other.  \\nIn the first quarter, we have repurchased 1.3 billion dollars of shares. While we remain committed to our \\ncapital return policy, including progressive dividends and buybacks, we have temporarily suspended share \\nrepurchases in light of the planned acquisition of Credit Suisse, and we intend to resume them as soon as \\npossible.   \\nSlide 18 – Indicative timing of communication related to the acquisition of Credit Suisse  \\nOn slide 18 – As you heard from Sergio, we are committed to providing as much transparency as possible, as \\ninformation becomes available. On this slide, we summarized the sequence of disclosures. Let me highlight a few items. The first column refers to the registration statement with the SEC, which is a requirement for the close.  It will include pro forma financials as of December 31st 2022. Assuming we close as expected in the \\nsecond quarter, 2Q earnings will include consolidated financial statements for the combined Group under IFRS and in U .S. Dollar s, and in order for us to have time to pr epare that information, our earnings date is likely to \\nchange. After that, we plan to update you regularly.  \\nSlide 19 – Key messages  \\nWrapping up – In 1Q23, we delivered a solid set of underlying results with strong flows, as clients continue to \\nturn to us for advice and stability in uncertain times.  \\nLooking ahead – the acquisition of Credit Suisse is a great opportunity to accelerate our strategic plans. We \\nwill execute the work that needs to be done with discipline, while remaining focused on delivering for our clients, shareholders and all other stakeholders.  \\nWith that, let’s open up for questions.   \\n \\n Page 9 of 21 \\n Analyst Q&A (CEO and CFO)  \\n \\nChis Hallam, Goldman Sachs  \\nYes. Good morning, everybody. Firstly, on the future capital requirements, at the time of the announcement,  \\nFINMA said that a larger bank would require higher capital buffers. Have you had any further clarity on the \\nsize of that increase in capital requirement, and particularly to what extent those higher capital requirements \\nmay be influenced by t he ultimate perimeter of the group? And I suppose any thoughts you have around how \\nthose decisions will ultimately feed into the timing of future capital return decisions? That's the first question.  \\nAnd then secondly, in the report this morning, you've out lined that the Emergency Ordinance provides for the \\nloss sharing agreement with the Swiss Confederation, but that the Emergency Ordinance will expire within six \\nmonths of its issuance date, after which time those measures would need to be codified into law by the Swiss \\nparliament. Does that mean that the loss sharing guarantees still are effectively subject to parliamentary \\napproval in six months' time? And if so, what are your confidence levels in getting those approvals?  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nOkay. Thank you. On capital requirements, you know, the situation will be clearer once we determine the \\nscope and per imeter of the activities we will run, particularly in respect of non -core activities , and also with \\nthe business es that we will exit . This will, of course, have an impact on op- risk, capital charges and so on.  \\nSo, I think this is one of the issues that Sarah referred to. When we will have more clarity on all those aspects, \\nwe will communicate. But I don't expect this to be something substantial , that will take away the merits and \\nthe value accretion and creation of this transaction.  \\nIn respect of the guarantee, we have little doubt that what we have agreed with the government is \\nenforceable.  Of course, there is a process in place to define exactly the details of this guarantee, and we do \\nexpect that to be done in the next couple of months. But we are not concerned about the enforceability of \\nthe guarantee as part , as an integral part of our agreements over the weekend to step -in in this situation.  \\nChris Hallam, Goldman Sachs  \\nVery clear . Thanks.  \\nKian Abouhossein , JPMorgan  \\nYeah. Thanks. Just two questions. The first one is related to the book value per share guidance that you gave \\nof the 74% increase on day one. Just wondering if that still holds, first of all, at this point, or  has that \\nchanged post your further analysis. And in that context, should we assume that the purchase accounting, \\nrestructuring , asset marks , etcete ra, should be captured by the reserves that is being built off what we \\nestimate 21 billion.  \\nThe second question is in relation to more top down. How we should think about the impact on clients at this \\npoint and also retention of clients, especially in weal th management at this point already . And how we should \\nthink about retention of clients post  the event , the clients that have left. How should we think about your \\nposition after that?  \\n \\n Page 10 of 21 \\n Sergio P. Ermotti  \\nSo, Sarah, take the first question. I'll take the second.  \\nSarah Youngwood  \\nSo, when we give you the 74%, we focused intentionally on what we viewed as economic impact, i.e., what \\nimpacts CET1 and if you continue to do it that way, actually the numbers are very stable. Of course, we are  \\ncontinuing to do the  work on the PPA and we're going to continue to do so. And the PPA was, of course, \\nincluded in the estimates that we had given you.  \\nKian Abouhossein , JPMorgan  \\nSorry if I may. The 74% also includes  - but does clearly not include additional charges to the P&L and the rest \\ncomes to the P&L, we should assume.  \\nSarah Youngwood  \\nThat's right. The initial PPA comes into the CET1 or the tangible book value per share, and anything that is \\nbeyond that comes thro ugh the P&L.  \\nKian Abouhossein, JPMorgan  \\nOk. \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nSo on client retention, I – maybe let me reiterate that if you look at our inflows and in general, we don't have \\nan issue with our current clients. And we do believe that in many areas where we  were underweight on a \\nshare of wallet basis we will be able to convince clients that the combined organization is offering a better \\nvalue. In some areas, of course, we will lose clients because their concentration is going to be too high. And \\nlast but not  least, I do believe that while history doesn't really always repeat itself, we  are also convinced that \\nmany of the clients that were maybe nervous or concerned about what happened at Credit Suisse in the last \\nfew months but also post  the transaction will regain faith and you know, we will be able to get some of these \\nassets back.  \\nSo, I'm totally convinced that , you know,  our growth and our ability not only to retain but to regain clients \\nwill be there once we are able to articulate the value proposition that the combined organizations can bring \\nto fruits.  \\nAlastair Ryan , Bank of America  \\nYeah. Thank you. Good morning. Welcome back, Sergio. On the comments you made on the Bloomberg TV  \\ninterview earlier about the importan ce of centrality , essentiality of ongoing profitability, which was absolutely \\nborne out in recent months . Clearly the combined group has an exceptionally strong capital position on a pro \\nforma basis, which gives you the opportunity to move quite quickly in two ways, one in a sort of actual effect \\nin the merger and taking financial reserves against that. So, should we think about going quickly as essential \\nto your plans because you’ ve got the financial conditions to do it? Clearly, that was something that Credit \\n \\n Page 11 of 21 \\n Suisse did  not enjoy. They had some ambitions to restructure that they needed to pass through the P&L over \\ntime, which constrain their profitability a long way into the future. Thank you.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nThank you, Ryan. It is good to be back to interact with you as well. L ook, ye s, you know what we need to do \\nnow as we go through the PPA assessment and the marks of the position we find. You can assume that the \\nphilosophy of running down non- core assets wi ll be the same you saw in the past : based on cost of capital.  \\nSo, if we are able to dispose,  to restructure , any transaction that create a loss that is lower than the cost of \\nour capital, we will do so without any doubts , any fears of taking upfront losses. So, it's precisely so, as you \\nmentioned, that the profitability and the strength we have in our underlying business combined allows us this \\nflexibility to control our destiny.  \\nI think, it's very important not to treat those positions as distressed assets, but rather non -core assets. And, \\ntherefore, an economic consideration has to be put in place. So, every time we can do a transaction that in \\nour view reduces risk but also frees up capital below our cost of equity, we will do that.  \\nAnd, I guess, this is something that now it takes time for us to go deeper into the analysis of what it is.  But \\nthis is something I ’ like to clarify as quickly as possible what it is. So, you can assume that one of our top \\npriorities , to clarify a path of – for us to take down  these [assets] , to free up this capital going forward and \\nalso reduce risks.  \\nAlastair Ryan , Bank of America  \\nThank you.  \\nFlora Bocahut , Jefferies  \\nYes. Good morning. The first question I wanted to ask you is regarding the net new money, so the net new \\nFGA. You gave us some details  you know  including post the 10 business days that followed the \\nannouncement of the deal and thank you for that. I don't think I've seen any comment around the trend in \\nApril. So, just wanted to ask you know, what trend you've seen in terms of the customer behavior and \\nespecially regarding the NNF GA as well as customer deposits since the quarter ended about three weeks ago.  \\nAnd then I just wanted to come back to the risk around – the you know concentration risk around clients and \\nthe overlap on the client base. You made interesting comments regarding the fact that you are underweight \\ncertain client segment  versus CS , and where you can gain from that transaction. Th ere is another client \\nsegment which could lose. Can you maybe provide us more details? Do you mean in we alth management \\nspecifically, also in P&C? Can you maybe comment on those client segments? Thank you.  \\nSarah Youngwood  \\nSo, on the first question in terms of the trends of April, we really haven't seen anything that is particularly \\nabnormal or special. And s o, it is not our custom  to guide and we will stay with that.  \\n \\n \\n \\n Page 12 of 21 \\n Sergio P. Ermotti  \\nYeah. On the client side. I mean, if you look at, for example, in Asia, I think it ’s clear that UBS has that \\nperhaps a stronger franchise in North Asia and Credit Suisse h as a stronger franchise, relatively speaking, in \\nSoutheast Asia. So, I think that the combination of the two is very complementary.  \\nLatin America, I mean, in Latin Amer ica, we definitely have a situation in which Credit Suisse brings a \\nsignificant value to our platform. And there, that will make us, if not the leader of non- Latin American \\nplayers, very close to that. So, a significant step forward.  \\nIn respect of Switzerl and, I would say that usually, SMEs have a relationship with maybe one of the large \\nbank s and with a cantonal bank or a regional bank. So, it ’s – there is a high likelihood that the same SMEs \\ndon’t really have equal a relationship with the two large banks.  For that reason, we believe that many of them \\ncan be captured.  \\nSame issue for retail and personal clients banking. If people have two relationship s, usually they have it with a \\nlocal bank and with a large bank. So, also there. And last but not least, I would say, that it’ s fair to say that \\nCredit Suisse has a strong franchise in large corporates in Switzerland, which is also complementary to our \\nown.  \\nSo, after all, as I say, both in terms of current business mix, but also going back to my remarks. In Switz erland, \\nthere are 250 banks. It ’s plenty of competition, plenty of cantonal banks, plenty of Raiffeisen Banks. And, \\ntherefore, we believe that we will be able to manage this competitive landscape, which is not easy for us \\nthrough service quality and what w e can do differently than others rather than just purely size.  \\nFlora Bocahut , Jefferies  \\nThank you . \\nAndrew Coombs , Citi \\nGood morning. Two questions. Firstly, just on slide 10 in your revised net interest income outlook, Q1, you’ ve \\nseen a slight increase in NII . So then you are guiding to a mid- single digit decrease for Q2. So that implies Q2 \\nwill be slightly below the Q4 run rate. Implicitly, this seems to suggest that Q3, Q4 is roughly then going to be  \\nstable based on your full yea r guidance.  \\nSo, I’m interested in your thoughts on the offset between  rate hikes and then most important of all, deposit \\nmigration to money market funds in future quarters. Given that we ’re closing in on peak rates, it seems to \\nimply you ’re achieving , the deposit migration also slows, but would welcome any commentary on that.  \\nAnd then my second question is actually on the liquidity coverage ratio. I think there ’s an active debate as to \\nwhether it’ s calibrated correctly in light of recent events, particularly the 10% weighting that ’s applied to less \\nstable retail deposits . So, interested in any conversations you ’ve had on that either with FINMA or the Basel \\nCommittee. And likewise, does that mean you ’re going to continue to run with an LCR of, you know, north \\nof 160%, given the potential that that ratio might be recalibrated? Thank you.  \\n \\n \\n \\n Page 13 of 21 \\n Sarah Youngwood  \\nSo, on the first quarter or the first question , what you've seen is some very significant mix shift throughout \\nthe system, the $600 billion of F ed data showed that the whole system had a 3% sequential decrease that we \\nstill saw. That is not expected to be that dramatic going forward , but we certainly have planned for the \\nannualization of that in our numbers. And then after that, you se e some normal patterns that happened, but \\nwe continue to see some mix shifts, as you would expect, but potentially not at the level that was seen at the \\nbeginning of the year.  \\nIt's also important to know that for us, it was really the beginning of the year  that was that pattern. So, \\nactually January and February where we saw a lot of mix shift and actually some of the net inflows into the \\nplatforms from deposits were in March.  \\nIn terms of the second quarter guidance, you’ ve noted that we ’re going to be down and that is exactly \\ncorrect with P&C being slightly up and GWM, which is where those mix shifts are happening, being a bit \\ndown. And then as you pointed out mathematically, that does mean that there is some level of stability over \\nthe c ourse of the year thereafter.  \\nIn terms of LCR, we believe that we are calibrated correctly because what you are seeing also is that for us, \\nthe changes in deposits have actually not done very much in terms of the change of LCR because we very \\nmuch know wha t type of deposits are going to be sticky versus not sticky. And so, we calculate as such. And \\nof course, you've seen us very consistently being at those high levels and we don't have an intention to drop \\nsharply regardless of the dialogue that could happe n around the LCR calculations.  \\nAndrew Coombs, Citi  \\nThank you . \\nAdam Ter elak, Mediobanca  \\nMorning. I've got two. One is a bit of a follow up on LCR and on your long- term funding strategy. Clearly, \\nLCR standalone is pretty strong. If you look at the business y ou're acquiring, then it's really propped up by a \\nbig SNB liquidity line  and that deposits are very, very low. Loans to deposit is 157%. So, I was just wondering \\nhow you're thinking about your long- term funding strategy through the acquisition and how you might deal \\nwith kind of the flight of deposits that they  have seen and how y ou can integrate that into your liquidity \\nmodel going forward.  \\nAnd then second on a slightly different topic. In GWM, you've got flat costs  on lower revenues, and a \\nfavorable revenue mix with NII up and fees down. Normally, that is a good mix for your cost  base. Could you \\njust discuss a little bit more what's going on in there, what sort of inflation you're seeing, whether there is a n \\nincreased competition for relationship managers, and whether that's changing given the new environment? \\nThank you.  \\nSarah You ngwood \\nSo on the LCR and more generally the funding plan, as we integrate CS today they are user of the SN B \\nfacilities. It will be our intention certainly to manage that down as quickly as possible, b ut recognizing the gap \\nthat you're pointing out. And we will indicate that as soon as ready.  \\n \\n Page 14 of 21 \\n In terms of the GWM story, what you're seeing is, as noted, a very strong NII performance. In  asset based , it is \\nthe combination of the markets levels as well as a little bit of the margin compression that has happen ed over \\nthe year, which is just a mix topic that we have discussed.  \\nAnd then in terms of the transaction activity, not yet very elevated, just based on the level of uncertainty that \\nour clients are dealing with. And then what you have seen, though, is on t he expense side that we have good \\nrigor where the expense ex -FX and litigation is flat. And so you are offsetting those inflationary pressures by \\nthe good rigor that we are seeing and this is while  continuing to be on the offense in terms of our FA \\nrecruitment and organic growth.  \\nAdam Ter elak, Mediobanca  \\nOkay. So the inflationary pressure, that sounds quite high to be managed down.  \\nSarah Youngwood  \\nThat's right it's being managed by the offset. And we've done some actions which I've mentioned which in \\ntotal are helping us more on the forward quarter than in the current quarter and also affecting the quarter and are still included in our cost being flat. So, really a good performance.  \\nAdam Ter elak, Mediobanca  \\nThank you.  \\nJeremy Sigee, Exane  \\nMorning. Thank  you and welcome back to Sergio from me as well. I just want to pick up on a couple of topics \\nthat you've touched on already. Firstly, you talked about the Swiss banks combined market share. I wanted to \\nclarify, is your plan to fully integrate the two netw orks under a single brand, single product range, single \\nnetwork, back office, head office?  \\nAnd then secondly, you also touched on the risk shelter. If I read the documents, it seems narrowly defined so \\nthat it won't cover things like litigation, restructuring, or indeed the operating costs of noncore , only asset \\ndisposal losses. So, it seems relatively unlikely to be drawn. So, I just wanted to ask, is it  your base case that \\nyou will draw on that risk shelter or that you  also agree it's unlikely t hat you will draw on that risk shelter.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nThank you, Jeremy. Look, you know, the base plan that we announced on day one when we announced the \\ntransaction was, of course, the full integration. But we reiterated afterwards, and I said  it also  before that we \\nare now evaluating what is the best option for the combined businesses going forward. I personally and we believe also that there is no – there is no real issue in terms of oversized presence in Switzerland or market \\nshare topics. I mean, f or the reason I mentioned before, we may have to balance what is the best things to do \\nfrom a shareholder standpoint  of view with o ther aspects.  We will take , in serious consideration , what is the \\nbest interest of clients? What is the best interest of employees and overall for society?  \\nHaving said that, what we need to do is also to make those decisions  based on facts and not emotions. Right \\nnow, the discussion is totally based on emotions. In many cases, totally uninformed. And we need ourselves to understand better those issues before we come to a conclusion. And it's very important not to jump in to \\n \\n Page 15 of 21 \\n any conclusion. Whatever we do has to be sustainable and viable. And therefore, it takes a little bit of time, \\nbut it won't take forever. We know that both  employees, clients and, in general, you as well, you want to \\nhave and we want to have as quickly as possible clarity on what to do. So be patient and in the next few \\nmonths we will create more clarity on the matter.  \\nIn terms of risks, of course, you're ri ght. I mean, first of all, we have to realize that any losses that are coming \\noutside the non- core units are part – will be absorbed by UBS . So, the only item that is subject to the \\nguarantee is the non- core unit and the first 5 billion of losses coming from that unit is on UBS. So, we have \\nalmost by default an interest to be prudent in the way we mark this position , and sustainable in the way we \\nlook at how we disposed those positions. But at the same time, we are also the ones , you know,  that want to \\npreserve value for our shareholders.  \\nSo, we will avoid – we will try to avoid at any cost having to tap into the guarantees. But at this stage, it's \\npremature to discuss if we have to do it, when we have to do it. This is also a matter that needs to be closed \\nas quickly as possible in terms of creating clarity. So, the next couple of months there will also be very \\nimportant for us to fully understand the exposures and I'm convinced that this can be done in the timeframe \\nthat I just outlined.  \\nJeremy Sigee, Exane  \\nGreat, thank you  very much . \\nAnke Reingen , RBC \\nYeah. Thank you very much for taking my question. The first is just about the mechanics as you pay with the  \\ntreasury share s if there's a difference versus, yeah, new share issuance  just, yeah, conceptually and in terms of \\nthe impact.  \\nAnd then secondly, just a different question on your commercial real estate exposure. Can you give us a bit \\nmore detail on the regional mix , potentially maturity profile, LTV and so on? Thank you very much.  \\nSarah Yo ungwood  \\nSo on the treasury share, what happened is we actually repurchased some of the shares and they are \\navailable. They could have been cancelled and what we're doing is we are using them for the purpose of this \\nacquisition. So, we are not issuing any new share s. \\nAnd so in terms of commercial real estate, we have a very conservative portfolio that is – that has exposure to \\nSwitzerland in particular. But – and all of that is according to what you see from us, it was the high \\ncollateralization that you would expec t. And when we give you all of our levels of reserves, we certainly \\nreflect on the very high quality of those portfolio.  \\nAnke Reingen , RBC \\nOkay. Thank you.  \\n \\n \\n \\n Page 16 of 21 \\n Amit Goel , Barclays  \\nHi. Thank you and welcome back, Sergio, too from me. So, two questions. The first, again, just on the \\ntransaction and the announcement on – on day one, I just wanted to check in terms of the cost savings and \\nthe timeline for EPS accretion whether or not your conviction levels have changed based on the information \\nthat you have had or seen since then.  \\nAnd then secondly, I was a bit surprised by the amount of, I guess, deposit outflow on a reported basis for \\nGWM in the quarter. Do you mind just going through that just going through that in a bit more detail? You know, because obviously that's net of the inflows that we're seeing towards the end of the quarter. So, I \\nappreciate there was a bit of a shift in mix and so forth. But if you could give a bit more color, that would be helpful. Thank you.  \\nSarah Youngwoo d \\nSure. So, in terms of the cost savings and EPS, the assumptions that we gave you stand. And what is \\nimportant is for the EPS accretion  to remember that we gave you what were the reported numbers. So, we \\nare not excluding non- core, we're not excluding restructurin g charge. And given that we're dealing with non-\\ncore assets that could have a timeline, it could be that some of that comes over time, which is why we gave \\nourselves until 2027.  Certainly the core EPS question in our models was faster than that.  \\nAnd then in terms of the deposit outflows for GWM, it is really very much the client repositioning that you are \\nseeing at the beginning of the year. And so, people came in and even with our advisors actually really  looked \\nat their portfolios and especially in the U .S., and you've seen that phenomenon , as I mentioned, our deposit \\nsequential decrease is exactly the same one as the Fed data.  \\nAnd as a result of people really looking at the difference in particular between what you can have on an after  \\ntax basis, between the Treasury bonds or money markets versus any savings products. So, our products are very attractive, but nevertheless, the Treasury bonds and money markets end up being more attractive. And \\ntherefore there have been mix shifts that ar e very, very logical for that type of client ele. And it is absolutely \\nthe right advice for client s that is really the majority of the driver and then it's offset by the inflows that we \\nhave gotten since we were a port  in the storm during the period of Marc h after things became a bit more \\ndifficult for others.  \\nAmit Goel , Barclays  \\nOkay. Thanks. And just on the cost savings, is that kind of, I guess, conditional on what the outcome is for the Swiss business? And  is the conviction still there on the  greater than 8 billion?  \\nSarah Youngwood  \\nSo, the 8 billion- dollars -plus was done based on the base case and, of course, anything beyond that would be \\ndone in the context of what Sergio said and  value creation.  \\nAmit Goel , Barclays  \\nOkay. Thank you.  \\n \\n \\n Page 17 of 21 \\n Benjamin Goy ; Deutsche Bank  \\nYes. Hi. Good morning. Two questions, please. The first is  you reiterated the 25% of the new group going  \\nforward with the investment bank, but if I combined UBS and Credit Suisse as of Q1 , I am already at that  \\nnumber before fully transferring the current products and so on? So, does it mean you're already happy with \\nthe perimeter of the group and potentially happy to diversify your fixed income business via their credit sales \\nand trading? Or is this number ultim ately going lower towards maybe 20% or whatever the number is?  \\nAnd then, secondly, wondering about global wealth management. Do you re -underwrite the Credit Suisse \\nclient from a risk perspective? i .e., is there  a new onboarding process or do they just join as of…the deal  \\ncompleting? Thank you.  \\nSergio Ermotti  \\nWell, on the 25%, I mean, it depends how you make the calculation. But you know directionally, what we are \\nsaying is that the 25% on a normalized basis will be the maximum. And from there onwards, we wi ll look \\ninto what fits into our risk profile. There are many, many areas where Credit Suisse will bring new capabilities \\nthat are good and enhancing our franchise in the investment bank. So we are not concerned about those \\nactivities. And as you know, there is also some kind of correlation with risk -weighted assets being a function \\nof market movements and volatility. So we can't really right now point out  a normalized number that we are \\nhappy with other than saying 25% will be the maximum and no matter what. So that's a good starting point.  \\nI think that if you look at the combined organization, we will reduce the weighting of …, going forward. And \\nmost importantly, we have a more diversified business. So th is is also one of th ese items where we need a \\nlittle bit of more digging into the business and what is going to stay with us and what is not going to be part \\nof our offering.  \\nThe onboarding will be done in a pragmatic way. Unless we have red flags, we will onboard clients. And we want to make the journey and the experience of clients as smooth as possible. But of course, the operating \\nmodel in principle is the one of UBS. So then , as we then on board clients, we will then look at the suitability \\nand making sure that they fit into our standards. I d on't expect major differences, but here and there, we may \\nhave different views on certain client segments or people.  \\nBenjamin Goy; Deutsche Bank  \\nUnderstood. Thank you.  \\nTom Hallet , KBW  \\nGood morning, everyone. So, just a couple for me. So, I mean first of  all, how concerned are you around the \\nrevenue attrition already taking place at Credit Suisse? You know I guess where I'm coming from is based on \\nthe current revenue trajectory , the 8 billion of cost reductions might not actually be enough. So, could we be \\nin a situation where a deeper restructuring is required.  \\nAnd then maybe secondly, around buybacks. I mean, part of the issue there is people are trying to time it and obviously, work out the capital and so forth. I suppose that you got one side, you got the government \\nguarantees and then on the other, you've got a very politically sensitive situation.  \\n \\n Page 18 of 21 \\n And I suppose regardless of your capital position, is it fair to assume that buybacks are very much kind of at \\nthe back of mind for now and we're talking 18 plus months away before you can even consider that between \\nthe link between obviously your strong capital position – expected capital position and the government \\nguarantees.  \\nThanks.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nThank you, Tom. Now, look, of course, the revenue attrition is a function of what happened in the last couple of months. And also, if you look at the – the profitability is highly impacted by the cost of funding they had \\nexperience d in the last few months. I think that once things are together and  normalized, we will also create \\nsome tailwinds in respect of lower cost of funding and an ability to re -attract clients.  \\nI'm convinced that a lot of the clients will see the value added of the combined businesses and some of those \\nflows will revert. So, o f course, we are at the same time, not complacent. So, if we see that this is not \\nenough , we will need to take actions. And, of course, we want to, at the very least, bring back the \\nprofitability ambitions that we had as a UBS standalone with one of the combined entities. So, cost – focus on \\nefficiency on costs and capital returns and value creation is part of the equation, and we will do the necessary \\nsteps to do that.  \\nLook, in terms of buyback, it's way too premature to talk about it. You know, assuming  that it takes 18 \\nmonths for clarity, it's a guess that I – you know, I fully understand your point, but believe me, we don't \\nknow yet ourselves. So – but we will give you clarity as soon as we have clarity on this matter. We need to be \\nsensitive to many a spects. But I'm also convinced that it won't take quarters or years to create that clarity. So, \\nthe trajectory of freeing up resources, of creating clarity around the guarantees, creating clarity around the \\nbusiness model and our capacity to combine, you k now, a dividend policy that sees a constant improvement \\nin the cash we pay out combined with share buyback is an important element of our equity story, and we will \\nbe very focused on that in our communication.  \\nTom Hallet, KBW  \\nGreat.  Thanks,  Sergio.  \\nNichola s Payen , Kepler C heuvreux  \\nYes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have two. The first one is for you, Sergio. I would like to know if you had noticed anything which was radically different at UBS and its processes, organization, or \\nanything between your departure in 2020 and today? And the second question is regarding Americas and GWM. There was quite a significant drop in advisors, and I would like to know if there was any underlying \\nreason for this drop. Thank you.  \\nSergio P. Ermott i \\nThank you, Nicolas. No. To be honest, it felt [like] I never left. So I think that  you don't see any meaningful \\nchange. Of course, some things , like is normal, they should change. They should have changed. Not \\neverything I left was perfect, so things nee ded to be addressed. And other things are very personal and then \\nvery – a question of style. But, I mean, the strength of the franchise was only reinforced over the last two \\n \\n Page 19 of 21 \\n years and this is the reason why we were able to be part of the solution over the weekend, so – which is a \\nhuge achievement for UBS.  \\nEven if – when you go back into where we were during the financial crisis, in my point of view, this was the \\nultimate  payback  to Switzerland.  The fact that UBS was part of the  solution was the ultimate  payback  on what \\nthe government had to do. And we were always very thankful for that. And so, in that sense, nothing has \\nchanged , if anything has been reinforced. And Sarah?  \\nSarah Youngwood  \\nOn GWM, you actually  have a technicality,  which  is that we put in our FA’s at both the very high end of FA’s, \\nbut also the people that are in that client advice center, and so it came really  mostly  from the client advice \\ncenter. And so really focusing on the flows and the productivity of the FA’s  is where we are and we are not \\nseeing an issue here . In fact, you have seen the very good flows that we have experienced in the U .S. this \\nquarter.  \\nNicholas Payen  \\nThank you. \\nAndrew Lim, S ociété Générale \\nHi. Good morning. And welcome  back, Sergio, from me as well. So, my first question is on NII. Appreciate the \\nmore integrated disclosure on the be ta and the migration. I was wondering if you could talk more specifically \\nabout how that plays out on a geographical basis. Is that the greater pressure on the beta migration mainly \\nfrom the U .S. side or are we seeing any changes in Europe and Asia as well? And maybe you can give some \\ncolor on how your NII should pan out based on forward curves into 2024.  \\nAnd then my next question is on the IB. Appreciate you've yet to outline the p erimeter  of what mean – of \\nwhat goes into non- core. But at the same time, you've been very specific about your IB DNA for the past few \\nyears now. And so, there's a question mark over the lev fin business which CS  lumps with IBD. I guess the \\nquestion is how do you see that business within your IB structure?  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nOkay. Thank you, Andrew. I'll take the second question. I think that, yes, the DNA won't change  what we do \\nis part of the equation and having a diversified portfolio of bus inesses does include also having leverage \\nfinance. Of course, we are – we will stay very focused on how we are present in that business. We want to be \\nmeaningful to our clients, but also to be mindful that you know, this cannot be the driver of the profita bility \\nof the investment bank with all associated, you know, volatility and risks. So, you can count on us , or our \\nclients can count on us being a relevant player, but definitely, we are not – our ambition is not to be at the \\ntop of the league just for – and to make it a central part of our model.  \\nSo, expect at the margins a little bit more, but in a very, very focused way. And we will also look at ways to \\nbe creative around that business, because there are opportunities for us to also partner with other in stitutions \\non how to manage,  you know  residual risk. So, our ability has to be to be the bridge in the investment bank \\nbetween different sources of capital and not necessarily originate and store risks.  \\n \\n \\n Page 20 of 21 \\n Sarah Youngwood  \\nIn terms of the NII, so, looking at it by region and really by currency is how we think about it. What you have, \\nfirst of all, as a broad statement is that for each product category in each region and the realized beta at or \\nbelow the mode lled beta. But th en what you have is you have mix shifts within the deposit products which \\nare yielding those  higher overall , on basically repricing. And what we are seeing is then based on where we \\nare in the cycle.   \\nSo in the U .S., where those very high rates where we ar e at very high incremental betas. And that's \\ncontinuing with the mix shift that I've discussed in the best interest of the clients. And then you have in \\nEurope, we went from being really at fairly low levels to  – now moving into a place where there is price \\nsensitivity, especially for GW M clients. So, you have seen an increase, which is totally planned, but a little bit \\nof mix shift also there, but a bit less on the mix  shift there. And then on – in Switzerland, you've got a mix \\nwhere you've got the P&C , especially i n Personal Banking where you still have a very low level of rates in all of \\nSwitzerland. And we have put in place appropriate levels of pricing actions, but yet have – or are still in that \\nplace in the cycle where you are seeing less of a shi ft or repricing just based on where the currencies are. So, \\ngoing into the next year, you're continuing to go higher for all of the currencies and 2024,  really, it will \\ndepend on the r ate path.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti –  closing remarks  \\nOkay. Looks like there are no more questions. Thank you for being with us this morning. As I sa id, despite the \\nvery uncertain market conditions, we delivered solid underlying results for the quarter. We have been \\nmaintaining our capital and liquidity positions, and we were also able to get very close to resolve a legacy matter that has been with us fo r 15 years.  \\nWe discussed also the unique opportunity that the acquisition of Credit Suisse presents not only for our shareholders, but I believe also for all the rest of our stakeholders , employees, clients, society at large. And of \\ncourse, this is not go ing to be a straight line journey. You know, it's going to be a challenging one, is a \\ncomplex one. But I do believe that, you know, the benefits outweigh by far , all those factors.  \\nSo, I know that you are looking for more details. We are also you are looking for more details. And we will \\nreally do our best to keep the communication channels open over the next few weeks and months so that we \\ncan provide the necessary information to have a better understanding of this great equity story ahead of us.  \\nThank yo u. \\n \\n \\n Page 21 of 21 \\n Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward -Looking Statements |  This document contains statements that constitute “forward -looking statements,” \\nincluding but not limited to management’s outlook for UBS’s financial performance, statements relating to the an ticipated effect of transactions and \\nstrategic initiatives on UBS’s business and future development and goals or intentions to achieve climate, sustainability and  other social objectives. While \\nthese forward-looking statements represent UBS’s judgments, ex pectations and objectives concerning the matters described, a number of risks, uncertainties \\nand other important factors could cause actual developments and results to differ materially from UBS’s expectations. The Russia –Ukraine war has led to \\nheightened volatility across global markets, exacerbated global inflation, and slowed global growth. In addition, the war has caused significant population \\ndisplacement, and if the conflict continues  or escalates, the scale of disruption will increase and continue to  cause  shortages of vital commodities, including \\nenergy shortages and food insecurity, and may lead to recessions in OECD economies. The  coordinated sanctions on Russia and Belarus, and Russian and \\nBelarusian entities and nationals, and the uncertainty as to whether the war will widen and intensify , may have significant adverse effects on the market \\nand macroeconomic conditions, including in ways that cannot be anticipated. This creates significantly greater uncertainty ab out forward -looking \\nstatements. In addition, turmoil in the banking industry has increased and, at the urging of Swiss authorities, UBS has announced historic p lans to merge \\nwith another global systemically important bank in Switzerland. The transaction creates considerable integration risk . Other factors that may affect our \\nperformance and ability to achieve our plans, outlook and other objectives also include, but are not limited to: (i)  the degree to which UBS is successful in \\nthe ongoing execution of its strategic plans, including its co st reduction and efficiency initiatives and its ability to manage its levels of risk -weighted assets \\n(RWA) and leverage ratio denominator (LRD), liquidity coverage ratio and other financial resources, including changes in RWA assets and liabilities arising  \\nfrom higher market volatility; (ii)  the degree to which UBS is successful in implementing changes to its businesses to meet changing market, regulatory and \\nother conditions; (iii)  increased inflation and interest rate volatility in major markets; (iv)  developments in the macroeconomic climate and in the markets in \\nwhich UBS operates or to which it is exposed, including movements in securities prices or liquidity, credit spreads, currency  exchange rates, deterioration or \\nslow recovery in residential and com mercial real estate markets, the effects of economic conditions, including increasing inflationary pressures, market \\ndevelopments, increasing geopolitical tensions, and changes to national trade policies on the financial position or creditwor thiness of UBS ’s clients and \\ncounterparties, as well as on client sentiment and levels of activity, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to manage it, which have \\nhad and may also continue to have a significant adverse effect on global and regional econ omic activity, including disruptions to global supply chains and \\nlabor market displacements; (v) changes in the availability of capital and funding, including any adverse changes in UBS’s credit spreads and credit ratings \\nof UBS, Credit Suisse, sovereign issuers, structured credit products or credit -related exposures , as well as availability and cost of funding to meet requirements \\nfor debt eligible for total loss -absorbing capacity (TLAC); (vi) changes in central bank policies or the implementation of financial legislation and regulation \\nin Switzerland, the US, the UK, the European Union and other financial centers that have imposed, or resulted in, or may do so in the future, more stringent or entity- specific capital, TLA C, leverage ratio, net stable funding ratio, liquidity and funding requirements, heightened operational resilience requiremen ts, \\nincremental tax requirements, additional levies, limitations on permitted activities, constraints on remuneration, constraint s on transfers of capital and \\nliquidity and sharing of operational costs across the Group or other measures, and the effect these will or would have on UBS ’s business activities; (vii)  UBS’s \\nability to successfully implement resolvability and related regulat ory requirements and the potential need to make further changes to the legal structure or \\nbooking model of UBS in response to legal and regulatory requirements, or other developments; (viii)  UBS’s ability to maintain and improve its systems and \\ncontrols fo r complying with sanctions in a timely manner and for the detection and prevention of money laundering to meet evolving regul atory \\nrequirements and expectations, in particular in current geopolitical turmoil; (ix)  the uncertainty arising from domestic stre sses in certain major economies; \\n(x) changes in UBS’s competitive position, including whether differences in regulatory capital and other requirements among the major financial centers \\nadversely affect UBS’s ability to compete in certain lines of business;  (xi) changes in the standards of conduct applicable to our businesses that may result \\nfrom new regulations or new enforcement of existing standards, including measures to impose new and enhanced duties when inte racting with customers \\nand in the execution and handling of customer transactions; (xii)  the liability to which UBS may be exposed, or possible constraints or sanctions that \\nregulatory authorities might impose on UBS, due to litigation, contractual claims and regulatory investigations, including th e potential for disqualification \\nfrom certain businesses, potentially large fines or monetary penalties, or the loss of licenses or privileges as a result of regulatory or other governmental sanctions, as well as the effect that litigation, regulatory and s imilar matters have on the operational risk component of our RWA, as well as the amount of \\ncapital available for return to shareholders; (xiii)  the effects on UBS’s business, in particular cross -border banking, of sanctions, tax or regulatory \\ndevelopments and of possible changes in UBS’s policies and practices; (xiv) UBS’s ability to retain and attract the employees necessary to generate revenues \\nand to manage, support and control its businesses, which may be affected by competitive factors; (xv) changes in accounting or tax standards or policies, \\nand determinations or interpretations affecting the recognition of gain or loss, the valuation of goodwill, the recognition o f deferred tax assets and other \\nmatters; (xvi)  UBS’s ability to implement new technologie s and business methods, including digital services and technologies, and ability to successfully \\ncompete with both existing and new financial service providers, some of which may not be regulated to the same extent; (xvii)  limitations on the effectiveness \\nof UBS’s internal processes for risk management, risk control, measurement and modeling, and of financial models generally; ( xviii) the occurrence of \\noperational failures, such as fraud, misconduct, unauthorized trading, financial crime, cyberattacks, data  leakage and systems failures, the risk of which is \\nincreased with cyberattack threats from nation states; (xix)  restrictions on the ability of UBS Group AG to make payments or distributions, including due to \\nrestrictions on the ability of its subsidiaries  to make loans or distributions, directly or indirectly, or, in the case of financial difficulties, due to the exercise by \\nFINMA or the regulators of UBS’s operations in other countries of their broad statutory powers in relation to protective meas ures, re structuring and \\nliquidation proceedings;

Ermotti  \\n \\nSlide 3 – K ey messages  \\n \\nThank you, Sarah and good morning, everyone.  \\n2023 was a defining year for UBS as we acquired Credit Suisse in one of the largest transactions in banking \\nhistory, setting a new long -term trajectory for our franchise.  It was also an intense year that required exceptional \\nfocus from all of our colleagues during periods of significant change and uncertainty.  We stayed close to our \\nclients, helping them manage a rapidly evolving geopolitical and macroeconomic backdrop, as well as the turmoil that occurred in the financial system last March.  The strength and stability  of UBS provides is a direct \\nresult of our decade -long sustainabl e strategy, an unwavering commitment to maintaining a balance sheet for \\nall seasons, and a focus on risk and capital efficiency.  \\nFor these reasons, clients reward UBS with their extended trust and confidence during periods of volatility and \\nmarket uncertainty.  And it allowed UBS to credibly step in and stabilize the Swiss, and wider, financial system \\nby taking over Credit Suisse.  We have acquired an enterprise that has suffered from many years of unsustainable \\ncapital allocation and under -investment in its businesses and control framework.  This resulted in cost and capital \\ninefficiencies, significant losses and, ultimately, substantial franchise erosion.  However, the acquisition \\naccelerates our strategic priorities by providing UBS with a complementary client base, stronger regional \\npresence, more products and services, as well as many talented people. This gives us great confidence in our \\nability to meet our ambitions and deliver long- term growth and consistently higher returns.  \\nSlide 4 – Stabilized Credit Suisse franchise and delivered on 2023 financial priorities  \\nWe made great progress on our plans in 2023.  We successfully won back, retained and grew client assets while \\nbeginning the restructuring phase.  We have also substantially reduced funding costs and run down non- core \\nbooks.  In our first full quarter as a combined firm, we stabilized Credit Suisse’s client franchises and achieved \\nunderlying profitability.  This permitted us to pay down the extraordinary liquidity support and voluntarily \\n \\n Page 2 of 32 \\n terminate the loss- protection agreement guaranteed by the Swiss government.  We also provided important \\nclarity for all of our stakeholders as we finalized our target operating model.  Notably, we established the \\nperimeter for Non -Core and Legacy and moved forward with fully integrating our Swiss domestic operations.  \\nOur progress continued in the fourth quarter.  We maintained momentum with our clients, with 22 billion in \\nnet new assets in GWM, bringing our total to 77 billion since the closing of the acquisition.  In the quarter, we \\nalso cut another 1 billion in exit -rate gross costs as we move forward on our restructuring plans.  Nearly 80% \\nof Non Core and Legacy’s 12 billion decline in risk weighted assets in the second half was driven by our active \\nwind -down s.  \\nWe achieved all of this while maintaining our capital strength.  Our CET1 capital ratio increased to 14.5%, \\nhelping us to build capacity for higher capital returns while, at the same time, preparing to absorb integration charges and tax inefficiencies.  A great -  and often overlooked -  measure of the Group’s resilience and self -\\nsufficiency is our total loss- absorbing capacity, which now stands at 200 billion. Given the ongoing debate \\nfollowing the events of last March, this is particularly relevant to me.  \\nLastly, let me highlight some  things  I am especially proud of, and which I believe is the essential driver of what \\nwill make this successful journey  a great story . Our people have embraced both our culture and the opportunity \\nahead while collaborating on the integration.  This will allow us to continue to serve clients and fulfil our growth \\ninitiatives.  Before I take you through our plans for the next phase of the acquisition, I will hand off to Todd to \\ncover our fourth -quarter results.   \\n  \\n \\n Page 3 of 32 \\n Todd Tuckner  \\n \\nSlide 5 – 4Q23 underlying PBT of 0.6bn  \\nThank you Sergio and good morning, everyone.  \\nYou’ll recall that with our third quarter earnings, we introduced underlying performance metrics that strip out \\nitems that we don’t consider to be representative of underlying performance - primarily pull -to-par effects from \\nthe purchase price allocation process and integration -related expenses.  In this respect, when assessing the \\nprogress we are making in our underlying performance, it is important to remember that our underlying operating expense baseline is the combination of the cost stacks of two globa lly, systemically important banks, \\nsuch that our underlying costs in absolute terms remain elevated, and will for some time.  This quarter, our \\nunderlying performance also excludes a material loss relating to our ownership interest in SIX Group.   \\nIn my remarks, I will refer to these underlying numbers in US dollars and compare them to our performance last \\nquarter, unless stated otherwise.  \\nStarting with the P&L on slide 6 [edit: 5]. PBT in the fourth quarter was 592 million, a decrease of 322 million \\nfrom the third quarter, mainly driven by lower client activity and billable invested assets, as well as the UK bank \\nlevy and a US FDIC special assessment relating to last year’s US bank  closures.  Credit loss expenses were 136 \\nmillion this quarter, mainly relating to P&C and the IB.  \\nOn a reported basis, the fourth quarter net loss was 279 million, including a net tax benefit of 473 million, primarily resulting from a revaluation of our deferred tax assets as we completed our business planning process.  \\nAs we continue to execute on our integration plans at pace and benefit from seasonally higher client activity, we expect substantial improvement in our first quarter reported net profit as compared to 4Q23.  \\nSlide 6 – 4Q23 underlying total revenues 10.4bn, down 3% QoQ  \\nMoving to revenues on slide 6.  Group revenues decreased by 3% sequentially to 10.4 billion, driven by lower \\nrecurring and net management fees on a reduced, average invested asset base, lower fair value and exit gains in Non- Core and Legacy, as well as decreased transaction -based revenues across the divisions.  \\nTotal reported revenues reached 10.9 billion, which included 944 million from pull -to-par and related effects in \\nour core businesses.  As mentioned, we also marked down our investment in SIX by 508 million to reflect the \\nlower valuation of SIX’s stake in Worldline as well as SIX’s goodwill impairment relating to its ownership of the \\nSpanish stock exchange.  \\nSlide 7 – 4Q23 underlying operating expenses 9.7bn, up 1% QoQ  \\nMoving to slide 7. Operating expenses for the Group increased to 9.7 billion, up 1%.  Our combined workforce \\nwas reduced by around 4 thousand in the quarter, bringing year -to-date reductions to 17 thousand, or down \\n11% versus the workforce of both banks at the end of 2022.  These reductions contributed to our achievement \\nof around 4 billion in gross run- rate cost saves exiting 2023 when compared to the 2022 baseline.  \\nIntegration -related expenses were 1.8 billion, of which 794 million were personnel -related, including a pension \\nbenefit equalization charge of 245 million, and 604 million from real -estate and technology asset expenses.  \\nThe pension charge did not affect CET1 capital as we recorded an offsetting gain in OCI.  On a reported basis, \\nincluding integration- related expenses, opex was 11.5 billion.   \\n \\n Page 4 of 32 \\n Slide 8 – Global Wealth Management  \\nTurning to the performance in our businesses, beginning with Global Wealth Management on slide 8.  As \\nmentioned last quarter, to align with peers, we now report net new money, plus dividends and interest, under \\nthe label of net new assets. We will also continue to disclose net new fee- generating assets, now for the \\ncombined franchise.  \\nWe saw continued momentum in flows with 22 billion in net new assets, with particularly strong performance \\nin APAC and the Americas.  We also attracted 16 billion of net new deposits, with net inflows across both the \\nUBS and Credit Suisse platforms, and including deposit inflows in the Americas for the first time since 2021.  \\nDespite the significant outflows at Credit Suisse in the first half of 2023, we generated around 54 billion of net new assets across the platforms for the full year, as we stabilized Cre dit Suisse and grew our combined \\nfranchise.  \\nMoving on to GWM’s P&L, profit before tax was 778 million, down 31% sequentially, driven by lower revenues and higher operating expenses.  Credit provisions were a 7 million release in the quarter.  \\nRevenues of 5.4 billion were 3% lower with decreases in NII and recurring fees, and with transactional revenues overall impacted by lower client activity, but nonetheless strong on the UBS platform, up 10% year -over-year. \\nNet interest income was down 2%, reflecting tapering deposit mix effects in the US, and ongoing deleveraging, partially offset by stronger deposit revenues on higher volumes.  Recurring fees were down 2%, reflecting a \\nlower average billing base.  \\nOperating expenses increased 5% to 4.6 billion, mainly due to the FDIC special assessment, litigation provisions and higher marketing and branding costs.  Important to note is that we continue to see progress in taking down \\ncosts across GWM where we are integrating Credit Suisse. Specifically, in the parts of our wealth business \\noutside the US, underlying operating expenses ex litigation and FX ticked down in the quarter and have dropped 8% compared to 2Q23 on an exit rate basis.  In the US, where a year -over-year comparison is more relevant, \\ncosts were down 2% ex financial advisor compensation, the FDIC assessment and litigation.   \\nSlide 9 – Personal & Corporate Banking (CHF)  \\nTurning to Personal & Corporate Banking on slide 9.  In its first full quarter since the announcement of the Swiss \\ndecision at the end of August, P&C generated a pre -tax profit of 794 million Swiss francs, up 3%, with lower \\nrevenues more than offset by lower operating expenses and credit charges.  As I highlighted last quarter in \\nconnection with September trends, the focus on win- back and coverage alignment across both Swiss platforms \\ncontinues to contribute to strong financial performance for P&C, including over 7 billion of net new deposit \\ninflows in the fourth quarter and revenue resiliency.  \\nNet interest income was down 1%, as the benefits from deposit inflows and higher rates were slightly more than offset by the effects of lower loan volumes and clients shifting deposits into higher -yielding products.  We \\nexpect NII for P&C and GWM combined, and in US dollar terms, to be roughly flat sequentially in the first \\nquarter, with higher rates broadly offsetting the residual effects of deposit mix shifts and the initial impact of \\nfinancial resource optimization,  which Sergio and I will cover in greate r detail shortly.  Non- NII revenues in P&C \\ndeclined by 11%, mostly driven by transaction- based income, including lower client activity, particularly in \\nCorporate and Institutional Clients.  \\nCredit loss expenses in the quarter were 72 million Swiss francs, mainly related to defaults across several names \\non the Credit Suisse platform, and from aligning provisioning approaches pertaining to Credit Suisse’s watchlist \\n \\n Page 5 of 32 \\n credits. I would also note that PPA adjustments have reduced the level of CLE this quarter.  While we have now \\nsubstantially aligned provisions and methodologies across both books, we could see a continuation of the \\nelevated levels of CLE in P&C for the foreseeable future given Credit Suisse’s higher historical credit risk profile and the current economic environment.  Opex dropped by 5% on lower personnel and real estate expenses.   \\nSlide 10 – Asset Management \\nMoving to slide 10.  Underlying PBT in Asset Management increased 16% to 180 million on seasonally higher \\nperformance fees and from gains on disposals that closed in the quarter, notably our joint venture in South Korea. Net management fees were down slightly on lower average invested assets in the quarter. Opex \\nincreased 4% to 625 million, mainly from higher personnel expenses and litigation charges.   \\nNet new money in the quarter was negative 12 billion, predominantly from two large outflows in indexed \\nequities, while we continue to see client demand for SMA and Private Markets capabilities.   \\nSlide 11 – Investment Bank  \\nTurning to the Investment Bank on slide 11.  As we said last quarter, since the IB has taken on only select parts \\nof Credit Suisse’s investment bank, we continue to consider year- over-year comparisons to be instructive in \\ndescribing the performance of the business, in particular regarding revenues. The operating loss of 280 million \\nprimarily reflects 34% higher costs, mainly personnel and technology related, while revenues from onboarded Credit Suisse staff are only beginning to build.   \\nUnderlying revenues, not including 277 million of pull -to-par accretion and other effects, increased 11% year -\\nover-year to 1.9 billion.  Global Banking revenues increased 69% with fee -pool outperformance across key \\nproducts and across all regions and particular strength in leveraged and debt capital markets, as well as strong performance in the Americas.  Global Markets revenues were down 4%, reflecting declines in Rates and FX, \\nmore than offsetting growth in equity derivatives, cash equities and financing, the latter of which topped off \\nits best full year on record.  I should highlight that cash equities gained global market share over the course of \\n2023.  \\nDuring the fourth quarter we completed the Credit Suisse banking team integration, which is already showing \\nin our M&A pipeline.  Similarly, for Markets, we expect to substantially complete onboarding of the team and \\nthe majority of its trading positions to UBS infrastructure by the end of 1Q.  With improving market activity, a \\ngrowing banking pipeline and advanced progress on integration, we expect the IB to return to profitability in the first quarter. \\nSlide 12 – Non- core and Legacy  \\nMoving to Non- Core and Legacy on Slide 12.  Underlying PBT was negative 977 million.  In the quarter we \\nreduced RWA by 6 billion, with three quarters of the decrease from active wind -down.  LRD dropped by \\n19 billion, and is down one -third since 2Q23.  \\nRevenues were 162 million in the quarter. As in 3Q, on average we exited positions at or above our marks.  \\nCredit loss expenses were negligible in the quarter now that the majority of the NCL book is accounted for at fair value.  Notably, underlying opex was down 9% as we continue to reduce headcount.  Integration- related \\nexpenses of 749 million consisted mainly of real estate impairment charges.  \\n  \\n \\n Page 6 of 32 \\n Slide 13 – Maintained capital strength with CET1 ratio comfortably above guidance  \\nMoving to CET1 capital and RWA on Slide 13.  Our capital position remains strong, with capital ratios \\ncomfortably above our guidance and regulatory requirements.  The CET1 capital ratio improved 10 basis points \\nto 14.5% as the negative impacts from the reported loss and dividend accruals were more than offset by RWA \\nreductions ex -FX and a net write -up of temporary difference DTAs.   \\nBoth CET1 capital and RWAs were significantly impacted by currency translation, which broadly offset each other in the CET1 capital ratio.  Currency translation effects also accounted for mo re of the 80 billion increase \\nin LRD this quarter.  We also retained higher HQLA to underpin increased deposit balances and to address the \\nnew Swiss liquidity requirements that just took effect.  I will return shortly to comment on how we’re thinking \\nmore broadly about capital, liquidity and funding, as we work towards delivering our financial ambitions by the end of 2026.  \\nLet me also briefly touch on a few reporting changes we are implementing from the first quarter of 2024.  First, \\nwe are transferring the high net -worth client segment from the Swiss Bank of Credit Suisse to Global Wealth \\nManagement to best meet our clients’ needs and align to UBS’s divisional structure.  These clients represent an \\nestimated 60 billion in invested assets and 550 million in annual revenues.  Second, and as I highlighted last \\nquarter, we are pushing out to our business divisions substantially all  balance sheet, equity and P&L items that \\nwere previously retained centrally.  We will restate 2023 to ensure comparability and publish an updated time \\nseries ahead of 1Q results.  \\nWith that, I’ll hand back to Sergio for the investor update.  \\n \\n  \\n \\n Page 7 of 32 \\n Sergio P. Ermotti  \\n \\nSlide 15 – Attractive business model with unique global asset gathering businesses  \\nThank you, Todd.  For more than a decade, UBS has stood out among its G -SIB peers for its favorable mix of \\nbusinesses and unique model.  Our global asset gathering operation and Swiss universal bank are at the core of \\nour strategy, and they are complemented by our capital -light Investment Bank.  Since 2012, our ambition to be \\nthe world’s leading global wealth manager has served us well, allowing us to generate over 50 billion in capital \\nfor shareholders through the end of 2022, while also investing in sustaina ble, long -term growth.   \\nSlide 16 – Accelerating our strategy by enhancing client franchises, capabilities and scale  \\nThe Credit Suisse deal accelerates our strategy. We are the only truly global wealth manager with nearly 4 \\ntrillion in invested assets across a client franchise that would be nearly impossible to replicate.  Globally, GWM \\nclients benefit from our unparalleled advice, products and services.  We are the number one wealth manager in \\nSwitzerland, EMEA and APAC.  In these regions, our invested assets have grown by at least 50% due to the \\nacquisition – the equivalent of a decade of growth.  In the Americas, we are a top player in the U.S., and are \\nnumber one in Latin America.   \\nThe acquisition is also reinforcing our position as the number one universal bank in Switzerland.  This is not a \\nfunction of our size or market share, but the clear result of the value we bring to our clients through our one -\\nfirm approach, expertise and global reach that is particularly important to our large corporate and Small and Medium Enterprise cl ients.  \\nWith 1.6 trillion in invested assets, Asset Management has improved our competitiveness globally and expanded our presence in growth markets.  We have strengthened the value provided to clients through complementary \\nproducts across key asset classes.  \\nIn the Investment Bank, we are reinforcing our competitive position with our key clients.  We will continue to \\nbuild durable and profitable market share in the areas that differentiate UBS for our clients, while now deploying a smaller proportion of the Group’s financial resources, compared to pre -acquisition levels.  \\nSlide 17 – Executing to capture long- term growth and value creation  \\nWe finished 2023 with strong momentum in terms of our integration timeline.  While we have full confidence \\nin our ability to fulfil our goals, we are not complacent about the magnitude and complexity of the task ahead. Given the evident structural issues with Credit Suisse’s business model and lack of profitability, there is a significant amount of restructuring and optimization that must take place over the next three years before we \\ncan harvest the full benefits of the combination.  \\nAs we previously communicated, during 2024 and 2025, we will incur substantial integration- related expenses \\nas we materially restructure and remove duplication across our operations.  The Non -core and Legacy portfolio \\nwill continue to be a meaningful drag on our results as it is actively unwound.  In addition, over the next three \\nyears, Credit Suisse’s core businesses will also continue to require balance sheet optimization.  While we will \\nsacrifice some reported profitability and growth in the short- term, we are convinced this will improve the quality \\nof our long- term growth trajectory, and bring greater cost and capital efficiency.  As a result, we are reiterating \\nour targets to realize an underlying return on CET1 capital of around 15% and cost/income ratio of less than \\n70% as we exit 2026.  \\n \\n Page 8 of 32 \\n Slide 18 – Restructuring and delivering on integration milestones by end- 2026  \\nAs I’ve said before, 2024 is a pivotal year for UBS.  We are taking a staged approach in our execution plan to \\nminimize the risk of disruption for clients and employees.  With over six thousand deliverables over the next \\nthree years, the task is not as simple as the illustrative overview you see on slide 18.  We expect to complete the \\nmerger of our parent banks and establish a single US IHC by the end of the first half of the year. The merger of \\nour Swiss entities should occur before the end of the third quarter.  Completing these key milestones will allow \\nus to realize the associated cost, capital and funding benefits.  These significant legal -entity mergers are a pre -\\nrequisite for the first wave of client migrations and will allow us to begin streamlining and decommissioning \\nlegacy platforms in the second half of 2024. This process will continue into 2025 before we begin the transition \\ntowards our target state in 2026.  \\nSlide 19 – Building capacity to invest and achieve <70% cost/income ratio by end- 2026  \\nAgain, I ’m sure we all appreciate the significant costs associated with running and combining two G -SIBs, \\nincluding one that is still structurally unprofitable.  This is why a pure integration cost journey is not enough.  We \\nalso need to deeply restructure to get to an appropriate cost base.  \\nTherefore, the realization of our integration plans and the run- down of the Non- core and Legacy portfolio is \\nexpected to result in around 13 billion in gross cost reductions by the end of 2026. In addition to supporting \\nour cost/income ratio target, this decrease also provides us with the necessary capacity to enhance the resilience of our combined infrastructure.  It will also allow us to continue to drive enduring growth by investing in talent, \\nproducts and services. We will focus on improving the client experience and lowering the cost  to serve by \\nleveraging our already -leading technology proficiencies.  \\nSlide 20 – Optimizing financial resources to enable sustainable growth and higher returns  \\nAnother key driver of value creation will come from improved use of our financial resources.  Obviously, the \\nmost prominent example is the Non -core and Legacy portfolio, where we expect our wind- down efforts to \\nresult in a capital release of over 6 billion by the end of 2026. Of equal importance, we need to optimize the utilization of financial res ources across the core businesses to improve returns on risk -weighted assets.  \\nAs you can see on the slide, Credit Suisse’s capital efficiency and profitability were compromised in recent years by capital intensive exposures, underpriced resources and products, and hurdle rates that were not aligned to \\nunderlying risks. While in the short- term, it will be difficult to produce the best -in-class returns that UBS had \\npreviously, our aim is to narrow the gap in a reasonable timeframe.  This will require re -pricing and/or exiting \\nlow returning exposures.  We will also remain disciplined to e nsure that pricing reflects the underlying risks and \\nthe value of the advice, products and services we provide.  As we do this, we w ill expect to capture gross inflows \\nin GWM and P&C as we prioritize relationships where we provide more holistic client coverage.  As I said, we \\nassume that our actions to improve capital efficiency will result in a lower growth trajectory through 2025, a necessary trade -off to create long -term value.  \\nSlide 21 – GWM – Building on our unrivaled global scale and footprint  \\nNow, moving to our medium -term priorities and ambitions for our business divisions, starting with GWM.  We \\nhave robust momentum across our entire platform and our top objectives are to stay close to clients and improve advisor productivity.  In Switzerland, EMEA and APAC, we expect PBT margins to eventually exceed 40% in each \\nof these regions as we capture the benefits of our fortified leadership positions and integration- related \\nsynergies.  \\n \\n Page 9 of 32 \\n While our U.S. wealth management business will profit from our strengthened Investment Bank and Asset \\nManagement franchises, it is not directly benefiting from increased scale related to the acquisition.  Therefore, \\nwe need to keep working on improving our profitability.  Over the next three years, we will organically invest to \\ninstitutionalize our platform by building out our core banking infrastructure to provide clients with a more comprehensive loan and deposit offering, and by rolling out more products a nd services to Ultra High Net Worth \\nand family and institutional wealth clients.   \\nWe will further leverage our advisory capabilities through our global CIO platform.  In particular, we aim to \\nprovide our international clients who have interests in the U.S. with more access to our American advisors and \\nproducts.  We will also continue to invest in our infrastructure to augment the user experience and improve \\nproductivity.  We expect PBT margins in the U.S. to remain in the low double digits in the near -term, but we are \\nconfident that the actions we take will help produce mid- teens profit mar gins by the end of 2026.  This will put \\nus in a position to explore opportunities to further narrow the gap to our peers.   \\nSlide 22 – GWM – Ambition to surpass 5trn of invested assets over next five years \\nOur actions will allow GWM to attract around 100 billion in net new assets per annum through 2025 as we expect  to continue growth i n our platform to partially offset by outflows related to the capital efficiency \\ninitiatives I described a moment ago. From 2026, our aim is to build to around 200 billion in net new assets \\nannually by 2028.  Overall, this level of organic growth over three years would nearly add up to the Credit Suisse \\nfranchise we just acquired, and will power our ambition to surpass 5 trillion in invested assets. Greater scale \\nalongside our cost and capital efficiency measur es will support GWM’s ability to achieve improved profitability \\nwith an expected underlying cost/income ratio of less than 70%.  \\nSlide 23 – P&C - #1 bank in Switzerland with unparalleled reach and strong returns  \\nIn Switzerland, we are the leading bank for multi -nationals and SMEs , and we also serve more than one in three \\nhouseholds.  To reiterate, our uniqueness is not driven by size, but by our ability to provide these clients with \\naccess to innovative products, solutions, digital applications and global footprint.  \\nIn recent years, P&C’s consistent investments to improve the client experience and boost efficiency has \\nsupported steady growth and higher returns.  We will replicate this playbook for our combined client franchises.  \\nMeanwhile, we will lower our cost to serve by streamlining our operations, decommissioning legacy technology \\nplatforms and removing branch duplication. Our ambition is for P&C to report a cost/income ratio below 50% \\nas we exit 2026.  \\nSlide 24 – AM – Improved positioning across key asset classes and growth markets \\nIn Asset Management, we are building on our differentiated offering in Sustainable Investing and SMAs with \\nan expanded Alternatives platform, which includes new capabilities in Credit. Our aim is to keep growing our \\nhigher margin products, and capture the benefits of our increased scale in customized Indexing and a deeper \\nregional footprint.  We will do this while building on our strong partnership with Global Wealth Management \\nto drive growth.  \\nWhile our improved strategic positioning and product offering will help us meet the evolving needs of our clients, we are not immune to structural issues facing the asset management industry.  This makes the realization \\nof cost synergies a critical component of our plan to get to a cost/income ratio below 70% by the end of 2026, while self -funding investments for growth and efficiency  will be delivered . \\n \\n Page 10 of 32 \\n Slide 25 – IB – Enhancing client offering while maintaining capital discipline  \\nThe acquisition has added capabilit y that were already of strategic importance for our Investment Bank.  \\nTherefore, in terms of strategy, clients’  priorities and risk discipline, nothing changes.  In Global Banking, we \\nhave significantly strengthened our coverage and product teams in growth markets that are aligned to GWM, \\nnotably the Americas and APAC. We have reinforced our leading position in Switzerland.  And globally, we \\nexpect our broader and deeper solutions across M&A, Equity Capital Markets and Leveraged Capital Markets \\nto drive profitable market share gains.  We are already seeing the benefits with notable mandate successes \\nacross the globe.  \\nIn Global Markets, we are bolstering core products and services that are most relevant to our clients, including \\nElectronic Trading, Financing and Equity Derivatives.  Our award -winning Equities and FX franchises will now \\nserve an even larger and broader client base, also supported by our strengthened Global Research coverage of \\nthe most relevant and fastest- growing sectors.  By deploying its products and services across a more diversified \\ninstitutional, corporate and financial sponsor client base, in addition to the improved connectivity with our \\nclients in GWM and P&C, the Investment Bank is poised to achieve around 15% return on attributed equity \\nover the cycle.  And it will do this while consuming no more than 25% of the Group’s risk weighted assets.  \\nSlide 26 – Non- core and Legacy – driving lower costs and efficient capital release  \\nAs I mentioned before, the active run -down of the Non- core and Legacy portfolio releases capital, removes tail \\nrisks and complexity, and reduces our cost base, allowing us to improve our returns.  We have made good \\nprogress to date.  We have closed over two thousand NCL books, including full exits of several macro books, \\nand are largely closed – we have largely closed our non- core Cash Equities, Convertibles and Prime Services \\nexposures.  \\nTo date, we have decommissioned around 150 of NCL systems, and retired nearly 20% of its models.  As we \\nfurther wind down this portfolio, we will focus on economic profitability, including funding, operating and capital costs.  We will also remain focused on balancing our priorities with the needs of our clients and \\ncounterparties. Our ambition is for NCL’s underlying loss to move to around 1 billion, with the residual portfolio \\nof total risk weighted assets accounting for around  5% of the Group’s by the end of 2026. By the end of 2024, \\nwe expect combined risk – credit and market risk  risk-weighted assets  to be substantially below 40 billion.  \\nSlide 27 – Balancing resiliency, growth and attractive capital returns  \\nCapital strength has been a key pillar of our strategy, and we remain committed to maintaining a balance sheet for all seasons.  We expect to operate with a CET1 capital ratio of around 14%.  This will provide us with a \\nsubstantial capital buffer relative to our minimum regulatory requirements during the integration, but also as our capital requirements increase over time.   \\nAs we fund growth with part of our retained profits, we will also seek to calibrate the proportion of cash dividends versus buybacks.  For the 2023 financial year, we intend to propose an ordinary dividend of 70 cents, \\na 27% increase year -on-year. With respect to our progressive dividend policy, we are accounting  for a mid -teen \\npercentage increase in 2024.  We also plan to continue to distribute excess capital to shareholders via \\nrepurchases.  In the short term, it is prudent to hold off until the parent bank merger is complete in the first half \\nof this year.  Then, we expect to resume buying back stock s, with a target of up to 1 billion dollars in 2024. Our \\nambition in 2026 is for total capital returns to exceed pre -acquisition levels, with share repurchases most likely \\nbeing the biggest component.  \\n \\n Page 11 of 32 \\n Slide 28 – Rebuilding profitability while restructuring for sustainable growth  \\nAs you can see from this slide, in terms of returns on capital, we expect to build towards our 15% return on \\nCET1 target as we exit 2026, with 2024 still reflecting the significant restructuring and optimization work taking \\nplace as we integrate Credit Sui sse.  \\nOur plan is not relying on overly optimistic market assumptions.  And, if necessary, we have the flexibility to \\nadjust our plans as needed to respond to changes in the underlying assumptions.  When our cost and capital \\nefficiency measures are behind us, we expect to increase – we expect our increased scale and enhanced client \\nfranchises will position us to attain sustainably higher returns, starting with a reported return on CET1 capital of around 18% in 2028.  \\nWith that, I hand back to Todd for more details on our plans.  \\n \\n Page 12 of 32 \\n Todd Tuckner  \\n \\nSlide 30 – Our path to ~15% underlying RoCET1 by year -end 2026  \\nThanks again, Sergio.  The strategic and detailed planning we’ve undertaken over the last several months now \\ninforms a clear path towards our objectives of generating an underlying return on CET1 capital of around 15% \\nand an underlying cost -income ratio of less than 70% by the time we complete the integration of Credit Suisse \\nat the end of 2026. In the next few minutes, I’ll describe the ways in which we expect to achieve these \\nobjectives, offer details on trajectories, and comment on how we’ll measure progress.  \\nI want to emphasize that our plans are based on the complex work required to restructure a cost base that at \\npresent supports the infrastructure of two G -SIBs, and to enhance the returns on financial resources deployed \\nin our core businesses that have been diluted by the acquisition.  These significant efficiency undertakings come \\nat a cost, whether through integration -related expenses or somewhat slower net new asset growth while we \\noptimize the balance sheet over the next few quarters.  Ultimately, the key to delivering our long- term financial \\nambitions is the discipline we’re applying now in driving cost and financial resource effici ency.  \\nMoving to slide 30, which provides an overview of the main drivers of the expected return on capital uplift \\nbetween now and the end of 2026. Our financial ambitions are mainly dependent on controllable factors and market assumptions that are in line with consensus, rather than blue -sky scenarios.  Our focus is on building \\nhigh quality and sustainable revenue streams to support healthy and attractive returns over the long term. In this respect we’ll drive most of the improvement over the integration timeline by right sizing our cost base, \\noptimizing financial resources, and normalizing the tax rate.  \\nImportantly, by building our plans primarily around cost and resource optimization, we retain flexibility and optionality in execution.  For example, while we expect to continue investing for growth in our core businesses, \\nwe have discretion to pace this spend in case markets are less constructive. Finally, as we progress with simplification of our legal entity structure, we’ll see additional support to our capital returns from the normalization of the effective tax rate, dropping to around 23% by 2026.  \\nSlide 31 – Revenue plans reflect enhanced capabilities and improved productivity  \\nMoving to details of our revenue expectations, on slide 31.  First, we believe GWM’s income outside of NII will \\nbe one of the main drivers of our growth.  As we expand our GWM invested asset base and enhance our solution \\nofferings and capabilities, we expect to increase both recurring- fee and transaction- based income, with stronger \\nnet margins.  By staying close to our clients, continuing to win back assets, and offering differentiated products \\nand services to help navigate challenging market conditions, we expect to attract around 200 billion in net new assets over the next two years while optimizing returns on financial resources.  Beyond 2025, with the \\noptimization work largely behind us , we expect annual net new asset growth to build to 200 billion by 2028 \\nand to surpass 5 trillion in assets under management at that time.  \\nIn addition to growing our asset base, we believe we’re in a strong position to offset some of the structural fee margin pressure visible in the industry by leveraging a unified shelf of CIO -led products and solutions as well as \\nincreasing discretionary ma ndate penetration across our expanded client base.  Further positive contribution to \\nour GWM top line is expected from transaction -based fees.  This growth is expected to be driven by the \\ncontinued expansion of distribution channels and product capabilities,  including growing and leveraging our \\nsuccessful GWM- IB joint coverage initiatives as well as broadening our scalable transaction -based advisory \\nofferings for high- and ultra -high net worth clients , and clients with professional markets expertise. On top of \\n \\n Page 13 of 32 \\n revenue improvement, we also believe we can enhance GWM’s net margins and drive greater returns overall, \\nby leveraging the benefits of increased scale, realizing cost synergies from the Credit Suisse integration, and \\nemphasizing data and AI capabilities to improve advisor productivity.  \\nSecond, in our Investment Bank, we’re well positioned to achieve revenue accretion relatively quickly, especially as we’re selectively adding key Credit Suisse IB resources directly to the UBS platform.  As a result, we accelerate \\nour IB strategy by doubling our Banking presence in the US and building on our market -leading strengths in \\nSwitzerland, EMEA and APAC.  As the newly -onboarded bankers return to full productivity over the next 12 -18 \\nmonths, we expect Banking to generate almost twice its baseline revenues by 2026, assuming supportive markets.  We also aim to drive incremental client flow across Derivatives & Solutions, Execution Services and \\nFinancing, with support from around 400 Credit Suisse colleagues joining our  Markets business.  Additionally, \\nwe expect continued revenue growth in the IB from technology and resource investments we've made in capabilities such as Research, FX, prime brokerage and equity derivatives, and from increased connectivity \\nbetween the IB and GWM.  We also price  in a return to more normalized markets vs 2023.  \\nMoving to net interest income in GWM and P&C.  As I mentioned earlier, we expect NII in US dollar terms to \\nremain roughly stable in the first quarter of 2024 versus 4Q23.  As we look out beyond the first quarter, full \\nyear 2024 NII is expected to decline by mid- single digits from annualized 4Q23 levels mainly on lower rates and \\nas our financial resource optimization measures impact loan volumes.  Over the second half of the plan horizon, \\nwe expect NII to recover, resulting from funding cost efficiencies, stable implied forward rates, and improved \\nloan revenues.  I’ll cover the steps we’re taking to drive funding efficiencies in a few moments.  \\nRounding out the revenue picture across core businesses.  We expect stable revenues in P&C, outside of NII, and \\nin Asset Management, as we take actions to offset market headwinds and potential dis- synergies from the \\nCredit Suisse acquisition while focusing these franchises on driving cost synergy realization and improvements \\nin operating efficiency.  In particular, P&C will continue its focus on winning back flows, improving asset \\nefficiency, and defending market share in Switzerland while Asset Management em beds new investment \\ncapabilities acquired from Credit Suisse and continues its key role in providing advisory support to our Global \\nWealth Management clients.   \\nFinally, in NCL, we’re not pricing in revenue growth as we look forward, as the now largely fair value book reflects our expectation of exit prices.  The roughly 3.1 billion of PPA adjustments we made to the NCL accrual \\nbook , before we tagged most of the positions as held for sale, are now subsumed in the marks.  Hence, we \\nexpect NCL revenues in any given quarter from here to be around zero with position P&L from sales, unwinds and marks, net of hedging and funding costs, all to be broadly offsetting.  Of cour se, as our first priority in NCL \\nremains taking out costs and releasing sub- optimally deployed capital, we’ll at times sacrifice P&L on position \\nexits in pursuit of these aims.  \\nSlide 32 – ~13bn of cumulative gross cost saves to be achieved by year -end 2026  \\nTurning to costs on Slide 32.  Of the around 13 billion in gross cost saves we expect to deliver by the end of \\n2026, around 4 billion, or one -third, are already reflected in our 2023 exit rate.  By the end of 2024, we expect \\nto generate more than 2 billion in gross exit -rate saves, with more towards the latter half of the year after \\ncompletion of the largest legal entity mergers.  As indicated on the slide, we expect to drive further gross cost \\nsaves of around 4 billion by the end of 2025 with the balance coming out as we exit 2026. The non-linear \\ntrajectory of cost saves between 2023 and 2026 reflects the intensity of our integration work, with the legal \\nentity mergers, migration of over a million clients, and decommissioning of platforms requiring significant  levels \\nof workforce to execute against our timelines, especially over the next 12- 18 months.   \\n \\n Page 14 of 32 \\n As we progress on, and ultimately complete, these complex aspects of the integration, our resource \\nrequirements for these various programs of work will diminish, leading to considerable cost reductions by the \\nend of 2025, when we expect to have delivered a  substantial portion of our integration milestones.  The back-\\nend portion of our cost save plan relates mainly to completing hardware and software decommissioning, in \\nparticular switching off redundant legacy applications and infrastructure.  This includes t he applications in the \\nvarious support and control functions, like Risk and Finance, where the work is naturally sequenced to follow \\nthe completion of client -facing technology decommissioning.  As Sergio mentioned, we’ll re -invest part of the \\ngross saves generated from the integration into enhancing the resilience of our technology estate and funding organic business growth in our core divisions.  \\nIn terms of the nature of the gross cost saves, we expect that roughly half will be personnel -related costs as we \\nstreamline our front office operations across businesses and deliver synergies in our support and control functions.  The remaining balance of saves will be derived predominantly from hardware and software \\ndecommissioning, real estate rationalization, and reduced service requirements from external providers and contractors.  \\nMoving to integration- related expenses, which we expect to total to around 13 billion by the end of 2026, \\nincluding the 4 and a half  billion incurred to date.  Our objective is to front- load these expenses where possible \\nas they typically pave the way for run -rate savings.  For example, in real estate, we’ve taken restructuring and \\nimpairment charges on select properties, reducing the current run -rate cost of our footprint by 400 million per \\nyear, down 15% from 2022 levels. This save comes as a result of taki ng 1 billion in integration- related real \\nestate charges through the end of 2023, with a payback of 2.5 years.  \\nThis said, the timing of integration -related expenses and the resulting saves vary, depending on the cost \\ncategory.  Some charges can be provisioned upfront, as in the real estate example, while other provisions are \\nrecorded later, like severance costs for personnel whose services are required until an integration milestone is completed, such as the legal entity mergers or client platform migration. While we remain focused on accelerating these costs- to-achieve future savings wherever possible, we nevertheless expect to recognize \\nintegration -related expenses over the entire 3 -year planning horizon, albeit with as much as 80 to 90% incurred \\nby the end of 2025.  Although the timing will differ, we still expect total integration -related costs to be broadly \\noffset in our pre -tax P&L by the recognition of PPA- related pull -to-par revenue effects, including the portion \\nnow in the NCL marks, as described earlier.  \\nSlide 33 – Non- core and Legacy to be a key contributor to Group net cost saves  \\nTurning to NCL costs on slide 33.  We expect around half of the Group’s planned 13 billion in gross saves, and \\na considerable majority of net saves, to be achieved as a function of running down NCL’s book as well as \\neliminating its broader cost stack related to Credit Suisse’s complex legal entity structure and its historical G -SIB \\nstatus.  This includes expenses associated with governing, operating and maintaining Credit Suisse’s many \\nregulated legal entities and branches.  As I have highlighted, the mergers of our largest group entities later this \\nyear are expected to enable further workforce consolidation and management de-layering. For referenc e, our \\ntarget legal entity structure is presented in the Appendix.   \\nAdditionally, with complete exits of larger books of business in NCL, we expect to drive cost saves by reducing staff aligned to the unit and eliminating expensive -to-maintain technology applications and infrastructure.  In \\nthis respect, we expect the trajectory of cost saves in NCL to accelerate in the second half of this year and to \\nhasten further over the course of the following two years depending on the timing of larger -scale exits of \\nposition books.  Ultimately, our objective is to limit the cost drag from NCL to a level substantially below 1 billion \\nas we exit 2026, a drop of over 85% when compared to its 2022 cost base.   \\n \\n Page 15 of 32 \\n Since the formation of NCL after the Credit Suisse acquisition, we’ve also taken steps to reduce the risk that \\nany remaining costs are left stranded once we stop reporting NCL as a separate segment, expected in 2027.  \\nWe completed most of this work ahead of NCL’s formation when we reviewed the way in which Credit Suisse’s \\nCorporate Center costs were allocated among divisions.  As part of our planning process we identified an \\nadditional 300 million of such costs that we’ll reallocate to the core business divisions, where they are more appropriately managed.  This change will form part of the planned restatements that I described earlier.  For \\n2024, we expect NCL to incur underlying operating expenses of around 4 billion, generating a pre -tax loss of \\nalso around 4 billion in light of the zero revenue guidance I offered e arlier.   \\nSlide 34 – Balance sheet for all seasons remains the foundation of our success  \\nMoving to our balance sheet on slide 34.  Maintaining a balance sheet for all seasons is key to everything we \\ndo. It gives us the ability to withstand financial shocks and the flexibility to support our clients in all climates.  \\nIt’s especially critical during this complex integration process.  As highlighted earlier during the fourth quarter \\nreview, we’re maintaining appropriately prudent capital and liquidity levels while executing the restructuring of Credit Suisse and preparing for new regulatory requireme nts. This is also the case for our key operating \\nsubsidiaries. With these considerations in mind, I’ll now cover how we think about capital, liquidity and funding across the Group as we look out over the planning horizon.   \\nSlide 35 – Strong capital position at group and pro forma combined parent bank level  \\nFirst, capital.  At the end of 4Q, the Group maintained a going- concern capital ratio of 17.0%, over 200 basis \\npoints above the current Swiss requirements, comprised of 14.5% in CET1 capital and 2.5% in additional Tier 1 capital.  Between 2026 and 2030 our going- concern capital requirement is expected to increase by around \\n180 basis points to 16.7% as the effects of the currently larger balance sheet and greater market share from \\nthe Credit Suisse acquisition are phased -in. To improve efficiency of our capital stack, we intend to fund this \\nincrease by cost -effectively building -out the permissible AT1 bucket over time, bringing the going concern \\ncapital ratio to around 18% while broadly maintaining our CET1 capital ratio at around 14%.  In this respect, \\nfollowing last year’s successful raises, we expect to issue up to 2 billion in AT1 in 2024.   \\nA word on going concern capital at our parent bank, UBS AG, on a pro- forma post- merger basis.  The main \\ntake- away here is that we expect a healthy buffer over regulatory requirements on a fully applied basis and \\neven without the substantial regulatory concession historically applied to Credit Suisse AG’s investments in \\nsubsidiaries.  Any increases in UBS AG’s going- concern capital requirements from greater market share and a \\nlarger balance sheet will be funded in much the same way I described for the Group, and by being disciplined in right -sizing UBS AG and its subsidiaries.  In terms of gone -concern capital, I would highlight that, for now, \\nUBS AG’s standalone requirement serves as the binding constraint for the Group.  As such, we consider the \\nGroup’s current substantial TLAC buffers to be appropriate, and, accordingly, we intend to replace maturing TLAC at similar tenors.  Over time, as we reduce the leverage in our businesses, we expect to see the level of \\nHoldco start to tick down, with some potential to tig hten average spreads in the back book.   \\nOn to liquidity and funding.  Beyond our approach to TLAC and AT1, our strategic objective in the context of \\nliquidity and funding is to balance efficiency with resiliency and safety. In this respect, we maintain liquidity \\nlevels among the highest in the industry, satisfying the more stringent Swiss liquidity requirements that took \\neffect last month.  At the same time, we’ve begun executing on a funding plan that drives significant funding \\ncost efficiencies over the next 3 years, principally from reducing the size of our balance sheet.  Specifically, we \\nexpect to reduce LRD by over 100 billion at constant FX via the wind- down of NCL and from resource \\noptimization across our core business divisions, driving down funding needs.   \\n \\n Page 16 of 32 \\n We also aim to narrow the structural funding gap of the Swiss entity inherited from Credit Suisse, increasing \\nthe self- sufficiency of the post- merger Swiss banking subsidiary.  In this respect, deposits remain a key source \\nof funding.  We’ll continue to focus on winning them back, with emphasis on stability reflected in tenors, \\nproducts, and counterparty selection.  In addition to applying discipline on deposit pricing, we expect to take \\nactions to optimize our funding mix and drive down costs, including reducing our levels of OpCo by making \\nfurther use of Swiss covered bonds and tapping an expanded variety of funding markets.  Overall, as a result of \\nlower funding needs, diversified and more stable funding sources, tighter issuance spreads relative to 2023 \\nlevels, and disciplined deposit pricing, we believe we can realize funding cost saves of up to 1 billion by 2026 \\non top of t he saves achieved last year.  This is reflected in our long -term NII guidance that I described earlier.   \\nSlide 36 – RWA expected to decrease by ~35bn due to optimization and NCL unwind  \\nLet me now walk you through our RWA expectations over the next three years.  In NCL, we expect the run -off \\nof its book to drive a decrease in risk weighted assets of 45 billion by the end of 2026 bringing us to around 5% of the Group’s total RWAs before any further post -integration de -risking. In our core businesses, we expect \\nBasel 3 to increase RWA by around 15 billion beginning in 2025, primarily from FRTB, credit risk, and CVA \\nchanges in the final standard.  The core businesses are also expected to absorb  around 10 billion of additional \\nRWA, net of 14 billion from converting Credit Suisse’s risk models to the appropriate UBS standard.   \\nI would also highlight that we expect the resource optimization work we’re undertaking to result in RWA reduction of around 15 billion in the core businesses.  Importantly , this impact can vary depending on the \\navailability of revenue- growth opportunities driving accretive returns.  All told, over the next 3 years, Group \\nRWA is expected to drop from its current levels by 35 billion at constant FX, freeing up around 5 billion in CET1 capital.  \\nSlide 37 – Effective tax rate to reduce following key legal entity mergers  \\nTurning to tax, on slide 37.  As mentioned, we expect to operate with a relatively high effective tax rate in 2024, \\nmainly due to losses generated by various Credit Suisse entities, primarily in Switzerland, the US and the UK, that cannot at present offset profits in their counterpart UBS entities in the same jurisdictions.  The legal entity \\nmergers planned for later this year will resolve a considerable level of this inefficiency, driving down our effective \\ntax rate to around 40% by the end of 2024.  Further optimization of our legal entity structure, combined with \\nimproved profitability and opportunities for tax planning, are expected to drive the effective tax rate to below \\n30% by the end of 2025, and finally to our normal levels of around 23% in 2026.  \\nIn terms of deferred tax assets, our year -end 2023 balance sheet reflects recognition of around 3 billion in net \\ntax loss DTAs, mainly relating to the US.  Of those, we expect to amortize around 0.5 billion against profits and \\nconvert around 2 billion into temporary difference DTAs by the end of 2025, seeking to maintain a balance equal to the eligible cap of 10% of our CET1 capital.  The remaining level of recognized net tax loss DTAs of \\n0.5 billion, absent further planning considerations, is expected to rem ain relatively stable over the near term. It \\nis worth highlighting that the more modest level of tax loss DTAs expected over the next couple of years limits the impact of one of the key differentiators between tangible equity and CET1, signal ling their convergence.  \\nSlide 38 – Delivering on our priorities while creating long- term sustainable value  \\nFinally, let me briefly touch on how we plan to communicate our progress across the integration timeline.  As \\nyou would expect, demonstrating the headway we’re making in our cost reduction plans is, and will remain, of paramount importance.  We intend to regularly report on developments, and to track our performance vs the \\nopex and integration cost trajectories I described earlier, even when we switch back to focusing on year -over-\\n \\n Page 17 of 32 \\n year comparisons by 3Q24.  NCL risk reduction will continue to feature in our quarterly performance reporting.  \\nAnd we’ll periodically check in on where we stand in terms of key integration milestones, including the legal \\nentity mergers, systems migration of client accounts and infrastructure decommissioning, as well as improving \\noverall efficiency in the utilizatio n of our financial resources.  \\nWith that, I hand back to Sergio for his closing remarks before we move to Q&A.  \\n \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\n \\nThank you, Todd.  \\nTo re -cap, we are pleased with the progress we have made so far.  As you can see, and you heard, we have \\ndetailed plans to achieve our ambitions. We are in full execution mode.  While our progress over the next three \\nyears will not be measured in a straight line, our strategy is clear.  With enhanced scale and capabilities across \\nour leading client franchises and improved resource discipline, we will drive sustainable long- term growth and \\nhigher returns.   \\nWe are confident that by the end of 2026 and beyond, this will allow us to deliver significant value for all of \\nour stakeholders.  Particularly, our clients will benefit from even – an even stronger products  and service  \\ncapabilities . Our people will have a better platform to grow their careers. And our shareholders will benefit \\nfrom higher capital returns. Last but not least, we will remain a reliable economic partner, employer and taxpayer in the communities where we operate.  \\nWith that, let’s get started with  questions.   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Page 18 of 32 \\n Analyst Q&A (CEO and CFO)  \\n \\nKian Abouhossein , JP Morgan  \\nYes. First of all, thanks for taking my questions. Looking at the slides, I can put together a revenue picture as \\nyou're giving some details around return on risk -weighted assets in the long term, as well as your risk -\\nweighted assets overall absolute. So, I get to about $48.5 billion of revenues, which implies around 70% cost income of $34 billion. And clearly, first of all, I wanted to see if the revenue assumption that I'm making here calculation is reasonable and what underlying scenarios you use to calculate that. And secondly, on t he cost \\nside, clearly, even if I assume some kind of growth rate in kind of cost inflation, I still see that most of the cost \\nsavings come from your legacy non -core reductions. So, it looks like a lot of flexibility. So, can you talk a little \\nbit about – is my calculation correct to some extent? And secondly, how should I think about the cost \\nflexibility as it seems to mainly come from Non -core and Legacy? That's the first question.  \\nIf I may, just secondly, on the Investment Bank. You're clearly making a big investment push, and here I want \\nto understand at what point do you see delivery has to be achieved. I think you mentioned end- 2026 in terms \\nof revenue improvement, but is there any milestones that have to be achieved order to illustrate that this cost \\nincome will continuously improve not just in the first quarter?  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nThanks for  your questions. Let me take the first. So, I think in terms of the way you're thinking about it, I'd \\nsay the key is to think about a cost income ratio below 70% is really the driver as we exit 2026. You know, the revenue picture that we gave, as I comment ed, is not based on blue sky scenarios. You see that for two of \\nthe core business divisions, we effectively priced in, you know, flat revenue growth. NCL, we priced in flat revenue growth. We talked quite, you know, I think appropriately about what we woul d expect from GWM \\nas it improves its asset base. And of course, on the IB, coming from a low 2023 and given the onboarding of \\nthe Credit Suisse b ankers we discussed and getting them productive over the next 12 to 18 months, one \\ncould see that our revenue picture is, you know, is appropriate in that respect and not toppy.  \\nThat said, you know, when you look at, say, the return on RWA, which is I think what you used as a basis, \\nyou know, that is certainly our ambition is to do the financial resource optimization to improve  our – the ratio \\nof revenues over RWA, and that's clearly something we know we need to do. You saw in the depiction of \\nhow dilutive the CS revenues have been on that metric. So clearly, we're going to keep working on that. But \\nthe key really to take away here is  that, you know, as both Sergio and I said, we have the flexibility to, you \\nknow, pace the reinvestments of the $13 billion in gross cost saves depending on how that revenue trajectory \\ndevelops.  So, for us, that's really the ke y, maintaining less than a 70% cost income ratio. That's where the \\ndiscipline comes in and as I said, pricing in what is an appropriate revenue picture and just ensuring we keep \\nto the gross cost saves and then we could pace the reinvestment as appropriate . \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nKian, vis -a-vis your second question on the IB, I think of course we do expect the onboarded resources, \\nparticularly in the banking part of the business, to start to ramp -up to average productivity of the incumbent \\nUBS bankers. And that will happen and is already happening, to be honest, because we have been observing \\ngood mandates winning. Of course, now what we need is the second condition how do I – first one is do we \\nwin mandates? Do we get tractions? And the answer is clearly yes. So, I'm very pleased with that outcome. \\nNow, the most difficult question to answer is, is the market going to be there to support monetizing those \\n \\n Page 19 of 32 \\n mandates? And you know what's going on. It's very difficult to predict the near future. So, past a very, very \\nhard 2023 but the momentum is very good. So, I do think that is important to measure that.  \\nThe other observation I tried to take on executed transaction will be are we gaining market shares? How do \\nwe do relatively to our competitors? A third element which is very important for me, how is the IB \\ncontributing to the value creation in our Wealth M anagement and P&C businesses because it is very, very \\nimportant, is a pillar, is a very important driver and particularly now in the US but also for example in \\nAustralia, but also in APAC , in general. We can drive this real value creation by working closer  together. But \\nlastly, it will be over the cycle , can they deliver return on allocated equity, as we've said, as a target? So, it's a \\nset of short- term and medium- term and long- term measures that we will use, but I'm confident that the \\ntrajectory we had in the last seven, eight years, which has volatilit y elements, will continue but in a way that \\naccrue value to our shareholders and clients.  \\nKian Abouhossein, JP Morgan  \\nThank you.  \\nChris Hallam , Goldman Sachs  \\nThanks. So, first, on slide 28. If I zoom in on 2026, you've guided to an exit run rates of 15% return on core \\nTier 1. But for the year as a whole, you flagged double digit, which I guess is sort of 10% to 12%. So, just \\nwondering if there's something specific happening later towards the end of 2026 that's causing a sort of big \\njump up in profitability or perhaps whether I'm just being a bit too pessimistic on assuming that double digit \\nmeans 10% to 12%? And then second, on distribution. We have the details in terms of what you want to do on the dividend this year, also the comments you've made on buybacks for 2024 and for 2025, but I was just \\nthinking about how you think about the overall payout ratio longer term,  2026 onwards, and the split in that \\nbetween dividends and buybacks.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nHey, Chris. So, on the first, I think what's that dynamic is effectively the benefit of having the full year of 2026 absorb all the savings that, you know, we're working super hard at to achieve over the next two to \\nthree years. So, during the course of 2026, we're still going to be taking significant cost out. In particular, the \\nexpectation is more in the middle and back office where, as I mentioned, you know, things are sequenced a \\nbit. You know, we have to get the client tech decommissioning done and you'll start to see sort of a lot of the \\nmiddle and back office functions, including semi -owned, where we'll see more of the cost take- out in the \\nlatter part of the journey. And so, what you're seeing really priced in at the end of 226 is the full harvesting,  \\neffectively the complete cost income story whereas in 2026 in -year, of course, you know, you're just having \\nthe averaging effect over the course of the year.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nYes, Chris. On buyback, of course, in 2026 we're going to have to factor in different considerations. But \\ngenerally speaking, I would say that we want to continue to have a good mix. I think that our progressive \\ndividend policy is extremely unlikely to cha nge over the long term. So, I think that we want to continue to \\ndeliver a cash dividend growth every year. The pace will be a function as well of where the stock trades, \\nright? So, I mean, at the end of the day, there is an element of balancing cash versus  stock depending on \\nwhere the stock trades.  \\n \\n Page 20 of 32 \\n Having said that, I do recognize that also from a prudential and capital management standpoint of view, \\nshare buybacks offers more flexibility, right? So, what we want to always make sure that our cash dividend is \\nsacrosanct and our progressive policy is a lso very, very important. Therefore, we always want to measure this \\nin two ways. Our dividend will be then benchmark also in respect of making sure that we have an attractive \\nstory for more yield focused equity investors.  \\nJeremy Sigee,  BNP Paribas Exane  \\nThank you. And apologies, my video is not working actually so I'm audio only. So, sorry for that. Two \\nquestions if I could. So, I think what you said about RWA reductions is very welcome, you know, and the \\ntarget of $510 billion in the medium term and that frees up a lot of capital, which is really great to hear. \\nYou've talked about optimization outside Non- core, so within the core divisions, and I just wonder if you \\ncould sort of talk about that a bit more.  Just give us some examples of the kind of lazy assets that you think \\nyou can cut. So, that's my first question.  \\nThe second one is back on the capital returns. You talked about 2024 and you talked about 2026 on the \\nbuybacks and I just wondered in terms of how we think about what you might be able to do in 2025. Is 14% \\nCET1 the relative – the relevant thresholds? Are there other constraints that will constrain you in terms of \\nwhat buybacks you can do in 2025? So, does it have to wait for the Swiss integrations to be done? Does it \\nhave to wait for  non-core milestones? If you  just could talk about the constraints that wo uld affect that, that \\nwould be great.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nOkay. Hi, Jeremy. So, on the first in terms of RWA reduction, you were looking for examples in terms of \\noptimization in the core. So, I'd say, you know, the classic example would be where on, say, on the Credit \\nSuisse side. In Wealth Management, to give an  example, we are inheriting a situation where there was just \\nsay a loan relationship between the bank and a client. And perhaps, you know, we weren't bringing to bear \\nthe holistic client array of services that is our expectation to sort of do. Now, it's be en the blueprint for us in \\nUBS. GWM. And so, that's just an example where you have kind of a monoline is a simple example of that. \\nAnother example could be pricing. So, you might not be getting the pricing for the risks that you're effectively \\ntaking with respect to that financing. So, I think those are two examples where, you know, we need to do \\nwork to ensure the holistic client coverage is brought to bear in a given situation or we're looking at pricing \\nopportunities in particular cases.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nYeah , Jeremy , in respect of share buyback in 2025, I think it's a little bit early to discuss that. But I would say \\nthat first of all, the integration, the Swiss topic , is a 2024 matter. So, by mid -2024 or during 2024 latest, we \\nknow exactly how we manage the integration of the parent company, the US entities and the Swiss \\noperation. That will so in 2025 is unlikely to play a role in our capital return policies. The 14% is a good \\nassumption. And what  we mean by around 14% means 13.8% to 14.2%, not 14.5%. When we have excess \\ncapital, well above the 14% is because we are creating the buffer to do share buyback, to offset temporary \\ntiming differences between cost to achieve in our integration journey and the savings we realize and have the \\nnecessary buffer to a lso phase in the reduction of our tax rate.   \\nSo, in a sense, nothing really changes but we do indeed expect also the underlying profitability to improve, \\nand therefore potentially giving us more flexibility. But this is something that we will focus in exactly 12 \\nmonths' time and we will communicate our plans for 2025.  \\n \\n Page 21 of 32 \\n Jeremy Sigee,  BNP Paribas Exane  \\nThat's great. Thanks very much.  \\nAndrew Coombs , Citigroup  \\nGood morning. Thank you for taking my questions. So, the first one would just be going back to some of the \\nmath that Kian outlined at the start. I'm just trying to understand your decision- making process. So, if you \\nlook at slide 20, I think you said the 9% revenue to RWA post -Basel IV. So, you're suggesting exit run rate \\n$46 billion of revenues, 70 % cost income, $ 32 billion of costs and that's a couple of billion below the full \\nyear 2026 consensus revenues and full year 2026 costs , appreciate w e’re comparing exit versus full year \\nthere. But with that in mind, could you elaborate on where you've identified the additional cost opportunities \\ngiven that you previously said  $10 billion, you're now at $13 billion and you're on the tape of saying we are \\nsacrificing some topline growth in order to enhance returns. So also , where you've made the decision to \\nperhaps come out of some product areas where there was a revenue opportunity? That's the first question.  \\nSecond question is on capital return. Again, trying to run the numbers, $510 billion RWAs, 14% core Tier 1. You need to be, on that basis, $71.5 billion in core Tier 1 capital. You're at $78 billion today. So, already a lot \\nof excess capital there , then there's the retained earnings coming through. So, just trying to understand. Are \\nthere any other moving parts aside from that amortization in the  FINMA  waiver between tangible equity and \\ncore Tier 1 capital over the next three to four years? Thank you.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nSo, I'll let Todd take the questions and only noting that you may have got the revenues wrong, but you may \\naddress this issue.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nOkay. Yes. So, Andy, hey. I will just go on the cost side because I think I addressed the revenue side anyway in \\nresponse to Kian. I would –  I'd also – it's also important to point out just quickly on that slide that as we say in \\nthere, it's pre -impact from the Basel III final and model update so that, you know, also will impact on the \\nreturn of RWA.  \\nIn terms of the additional cost opportunities that we found, as you asked, I mean, first, I would say we're just \\nconfirming what we said last year about greater than $10 billion and saying we had to go do the work to \\nvalidate all the details.  And so, you know, the $13 billion that we've come out with, neither Sergio nor I think \\nthat that's, you know, going further. It was for us always the neighborhood of where, you know, we thought the plan – the detailed bottom -up plans would get us. And ulti mately, when we were communicating greater \\nthan $10 billion, you know, that was an informed estimate of course because we had done a fair bit of work. \\nBut of course, all the work that we've done over the last three months validating that, you know, that \\nnumber. So, tha t's sort of the first thing is just important to emphasize that it's not as if we've gone deeper. \\nBut in terms – so on that basis, I would just say that the $13 billion remains for us on a gross basis, critical. \\nYou know, w e said half is going to be personnel related. Half is – the other half will be consisting comprised \\nof things like mainly tech but also real estate, also third party costs.  So, again, it's a validation of what we've \\ndone and also as I highlighted going through the trajectories, giving you a sense of when we think these will \\nhead through.  \\n \\n Page 22 of 32 \\n And just quickly on the – you asked about, you know, sacrificing topline growth. I think the point that both \\nSergio and I have made is just of course  when you do a financial resource optimization work, and we've done \\nthis before, you know, naturally to reduce the balance sheet means at times, well, you know, you're going to \\nbe sacrificing revenues as assets come down. And so, you know, it all comes  down to the accretion of return \\non CET1 ultimately and how we think about this in terms of trade -offs. So, tha t's how I would respond to \\nthat. \\nAnd then I think you were saying any other differences, if I took your point on CET1 and tangible equity. Was that the point that you were making the differences, I think you were saying, Andy.  \\nAndrew Coombs , Citigroup  \\nIt's exactly that. Just trying to get with the capital build. Thank you.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nYes. Well, I was just pointing out in terms of convergence, as I highlighted, you know, historically one of the \\nbig differentiators between CET1, which we think , by the way , is the right is the right model anyway because \\nthat's the basis for being able to buy back shares and pay dividends, so we think , you know,  measuring return \\non CET1 capital is right. But we know there's always interest in that CET1 versus TE. So, what I was just \\nsuggesting was that our – as our tax loss DTAs, which were one of the big differentiators, are amortizing \\ndown and being converted into temp difference DTAs which are CET1 accretive, that that becomes much less \\nof a delta and therefore, you know, signals a move towards convergence.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nYeah, Maybe let me just add quickly to your comment on driving optimization of the balance sheet and \\nreturn on risk -weighted assets. You mentioned if we are planning to exit products, I have to say that, you \\nknow, never say never because in the next two or three years, you never know  how developments work out. \\nBut at this stage, everything that we don ’t deem  as a product that we want to have is part of non -core. So, \\nit's all about repricing the existing core relationship s and businesses. It's not about exiting businesses. I mean, \\nI'm talking about meaningful businesses, of course, right? So, I don't expect – it's really and that's the reason \\nwhy it's not an immediate effect because we have to manage the relationship. We have to manage the discussion with clients in a way that they unde rstand risk -reward for us, for them. They understand the value \\nof the advice we give to clients, the services and products we give.  We also have to make sure that, you \\nknow, where applicable, we stop having discounts. And so, this is over time, of course, is going to help to close the gap.  \\nAndrew Coombs , Citigroup  \\nThat's great. Perhaps I could just follow -up on the opening remark, I think you said my revenue calculation \\nwas wrong on slide 20. The $510 billion I think is post -Basel IV and in the footnote you said 9% post -Basel IV \\nfinalization model update. So, should we be taking $510 billion times the 9% or $510 billion times the 10% \\non the slide? Just to be clear.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nWell, it would be $510 billion times the 9% since that would be the return inclusive of the – so that's apples \\nand apples.  \\n \\n Page 23 of 32 \\n Andrew Coombs , Citigroup  \\nBrilliant. Thank you.  \\nAnke Reingen , RBC \\nYeah. Sorry. Hopefully that works. If you can talk about the path from the 15% to the 18% in 2028 return \\non core Tier 1 capital. Given you had 15% to 18% before, so how conservative is the timing as well as the \\n18% compared to your previous range and how much is at self -help versus market? And the second question \\nis a Q4 question. Your net fee generating assets were negative in Q4. If you can maybe e laborate a bit on \\nwhat's been driving this? Thank you.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nAnke, I'll take this one. I think – and you take the second, Todd. I guess on the exit rate, we are trying to \\nmodel what the potential will be and I outline that we can definitely converge back into a level of value \\ncreation that is in the middle range since maybe it's also appropriate to remember that if we wanted to really \\nreiterate the old story, we would have talked about 15% to 18%., and what we are saying is that we believe \\nthe exit rate is 18%. So, I believe that the combined story over time will deliver a better, more stable, less \\nvolatile returns and those returns will be in the mid of that range between, you know, from above 15%, \\naround 18%.  \\nSo, I would say that's the nuances of the changes are the one I just mentioned. So, we are not talking about \\n15% to 18%. I believe that we are well -positioned to be sustainably in the high teens going forward. I don't \\nthink there is a level of being conser vative five years ahead. We need to really work out the execution of the \\nphase and understand what is the potential, and over time we will fine tune short -term ambitions.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nAnd Anke, on the net new fee generating assets in the quarters, you mentioned they were negative. Just to \\nunpack that a bit. We saw good NNFGA on the UBS platform. What you see a bit is more the Credit Suisse \\ndynamic in terms of mandates on the Credit Suisse platform and i n the fact that there was a net outflow of \\nmandates that also could be as well from relationship managers who have left. We are countering that by \\nvirtue of having now have an aligned CIO view and aligned solutions and offerings that we're  bringing out to \\nboth – on both platforms. So, we expect going forward that, you know, the CS mandates that perhaps we \\nwere seeing a bit less of tha n ideal. We should be able to stem that issue a bit going forward from an NNFGA \\nperspective.  \\nAnke Reingen, RBC \\nThank you.  \\nAlastair Ryan , Bank of America  \\nYeah. Okay. Apologies. Technology is not my specialty . $100 billion net new assets in 2024 and 2025 but \\nthat feels like about dividends and interest given the shape of the balance sheet you provide in the slides. So, \\ncould you just talk – just expand a little bit on what else the underlying outflow s assumptions you're making \\nperhaps on some of the relationships you took over with Credit Suisse whether that's case? And secondly, \\n \\n Page 24 of 32 \\n cash, now 18% of the balance sheet. Very, very high liquidity coverage ratio. Is that something that's just the \\nnew run rate or can you bring that down as you complete the complex legal entity restructuring? Thank you.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nHey, Alastair, I'll take those. So, on your first on net new assets, you know, the $100 billion over the next two \\nyears just reflects the fact that, you know, to the point that I think we've been making that while we're going \\nto continue to grow the asset base, I mean, $100 billion is still $100 billion over the next – each of the next \\ntwo years, $200 billion by the end of 2025 and that's a focus of the team. In terms of where we think, you \\nknow, the appropriate ambition would be, normally when we're just i n growth – full growth mode and not \\nlooking to also ensure that, you know, appropriate hygiene on the balance sheet, that's reflecting that discount in there  a bit. We still think it's a strong number. It's still growing the asset base.  It's still providing a \\nbasis to grow our revenues, as I highlighted in my comments, but it is reflecting the fact that in addition to \\ngrowing client relationships and bringing more and more aligned products and solutions to our clients, there \\nare going to be situations, as w e both highlighted, where, you know, perhaps we see potential outflows  \\nbecause of decisions we've made around given service for example, trying to a price alone, potentially \\nunsuccessfully, and then seeing that roll off and then potentially the collateral moving out of the bank as a \\nresult. So, it's just appropriate to price in some of that as we do this, you know, good and necessary work to \\nensure ultimately stronger return on RWA and sustainably higher returns in the long run.  \\nIn terms of cash or the HQLA that we have, yeah, you could assume going forward that that is structurally our \\nrun rate for now just given the new Swiss liquidity ordinance requirements that we're complying with. So, you \\ncan assume that that's right. Natura lly, we're focusing on, you know, winning back deposits and continuing \\ndiversified sources of funding, not least given the structural funding gap we've inherited from the Credit \\nSuisse subsidiary in Switzerland. So, you know, we're taking steps in our fund ing plan to narrow that. But in \\nthe end, you can assume that for now, that level of liquidity is sort of run rate level.  \\nAlastair Ryan , Bank of America  \\nThank you.  \\nGiulia Miotto , Morgan Stanley  \\nHi. Good morning. You hear me well?  Okay, perfect. So, my first question goes to GWM Americas. I think the \\ntarget is low teens until 2026 and then up to mid- teens PBT margin. So, what strategic options are you taking \\nto structurally lift profitability in this division? I think I heard this – rebuilding the banking platform in- house, \\nbut if you can give us more color on that. So that's my first longer -term question. Whereas on the short term, \\nin terms of transaction margins, those are being subdued for a whi le and especially in Asia. What evidence \\nare you seeing or are you seeing any evidence of that coming back? Thank you.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nYeah. Hi, Giulia. So, on – in terms of the sorts of investments we're making, as you mentioned, you know, we \\nthink the core banking infrastructure work is critical because that effectively institutionalizes clients much more effectively in doing that. The more that you have a broader suite of products and capabilities to offer clients, the more in effect it becomes, you know, they become stickier. The clients and the advisors just \\nbecome stickier. We  know that playbook. We run that playbook in every part of  the world outside the US. \\nAnd so, it's something that for us is quite fundamental. And so, we're going to continue to do that and \\n \\n Page 25 of 32 \\n continue to invest in digital capabilities to make being both a client and an advisor of the US business of \\nGWM better.  \\nThere are also some other things that we're doing to bring that profit margin up. Sergio mentioned in his \\ncomments. A lot of it's also about products and capabilities and we're seeing that start to hit through. And \\nthat's just in terms of, again, borrowing  a page from the playbook that we use outside the US, it's the global \\nmarkets approach. So, it's having a more join t GWM -Investment Bank approach to serving clients from a \\ntransactional perspective, especially clients with more sophisticated needs, also from a lending perspective as \\nwell, having more of a focus on lending solutions as we've done outside the US as well. So, I think doing all that is where we think, you know, just doing the sort of good blocking and tackling will, you know, should \\nsupport the  profit margin in mid -teens over the next two to three years.  \\nIn terms of transaction margins in APAC, yeah, I think we are seeing – we actually saw some good \\nperformance in the fourth quarter from a TRX perspective, in particular on the UBS platform, which is \\nencouraging. So, we're – and also in APAC. Again, given j ust our diversification in the region, we're not just \\nlimited to, you know, one location potentially underperforming from an equity markets perspective, and we \\nactually saw a good performance in the region. In particular, we saw good performance in transac tions in \\nJapan this quarter. And so, you know, we have the good, diversified approach to ensure that even if one – as \\nI said, one particular part of the region isn't generating the sorts of margins that are ideal for us that we're \\nable to compensate.  \\nGiulia Miotto, Morgan Stanley  \\nThanks.  \\nStefan Stalmann , Autonomous  \\nYes. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the presentation and for taking my questions. I hope you can hear \\nme well. I wanted to first ask on the share buyback restart this year. I was a bit surprised that you make this \\nlink between the legal entity merger o f the parent banks and the ability to restart the share buyback. Do you \\nsee actually a direct link there between Group payout capacity and what happens to the parent bank merger \\nor is it just a short form for you to say if the merger works, that's a good i ndication that the integration is \\nonline, and that's why I can go back to share buybacks?  \\nAnd the second question is on capital requirements. You have obviously presented the plan very much on the \\nbasis of the rules as they currently stand, but we also have an upcoming review by the government and we \\ndon't know how that looks like. On a confide nce scale of 1 to 10, where do you think the outcome will be? \\nDo you think your numbers will still be proven fine after this review or do you think it could change? Thank you. \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nThank you, Stefan. I think the link between share buyback and the parent bank merger and the underlying U S \\noperation and later on, the Swiss one, it's very relevant because if we have a delay, our ability to start to deliver on the cost synergies will come just later. And therefore, we would lose capital buffers that we believe is necessary. So, I think it's totally there is no gaming or nothing. It's just prudent reasonable way to look at \\nthe two major risks associated with such an integration is regulator y approvals to execute legal entity \\nmergers. We are talking about 50 -plus countries. Okay? And the second one is IT migration. This is probably \\nmore the 2024 into 2025 as we start to migrate. So, if we don't get into a good place with our parent \\n \\n Page 26 of 32 \\n company merger by the end of the second quarter, we have a delayed effect which has to be reflected in our \\nprudence in terms of how we accrue capital. So, I hope this is very clear now.  \\nIn terms of capital requirements, yeah, well, I mean, I can only say, you know, watch and listen to what has \\nbeen said publicly by different international and domestic experts around the topic of capital and why Credit \\nSuisse failed. Credit Suisse didn't fail because of lack of capital or lack of liquidity per se but it failed because, \\nyou know, partially, I would say the loss of trust and confidence, the lack of underlying profitability and that \\ncreated a self -fulfilling problem. I think if you look at regulation, you know, the regulation was well applied \\nand fully functioning for UBS. So, the same regulation should have worked for Credit Suisse.  \\nI do think that – I'm pretty convinced that any authorities and governments, before taking actions on capital, \\nthey will also have to sit down and look at what happened, like the commission that is investigating on the \\nmatter is doing, and everybody will have to pose and think about what they could have done better, being a \\nlittle bit more self -critical about what happened. So, I believe the current regime and no experts is saying that \\nmore capital is necessary. So, I'm not going to give you an answer on my rating of confidence because there \\nis only downside on that, but I can only tell you that facts are telling us a crystal clear story that capital is not \\nthe way to manage such a situation.  \\nStefan Stalmann, Autonomous  \\nVery clear. Thank you very much.  \\nAdam Terelak, Mediobanca  \\nMorning. Thank you for the questions. I've got three on capital, one of which is a clarification. I wanted to dig into slide 36, the $15 billion of balance sheet optimization. Clearly, it's talking about net of gross as well. So, \\ncan we get a feeling for w hat the underlying moving parts are because it's clearly going in different directions \\nand whether there's any kind of regulatory securitization type benefit to think about, say non- revenue costing \\nRWA  efficiencies to think about on the forward look. And t hen linked to that, clearly the lower RWA outlook \\nhas created lots of flexibility in your plan, but how do you guys think about redeploying your balance sheet if there are profitable growth opportunities particularly given that your stock is trading above tangible book or \\nCET1?  \\nAnd then just a clarification. On the AT1 buildout, it says increasing to 18% by 2029 but I think you \\nreferenced 2026 as well in terms of that Tier 1 capital requirement. So, if you just give us color on the AT1 \\nbuildout timeline would be very helpful. Tha nk you.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nSo, let me – thanks for that, Adam. Let me just cover. The last one is 2029 because that's, you know, that is \\nhow we've modeled and also just given the way our expectations are on the Too Big To Fail  requirements \\ncoming in impacting on going concern capital out until 2030. So, that is the correct read. In terms of the first \\nquestion on slide 36, so the $510 billion effectively where we think we get to, of course, is net of growth. So, \\nthere is a growth that is priced in. So, the fact that we have, say, bala nce sheet optimization in the core \\nbusinesses, we say net of growth.  So, these are trade- offs that we're making and look, we've done this \\nbefore and it's, you know, taking the balance sheet in areas where there are opportunities to generate greater returns on RWA. That's the work that we're doing,  and obviously where there are opportunities to \\ngrow especially to start to begin to harvest the combination and the scale that we have. Clearly, that will be \\nthe case.  \\n \\n Page 27 of 32 \\n Sergio P. Ermotti  \\nYeah, I guess a 5% return on risk -weighted assets is not acceptable, right? So, I think that's the reason I'm \\nsaying it makes no sense for us to try to overly impress anybody with growth on the top line if this is just \\ndestroying value or not sustainable. So, we are willing to take a step back in terms of growth. But still in some \\nareas, are we going to grow? Now, It's very important to understand the restructuring element up until the \\nend of 2026. Afterwards, we will grow. Of course, we will grow. So, we a re not a restructuring story. We will \\ngrow again because our business will grow but from a base that I believe is going to be much more reliable and sustainable.  \\nAdam Terelak, Mediobanca  \\nCould I have a follow -up in terms of what volume of RWA are sitting below kind of your aspiration in terms \\nof RoRWA? Just trying to size the opportunity in terms of recycling your risk weights into high growth.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nWell, you look at the balance sheet of Credit Suisse that we onboarded has revenues on risk- weighted assets \\nof 5% on average in 2022. Now, we are already taking actions but this is the volume you have to think \\nabout. So, we were perfectly happy with the return profiles of our Wealth Management and IB and Swiss \\nbank operation. So, we need to now bring it back. And I think it is very important that, you know, it's all \\nabout giving clear directions to our people. Our new colleagues from Credit Suisse fully understand that they \\nare now following what they believe also is the best way to create value for clients – for shareholders, but \\nalso for clients because we want to be predictable. We want to be a partner that is there and where the \\nrelationship allows us to  tell what are our expectations and what is the client expectations, and that we'll \\nneed to be addressed and we now have a clear, aligned way of looking at how to develop and grow the business.  \\nAdam Terelak, Mediobanca  \\nRight. Thank you very much.  \\nBenjamin  Goy, Deutsche Bank  \\nYes. Hi. Good morning. Two questions, please, one on the Global Wealth Management and one on \\nInvestment Bank. If  you can add a bit more color on the $100 billion net new asset run rate that should rise to \\n$200 billion per year by 2028. So, just wondering how much is reduced impact from business exits or kind of \\nrisk appetite, financial advisor leaving, and then how much is, say, acceleration of the platform of a unified \\nplatform? And then secondly, sounds like the Credit Suisse b ankers you onboarded , pretty  low revenues so \\nfar. It's picking up the next one to two years. I was just wondering because you mentioned for the market s \\nposition that it will be transferred end of Q1, but you also feel that in sales and trading, the Credit Suisse \\ncolleagues you onboarded have been underearning and whether they  could see an acceleration this year. \\nThank you.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nHi, Ben. So, in terms of the run rate of net new assets from $100 billion, I would say as Sergio just highlighted \\nin response to the last question, you know, we for sure will grow. And once we feel like the balance sheet is \\nin a better spot, we think that that will build quickly in terms of, you know, us focusing on growth. So, the \\n \\n Page 28 of 32 \\n bridge to $200 billion, while we're not disclosing specifically what we think the numbers are, you can expect \\nthat, you know, certainly in 2026 we should start to see that come up pretty significantly and then build to \\n$200 billion by 2028. So, I would say  it's not necessarily just, you know, linear straight line. We should see a \\nbit of an acceleration early on in 2026, but I think there's some hard yards that we have modeled in to get to \\nthe $200 billion in the latter part of that five -year cycle.  \\nIn terms of IB productivity on the market s side, I mean, one of the key points that I highlighted was, you \\nknow, actually onboarding on the market s side, fully onboarding not only the traders but their positions, \\nwhich is now – it's been 4Q but really it's an intense piece of work in 1Q where we expect the majority of the \\npositions to then be onboarded on UBS infrastructure. Once that happens, you know, we think that the \\nmarkets personnel should be able to start generating, you know, appropriate revenues. Y es, there's a ramp, \\nbut it's not the same as in on the banking side where that productivity is going to take a longer ramp as you \\nmight appreciate it, but we should see and we expect that we'll see better productivity pretty quickly once the \\npositions are onboarded on to the UBS infrastructure.  \\nBenjamin Goy, Deutsche Bank  \\nUnderstood. Thank you.  \\nTom Hallett , KBW  \\nMorning. Yeah. Hi, guys. So, most of my questions have been answered, but just maybe going back to NII. You say it will grow again in the second half of the planning period. Am I right in just assuming that's the \\nsecond half of 2025? So, i.e., kind of NII should decline three to early 2025? And then secondly, you know, \\none of your peers in the US said that deposit mix changes were kind of ending. Is that what you're seeing as \\nwell? And could you maybe just clarify the wider international business , what's going on with deposit mix \\nchanges there or what you expect going forward? Thanks.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nSure. Hey, Tom. So, in terms of NII, yeah, we see the recovery coming from more mid 2025. So that's correct,  \\nthat's the right read. So, you know, again, just given how we're pricing in rate reductions, you know, \\nwhether they come, I think as you know the different views. But whether they come over 12 months or 18 \\nmonths, we're running our models, but we definite ly have rate reductions before we see stability, you know, \\ninto 2025 for sure. And then that stability then corresponds as well with what we think would be a pick -up in \\nloan volumes and loan revenues overall on top of, of course, the funding efficiencies t hat I talked about at \\nlength during my comments that really start to accelerate the recovery in NII in the latter part of the or the \\nsecond half effectively of the three -year planning cycle.  \\nIn terms of deposit mix effects, absolutely. We've seen a tapering in the US. We started seeing even last quarter , even in 3Q, we're seeing that continue to taper. Still seeing a little bit of that, though, where there's \\nspillover and higher rates in some of the non- US dollar currencies in particular in Switzerland. So, we're still \\nseeing a bit of deposit mix shifts, bu t we sort of price them more or less out of our outlook, you know, once \\nwe get beyond 1Q. And in terms of how that looks across I think the US, we're now – we've seen stability \\nfirst time since 4Q 2021 that we've had net deposit inflows so that's good. In APAC, we've actually seen \\nsome good deposit inflows also not least just given win- back.  So, there's that impact as well. And in \\nSwitzerland, we're seeing a bit of a slightly downward move in terms of deposit inflows. So, just to give you a \\nsense of sort of the deposit volume as I see it across the spectrum.  \\n \\n Page 29 of 32 \\n Tom Hallett, KBW  \\nThat's very clear. Thank you.  \\nAndrew Lim,  Société Géneral e \\nFantastic. Thanks for taking my questions. So, the first one, on capital. I'm really trying to square your RWA \\nguidance with how you feel about buybacks. So, looking at that equation, you know, that $510 billion on \\nRWAs, obviously quite low versus consensus. But if you take consensus capital of, say, $80 billion, $81 bi llion, \\nthen you are looking at about 15.8% CET1 ratio. So, we even get to the conclusion that your buyback \\npotential is quite a lot higher than what you've indicated or maybe your expectation for CET1 capital is maybe materially lower than $81 billion. So,  I just wanted to see how you feel about that.  \\nAnd then the second question is on the NII guidance that you've given. Obviously, we've drill down into the \\ndeposit mix shift  there . But you’ ve noted that one of your competitors are also one of the big drivers there \\nhas been deleveraging of Lombard  loans and I wanted to see if that was actually a big driver for yourselves as \\nwell and how this has impacted your thoughts on NII for this year and going forward?  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nYeah. Thanks. Thanks for that, Andrew. So, I'll take – on the second one, no, we're not seeing – I mean, \\nwe've had some deleveraging that we've highlighted in prior quarters but we're not seeing that as a major \\nfactor in our guidance at this point other than around the impacts from the resource optimization that I've \\nhighlighted. But in particular around Lombard deleveraging, we're not pricing that to any significant degree \\ninto our guidance. And I was just trying to pick up on your first point where you we re, sorry, you were trying \\nto square if – where the RWA levels are in terms of how that informs the way you want to think about share \\nbuybacks ? I just want to understand your point if you can repeat them.  \\nAndrew Lim, Société Générale  \\nYes. So, let ’s say we ’re taking that consensus of $81 billion CET1 capital, you’ ve indicated $510 billion on \\nRWA. So, that would be 15.9% CET1 ratio. So, actually it is quite a lot of buffer, maybe $5 billion or so above \\n$5.5 billion buybacks that you might be pointing towards for 2026. So, you know, there ’s either a lot more \\ncapacity for you to actually push up your buybacks there or maybe you’ re thinking that CET1 capital might be \\na bit lower than what consensus think. So, I just want to see what you thin k about  it. \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nYeah, I think – okay. Clear. So, yeah, I think in terms of your CET1 capital calculations, I'm not sure that \\nsquares with how we model under one baseline scenario. But I think it's fair to say that, you know, if we \\ngenerate as we go out to 2026, the extent  to which we're able to generate the returns that we expect to \\ngenerate at the end of 2026, that there will be sufficient capacity, as Sergio said, to be able to undertake as \\nmuch share buybacks as we had, in fact, more so than pre -acquisition levels. So, I think, you know, I won't \\ncomment specifically on whether your CET1 number is the same number we consider under one scenario but I think it's fair to say that there is share buyback capacity naturally if we hit these targets that we've set out.  \\nAndrew Lim, Société Générale  \\nGreat. Thanks.  \\n \\n Page 30 of 32 \\n Nicolas Payen , Kepler Chevreux  \\nYes. Morning. I have two questions, please. Two on Wealth Management. The first one would be on your \\npre-tax profit margin targets in the US. You're targeting mid -teens by 2026 and still significantly below what \\nyour US peers are doing. So, I wanted to know what kind of levers you can pull through to have this \\nconvergence towards the profitability levels that we are seeing of the US peers. And the second one will be \\non the net inflow that you are targeting. Is there any geographies where you see the most potential or where \\nyou are the most excited about where you – where the CS merger is bringing new capabilities and new \\noutlook? Thank you.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nYeah. Thanks, Nicolas. So, on the – look, on the pre -tax profit, you know, as we've laid out, I think Sergio in \\nhis prepared comments and mine in response to a question earlier, you know, we're building back to mid-\\nteens through the work that we've describ ed, which we think is quite important at that point in time, getting \\nto what we think is an appropriate level given, you know, where we are now. Then at that stage, we have, \\nyou know, options to consider beyond that to narrow the gap further, and that's ce rtainly the plan. So, you \\nknow, it's a little bit of w alk before we run and we wanted to just be clear that we, you know, the things that \\nwe think that need to happen in the US business that we ’re going to do over the next three years will set us \\nup for success and being able to sort of then , at that stage , drive greater returns and narrow the gap further \\nbeyond 2026.  \\nIn terms of the geographies in GWM that we're excited about, I mean, just off the top , and I've talked about \\nthis before, but certainly places where we become really meaningful, we're excited about many places that \\nthe CS integration brings to bear on Wealth. But, you know, when it comes to minor places where , \\nmeaningfully , change is what we had in the particular region just given maybe a focus on different client \\nsegments, maybe we exited. So, two examples come to mind would be Brazil, more on the former i n terms of \\nthe client segment we focused on. Another is Australia where we exited , again more of an affluent practice \\nthat we had many years ago , and we have an opportunity now to inherit a business in Australia aligned, by \\nthe way, with the IB in Australia which is quite exciting. And that business is more, you know, the high net worth and the ultra that is our bread and butter.  So, two examples where , and for different reasons of what \\nexcites us in terms of the acquisition.  \\nNicolas Payen, Kepler Chevreux  \\nThank you.  \\nPiers Brown , HSBC  \\nYeah. Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered, but maybe just a final one on litigation. \\nJust whether there's anything in the plan for a sort of a business as usual normalized charge for litigation. I \\nknow you've taken a lot of adjustments  on CS acquisition and you've gotten the $4 billion of balance sheet \\nreserves at this stage , but having had a good chance to look at the case book at this point. Is there anything \\nin there which you think might still burden the P&L over the course of the targets that you ’ve laid out this \\nmorning? Thanks.  \\n  \\n \\n Page 31 of 32 \\n Todd Tuckner  \\nHey, Piers. Thanks for the question. Yeah, I mean, just refer you to the litigation note which, you know, gives \\nboth the UBS heritage and Credit Suisse heritage legacies there, say that's the best bet. Otherwise, I ’ll just tell \\nyou that our provision levels are augmented by the PPA that I described in August. We're comfortable with \\nthe levels we're at just given the – where those matters sit, but that's, you know, all I would comment in \\nterms of litigation at this stag e. \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nI won't abuse of your patience. You have been with us, thank you, for 2 hours -plus. Thanks for the questions. \\nThanks for attending. I hope you got enough information. But most importantly, if you have any further \\nneeds or any further questions, please reac h out to Sarah's team, IR, or I'm sure between myself and Todd , \\nwe'll have a chance to catch -up with many of you in the next few weeks.  \\nThank you for attending and enjoy the rest of the day. Thank you.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n Page 32 of 32 \\n Cautionary statement regarding forward -looking statements \\nThis transcript contains statements that constitute “forward-looking statements,” including but not limited to management’s outlook for UBS’s financial \\nperformance, statements relating to the  anticipated effect of transactions and strategic initiatives on UBS’s business and future development and goals or \\nintentions to achieve climate, sustainability and other social objectives. While these forward -looking statements represent UBS’s judgments, expectations  \\nand objectives concerning the matters described, a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors could cause act ual developments and results \\nto differ materially from UBS’s expectations. In particular, terrorist activity and conflicts in the M iddle East, as  well as the continuing Russia –Ukraine war, \\nmay have significant impacts on global markets, exacerbate global inflationary pressures, and slow global growth. In addition, the ongoing conflicts may \\ncontinue to cause significant population displacement, and l ead to shortages of vital commodities, including energy shortages and food insecurity outside \\nthe areas immediately involved in armed conflict. Governmental responses to the armed conflicts, including, with respect to t he Russia –Ukraine war, \\ncoordinated successiv e sets of  sanctions on Russia and Belarus, and Russian and Belarusian entities and nationals, and the uncertainty as to whether the \\nongoing conflicts will widen and intensify, may continue to have significant adverse effects on the market and macroeconomic condition s, including in ways \\nthat cannot be anticipated. UBS’s acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group has materially changed our outlook and strategic dir ection and introduced new \\noperational challenges. The integration of the Credit Suisse entities into the UBS structure is  expected to take between three and five years and presents \\nsignificant risks, including the risks that UBS Group AG may be unable to achieve the cost reductions and other benefits contemplated by the transaction. This creates significantly greater uncertainty about  forward- looking statements. Other factors that may affect our performance and ability to achieve our \\nplans, outlook and other objectives also include, but are not limited to: (i) the degree to which UBS is successful in the ex ecution of its strategic plans , \\nincluding its  cost reduction and efficiency initiatives and its ability to manage its levels of risk -weighted assets (RWA) and leverage ratio denominator (LRD), \\nliquidity coverage ratio and other financial resources, including changes in RWA assets and liabilities arisi ng from higher  market volatility and the size of the \\ncombined Group; (ii) the degree to which UBS is successful in implementing changes to its businesses to meet changing market,  regulatory and other \\nconditions, including as a result of the acquisition of the Credit Suis se Group;  (iii) increased inflation and interest rate volatility in major markets; (iv) \\ndevelopments in the macroeconomic climate and in the markets in which UBS operates or to which it is exposed, including movem ents in securities prices \\nor liquidity, credit spreads, currency  exchange rates, deterioration or slow recovery in residential and commercial real estate markets, the effects of economic \\nconditions, including increasing inflationary pressures, market developments, increasing geopolitical tensions, and changes t o national trade  policies on the \\nfinancial position or creditworthiness of UBS’s clients and counterparties, as well as on client sentiment and levels of activity; (v) changes in the availability of capital and funding, including any adverse changes in UBS’s credit spreads  and credit ratings  of UBS, Credit Suisse, sovereign issuers, structured credit \\nproducts or credit -related exposures, as well as availability and cost of funding to meet requirements for debt eligible for total loss- absorbing capacity \\n(TLAC), in particular in light of the acq uisition of the Credit  Suisse Group; (vi) changes in central bank policies or the implementation of financial legislation \\nand regulation in Switzerland, the US, the UK, the EU and other financial centers that have imposed, or resulted in, or may do so in the future, more stringe nt or entity- specific  capital, TLAC, leverage ratio, net stable funding ratio, liquidity and funding requirements, heightened operational resilience \\nrequirements, incremental tax requirements, additional levies, limitations on permitted activities, constraints on remuneration,  constraints on transfers of \\ncapital and liquidity and sharing of operational costs across the Group or other measures, and the effect these will or would  have on UBS’s business activities; \\n(vii) UBS’s ability to successfully implement resolvability and related regulatory requirements and the potential need to make further changes to the legal \\nstructure or booking model of UBS in response to legal and regulatory requirements and any additional requirements due to its  acquisition of the Credit \\nSuisse Group, or other developm ents; (viii) UBS’s ability to maintain and improve its systems and controls for complying with sanctions in a timely manner \\nand for the detection and prevention of money laundering to meet evolving regulatory requirements and expectations, in partic ular in curre nt geopolitical \\nturmoil; (ix) the uncertainty arising from domestic stresses in certain major economies; (x) changes in UBS’s competitive pos ition, including whether \\ndifferences in regulatory capital and other requirements among the major financial centers adversely affect  UBS’s ability to compete in certain lines of \\nbusiness;

Materials and a webcast \\nreplay are available at www.ubs.com/investors   \\n \\n \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\n \\nSlide 3 – Key messages  \\nThank you, Sarah and good morning, everyone.  \\nIt has been a little over a year since the closing of the acquisition.  We  made significant progress and UBS \\ncontinues to deliver on all of its commitments to stakeholders.  \\nPutting the needs of clients first during a challenging market environment has allowed us to maintain solid \\nmomentum while we fulfill our objective of completing the integration by the end of 2026.  As a consequence, \\nnot only we have dramatically reduced the execution risk of the integration,  we are also well positioned to meet \\nall of our financial targets - and return to the level of profitability UBS delivered before being asked to step in \\nand stabilize Credit Suisse.   \\nI am particularly proud to note that across the combined organization our people are embracing the pillars, \\nprinciples and behaviors that drive UBS’s culture.  These include client centricity and collaboration and enable \\nus to successfully manage risk and act with accountability and integrity.   \\nI’d like to thank all my colleagues around the world for their dedication and hard work.  \\nOur second -quarter results contributed to a strong first -half performance, reflecting the strength of our client \\nfranchises and disciplined implementation of our strategy and integration plans.  Reported net profit for the \\nfirst half was 2.9 billion, with underlying PBT of 4.7 billion and an underlying return on CET1 capital of 9.2%.  \\nWe strengthened our capital position and maintained a balance sheet for all seasons, with a CET1 capital ratio \\nof 14.9% and total loss -absorbing capacity of around 200 billion.  Our parent bank is well capitalized, even \\nafter withstanding the removal of si gnificant regulatory concessions previously granted to Credit Suisse.  As a \\nresult, we are executing on our 2024 capital return plans and, as I mentioned last quarter, we are committed \\nto delivering on our mid -to-long term ambitions for dividends and buyba cks. \\n \\n Page 2 of 22 \\n Turning to the integration, we have captured nearly half of our targeted gross cost savings as we restructure \\nour core businesses and wind down Non -core and Legacy, where we have materially reduced risk -weighted \\nassets over the last twelve months.  \\nAs part of our de -risking efforts, we have also made good progress addressing Credit Suisse’s legacy legal \\nissues, including the Supply Chain Finance Funds and Mozambique matters.   \\nFollowing these intense months of execution, during which we obtained more than 180 approvals from roughly \\n80 regulators in more than 40 jurisdictions, we completed the mergers of our parent and Swiss banks, and \\ntransitioned to a single U.S. intermediate h olding company.  \\nThis clears the way for the next set of critical milestones that will support the realization of further integration \\nsynergies.  \\nBut let me reiterate something you’ve heard me say before: We still have a lot of work ahead of us to address \\nCredit Suisse’s structural lack of sustainable profitability.  \\nWhile we are encouraged by the significant progress we have made across the Group, the path to restoring \\nprofitability to the pre -acquisition levels won’t be linear.  \\nWe are now entering the next phase of our integration which will be key to realizing the further substantial \\ncost, capital, funding and tax benefits necessary to deliver on our 2026 financial targets.  \\nWe are following through on our plans amid heightened uncertainties in the markets. These are the moments \\nin which UBS proves its strength, resilience and superior ability to serve and advise clients.  \\nThis is reflected in the trust that our clients have placed in us every quarter since the close, with a total of 127 \\nbillion in net new assets.  \\nWe’ve also remained focused on our strategic objectives to enhance our client offering and leverage the \\nbreadth, scale and synergies of our combined franchises.  \\nIn the Investment Bank, I am pleased by the client response to the strategic additions we have made to reinforce \\nour capabilities and competitive position.  \\nThe first -half performance is a positive signal that the investments are paying off.  In Global Markets we saw \\nthe highest second quarter on record. And in Global Banking we have captured sizeable market share gains. \\nImportantly, we achieved these results without compromising on our risk and capital discipline.  \\nWe are also increasing collaboration across the firm as GWM clients continue to benefit from our IB products \\nand capabilities. This drove the majority of wealth management’s expansion of client activity this year, \\nparticularly in the Americas and APAC.  \\nAnother example is our newly created Unified Global Alternatives unit which combines our Alternatives \\ninvestment capabilities across GWM and Asset Management.  \\nIn fact, this is not just an internal cooperation. We are reshaping the competitive landscape by effectively \\ncreating a top -5 global player and Limited Partner with 250 billion in invested assets across hedge funds, private \\nequity, private credit, infrastructure and real estate.   \\n \\n Page 3 of 22 \\n Unified Global Alternatives will offer our institutional, wholesale , wealth management clients a more \\ncomprehensive offering and enhanced access to exclusive co -investment opportunities. It will also provide \\nGeneral Partners with a single point of access to the full distribution power of our firm.  \\nIn Asset Management, we are offsetting margin compression by increasing operational efficiency, which is one \\nof the key focus areas for the business.  \\nIn Switzerland, we continue to enjoy the trust of our clients, despite a very competitive and, at times, less -than-\\nconstructive environment.  \\nWith around 30 billion Swiss francs in net new deposits in the last 13 months and approximately 350 billion of \\nloans extended to clients, we continue to maintain our role as an important engine of credit.  \\nSince the acquisition we granted or renewed around 85 billion Swiss francs of loans.  \\nHigher interest rates, the cost of increased regulatory, capital and liquidity requirements, a changing \\nmacroeconomic outlook, and, last but not least, the necessity to reprice some loans granted by Credit Suisse at \\nunacceptable risk -returns are having an impact on pricing of new credit.  \\nOf course, those are not always easy discussions to have with clients, but we are constructively engaging with \\nthem, and I believe the vast majority understand the rationale.  \\nSwitzerland is a key pillar of our strategy and we are fully committed to maintaining our leadership. Swiss clients \\nand the economy benefit from UBS’s unparalleled, competitive global reach and capabilities.  In turn, our \\nSwissness is a unique differentiat or when serving clients around the world.  \\nAs a testament of this symbiosis, we were recognized by Euromoney as Switzerland’s Best Bank for the tenth \\ntime since 2012 and the world’s best bank.  \\nAs we continue our integration journey in the Swiss business, we believe it will be important to further \\ncommunicate with all our stakeholders about our approach and strategy.  To that end, in September, our head \\nof Switzerland, Sabine Keller -Busse, will p resent at our flagship Best of Switzerland conference, which brings \\ntogether investors and corporate clients.  \\nLooking ahead and more broadly, ongoing geopolitical tensions and anticipation ahead of U.S. elections will \\nlikely result in heightened market volatility compared to the first half of the year.   \\nIn this environment we have two key priorities: First, we must continue to help clients manage the challenges \\nand opportunities that arise.  \\nSecond, we must stay focused and not allow short -term market dynamics to distract us from achieving our \\nultimate goal, which is to continue to execute on the integration and invest strategically to position UBS for \\nlong-term value creation.  \\nThe management appointments we announced in the second quarter will enable us to continue to progress on \\nthis journey. At the same time, we can put even more emphasis on our priorities and prospects for sustainable \\ngrowth, particularly in the Americas and Asia -Pacific.   \\n \\n Page 4 of 22 \\n We are confident this will also help us to deliver better outcomes for our clients and the communities where \\nwe live and work.  \\nWith that, I hand over to Todd.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\n \\nSlide 5 – Sustained revenue momentum with steady progress on cost reduction  \\nThank you Sergio, and good morning everyone.  \\nIn the second quarter, we delivered strong underlying profitability, and we made further progress in reducing \\ncosts and optimizing our balance sheet.  \\nNet profit in the quarter was 1.1 billion.  Our EPS was 34 cents and our underlying return on CET1 capital was \\n8.4%.  \\nThroughout my remarks today, I refer to underlying performance in US dollars and make comparisons to our \\nperformance in the first quarter, unless stated otherwise.  From the third quarter onwards, we’ll revert to making \\nyear-on-year comparisons as, by then , the prior year period will fully capture combined performance post the \\nCredit Suisse acquisition.   \\nSlide 6 – 1.1bn net profit with strong underlying profitability  \\nTurning to slide 6.  Total revenues for the quarter reached 11.1 billion with top -line performance in our core \\nbusinesses holding up nicely from a strong first quarter, down 2% sequentially.  \\nNet interest income headwinds were partially offset by higher recurring fee income in our wealth and Swiss \\nbusinesses, and by improving activity in IB capital markets.   \\nRevenues in our Non -core and Legacy business were positive in the quarter, albeit 0.6 billion lower versus an \\nexceptional first quarter.   \\nOn a reported basis, revenues reached 11.9 billion and included 0.8 billion of mainly purchase price allocation \\nadjustments in our core businesses, with an additional 0.6 billion expected in the third quarter.  \\nUnderlying operating expenses in the quarter were 9 billion, decreasing by 3%.  Excluding litigation and variable \\nand Financial Advisor compensation tied to production, expenses were also down 3% as we further progressed \\nour cost -cutting and workforce -mana gement initiatives despite the intense integration agenda.   \\nAt the end of the second quarter, there were about 35 hundred fewer total staff compared to the end of the \\nfirst quarter, and 23 thousand, or 15%, fewer since the end of 2022.  \\nIntegration -related expenses in the quarter were 1.4 billion, resulting in reported operating expenses of \\n10.3 billion.  \\nCredit loss expense was 95 million, driven by a small number of positions in our Swiss corporate loan book.  \\n \\n Page 5 of 22 \\n Our tax expense in the quarter was 293 million, representing an effective rate of 20%, helped by NCL’s \\nperformance and the initial positive effects of completed legal entity mergers.  \\nIn the second half of 2024, excluding the effects of any DTA re -valuation, we expect the effective tax rate to \\nbe around 35%, mainly as expected pre -tax losses in legacy Credit Suisse entities can’t be fully offset against \\nprofits elsewhere in the Group.  The tax rate could benefit if NCL continues to perform better -than-expected.  \\nWe continue to expect the ongoing optimization of our legal entity structure to gradually support a return to a \\nnormalized tax rate of around 23% by 2026.   \\nSlide 7 – Ongoing progress on gross and net cost saves  \\nTurning to our quarterly cost update on slide 7.  \\nExiting the second quarter, we achieved an additional 900 million in gross cost saves when compared to three \\nmonths earlier, bringing the cumulative total since the end of 2022 to 6 billion, or around 45% of our total \\ngross cost save ambition.   \\nWe estimate that around half of this quarter’s saves benefit our underlying opex with the other half reinvested \\nas planned in our technology estate as well as to offset increases in variable and Financial Advisor compensation \\ntied to production.  \\nTo date we’ve generated around 4 billion of net saves, primarily driven by NCL, which has shed around 3 and \\na half billion of its 2022 cost baseline.  \\nFollowing the legal entity mergers, we now turn our focus to the critical client account and platform migration \\nwork planned for our core businesses. We start in the fourth quarter with GWM’s booking hubs in Hong Kong, \\nSingapore, and Luxembourg, followed t hereafter by client account transitions in our Swiss booking center, \\nwhich supports both GWM and P&C.  \\nAlong with our ongoing cost run -down efforts in Non -core and Legacy, these initiatives represent the most \\nmaterial drivers of future cost savings as we decommission technology systems, hardware and data centers, \\nwhile also unlocking further staff capacity.    \\nAs I highlighted last quarter, the pace of saves is expected to moderately decelerate from the quarterly run rates \\nobserved over the last several quarters while we prepare for, and initially undertake, these significant integration \\nactivities.  We expect t o pick -up the pace as we implement these transitions throughout 2025 and into 2026, \\nparticularly benefiting the cost/income ratios of GWM and P&C.   \\nThe rate at which we are incurring integration -related expenses, which front -run underlying opex saves, is also \\nindicative of the headway we’re making on costs.  In the second half, we expect to book 2.3 billion of \\nintegration -related expenses, of which 1. 1 billion in the third quarter.  By the end of this year, we expect to \\nhave incurred around 70% of total costs to achieve our 2026 exit rate efficiency targets.   \\nSlide 8 – Maintaining a balance sheet for all seasons  \\nMoving to our balance sheet.  In the second quarter we reduced risk -weighted assets by a further 15 billion, of \\nwhich 8 billion from the active run -down of positions in our Non -core and Legacy portfolio, which I will come \\nback to shortly.  \\n \\n Page 6 of 22 \\n Over 8 billion of the decline was seen across the core business divisions, mainly resulting from the financial \\nresource optimization work in GWM and P&C.  As I highlighted earlier in the year, this work is addressing sub -\\nhurdle returns on capital deployed,  including by reducing deposit and loan volumes.  The upshot is additional \\ncapacity to absorb headwinds from regulatory and risk methodology changes, model harmonization between \\nthe two banks, and the implementation of Basel 3 Final, now confirmed for Janu ary 2025.   \\nWhile we continue active dialogue with our supervisor on various aspects of the final rules, at present we \\ncontinue to expect the Day 1 impact of Basel 3 Final to be around 5% of RWA, driven mainly by FRTB.  We’ll \\nupdate our estimates by no later than the fourth quarter as requirements firm.  \\nOur leverage ratio denominator decreased by 35 billion in the quarter. This reduction was driven by several \\nfactors, including full repayment of the central bank ELA facility granted to Credit Suisse, lower lending volumes, \\nmainly from our financial resour ce optimization efforts, and the active run -down of our NCL portfolio.  \\nWe ended the second quarter with an LCR of 212%, reflecting the ELA repayment, and TLAC of 198 billion.   \\nSlide 9 – Strong capital position at group and parent bank level  \\nTurning to slide 9. Our CET1 capital ratio as of quarter -end was 14.9%.  \\nThe numerator reflects accruals of this year’s expected dividend and a reserve for 2024 share repurchases, of \\nwhich we have executed 467 million of the planned 1 billion, as of last Friday.  Additionally, our CET1 capital \\nincludes all relevant portions of the purchase price allocation adjustments made to Credit Suisse’s equity as of \\nthe acquisition date last June.   \\nWith the 12 -month measurement period now concluded, total PPA adjustments against the purchased equity \\nof Credit Suisse amounted to negative 26.5 billion, of which about 70% reduced CET1 capital.  \\nFollowing completion of the parent bank merger earlier in the quarter, next week we’ll report UBS AG’s \\nconsolidated and standalone capital ratios and other information for the first time on a combined basis.   \\nUBS AG’s standalone CET1 capital ratio at quarter -end is expected at 13.5% on a fully applied basis.   \\nTo put this capital ratio in perspective, it’s important to compare the way we manage our parent bank capital \\nversus Credit Suisse’s pre -acquisition practices.  We provide for the complete transition of the risk -weight rule \\nchanges applicable to UBS AG’s s ubsidiary investments, which overall are valued prudently.  Moreover, we don’t \\ndepend on any affiliate valuation concession from the regulator.  This was not the case with Credit Suisse before \\nthe take -over, where its approach overstated the parent bank’s resilience, and ultimately limited restructuring \\noptionality.  \\nIn this context, our merged parent bank already provides for around 20 billion of additional capital resulting \\nfrom the acquisition, including the progressive add -ons from growth in balance sheet and market share that \\nwill be phased -in over five years star ting in 2026.  The result is a parent bank capital buffer of around 100 basis \\npoints above the current fully -applied requirement by 2030.   \\nSlide 10 – Global Wealth Management  \\nMoving to our business divisions, and starting with Global Wealth Management on slide 10.   \\n \\n Page 7 of 22 \\n GWM’s pre -tax profit was 1.2 billion on revenues of 5.8 billion, which were up 3% year -over-year on an \\nestimated, combined basis.  \\nAgainst a complex economic backdrop, clients sought our differentiated advice and solutions as evidenced by \\ncontinued strong momentum in net new asset inflows and transactional activity.  \\nOverall, we generated 27 billion of net new assets, a growth rate of 2.7%, with positive inflows across all \\nregions.  I’m particularly pleased with this result considering the variety of headwinds to net new asset growth \\nthat the business successfully navi gated in the quarter, including around 6 billion in seasonal tax outflows in \\nthe US. Let me unpack this further.  \\nTo date, we’ve retained the vast majority of Credit Suisse’s invested assets notwithstanding that more than \\n40% of Credit Suisse’s wealth advisors have left since October 2022.  I would also note that these relationship \\nmanagers advised on only 20% of asse ts, meaning that, overall, we’ve retained the more productive Credit \\nSuisse advisors, a testament to the appeal of our platform.  \\nWe’ve also kept around 80% of the first large wave of maturing fixed term deposits from last year’s win -back \\ncampaign, with the peak in maturities expected in the third quarter.   \\nFurthermore, we made strong progress this quarter in our efforts to increase profitability on sub -hurdle \\nrelationships.  Higher returns come from both driving increased platform revenue and proactively exiting sub -\\npar loans, with these actions in the quart er boosting the revenue over RWA margin by around 30 basis points \\nsequentially.   \\nLastly, from a macro standpoint, the equity capital markets, and in particular IPO activity, ordinarily a significant \\ndriver of wealth creation and net new asset generation, have only recently started to recover.  \\nThese dynamics underscore the basis of our short -term annual guidance of 100 billion for 2024 and 2025 and, \\nequally, the resilience of our net new asset achievement in the quarter as well as the high level of client \\nconviction in our advice and solutions.  \\nNow, onto details of GWM’s financial performance.  \\nRevenues declined 2% sequentially, as lower NII and the expected sequential drop in transactional activity, were \\npartially offset by growth in recurring net fee income, supported by higher average levels of fee generating \\nassets.  \\nNet interest income decreased by 2% sequentially to 1.6 billion, driven by ongoing deposit mix shifts and \\ndeclining loan volumes, partially offset by our repricing actions, which as mentioned support higher returns on \\ncapital and net interest margin.  \\nLooking towards year -end, we maintain our previous guidance that full year 2024 NII will be roughly flat versus \\n4Q23 annualized.  This includes a low -to-mid single digit percentage sequential drop in the third quarter, driven \\nby a decrease in volumes, mix shifts in anticipation of falling rates, and the impact on our replication portfolios.   \\nIn arriving at this outlook, and in light of recent rates volatility, we’re modeling 100 basis points of US dollar \\npolicy rate reductions by the end of 2024.   \\n \\n Page 8 of 22 \\n The outlook for net interest income in our US wealth business is expected to be influenced by competitive \\ndynamics affecting the pricing of sweep deposits.  By the middle of 4Q24, we intend to adjust the sweep \\ndeposit rates in our US advisory accounts, whi ch, net of offsetting factors, are expected to reduce pre -tax profits \\nby around 50 million annually.  \\nLooking across our wealth business beyond year -end, we expect an inflection point in GWM net interest income \\naround the time implied forwards reach a structural floor and stabilize, and clients begin to re -leverage, driving \\nloan balances and NII higher.  \\nMoreover, it’s essential to consider that GWM’s diversified and CIO -driven fee -generating business model has \\nproven both its appeal to clients and ability to drive profitable growth, even during past periods of low or \\nnegative interest rates.  Consequently , in addition to increased lending, it’s reasonable to expect that lower \\ninterest rates will spur increased transactional activity, mandate sales and investments in alternatives across our \\nwealth business.  \\nRecurring net fee income increased by 3% to 3.1 billion from higher client balances.  Net sales in our UBS \\nmanaged account offerings showed continued momentum, contributing to a sequentially higher recurring net \\nfee margin in the quarter.  \\nTransaction -based revenues decreased quarter -on-quarter to 1.1 billion, but notably increased around 14% \\nyear-on-year on an estimated, combined basis, with APAC up around 30% and the Americas up over 20%, \\nand broadly flat sequentially versus a strong first quarter.  Both regions performed exceptionally well in \\nstructured products as clients sought customized investment opportunities in an environment of low volatility, \\nhigh interest rates, and continue d global tech appeal.  \\nI would also highlight that our investments in combining GWM and IB markets and solutions capabilities in the \\nAmericas are paying off as evidenced by our transactional revenue performance over the first half of the year, \\nup around 20% versus the same perio d in 2023.  \\nExpenses were roughly flat quarter -on-quarter. Excluding compensation -related effects, underlying operating \\nexpenses dropped 2% sequentially.  As highlighted earlier, the upcoming client account migration work is \\nexpected to be a significant driver of cost  reductions in GWM throughout 2025 and into 2026.   \\nSlide 11 – Personal & Corporate Banking (CHF)  \\nTurning to Personal and Corporate Banking on slide 11.  P&C delivered a second quarter pre -tax profit of 645 \\nmillion Swiss francs.  \\nRevenues were down 4% sequentially, driven by an 8% decline in net interest income that was partly offset \\nwith increases in recurring net fees and transaction -based revenues.   \\nP&C’s NII in the quarter was primarily affected by higher liquidity costs and the SNB’s 25 basis point interest \\nrate cut from March, as we kept our Swiss clients’ deposit pricing unchanged.   \\nIn the third quarter, we expect NII to tick down sequentially by a low single digit percentage, mainly due to the \\neffects of the SNB’s second 25 basis -point rate cut from late June.  In US dollar terms, we expect NII to be \\nroughly flat sequentially.  \\n \\n Page 9 of 22 \\n Despite these effects, as well as higher costs related to the SNB’s move earlier in the quarter to raise minimum \\nreserve requirements, we nevertheless reaffirm our full -year 2024 guidance of a mid -to-high single digit \\npercentage decline versus 4Q23 annuali zed, supported by our balance sheet actions.  In arriving at this outlook, \\nwe are currently pricing -in up to two further Swiss franc policy rate reductions of 25 basis points each by the \\nend of 2024.  \\nAssuming Swiss franc interest rates stabilize next year, as the forward rate curve presently implies, we expect \\nshortly thereafter to see steadying volumes and an inflection point in P&C’s net interest income.  \\nWe also expect by then that our balance sheet optimization work will be largely complete, with loan pricing \\nreflecting a more appropriate cost of risk across the Swiss credit book.  These efforts are necessary to restore \\nreturns on capital deployed and net  interest margin in our Swiss business to pre -acquisition levels.  \\nIn this respect, we saw net new lending outflows of 3.4 billion Swiss francs this quarter, driven by repricing of \\nsub-hurdle volumes, despite having renewed or granted new loans to our Swiss clients of around 30 billion \\nSwiss francs in 2Q.  \\nTransaction -based revenues were up 2% mainly from higher credit card usage.  Recurring net fee income gained \\n3% on higher custody assets.  Together, these non -NII revenue lines, up 2%, demonstrate the business’s \\neffectiveness in staying close to clients an d minimizing merger dis -synergies.  \\nCredit loss expense was 92 million, driven by a small number of positions in our corporate loan book, as I \\nmentioned earlier.  Even with the increased focus on risk -based pricing for maturing loan positions, our Swiss \\ncredit portfolio remains of very high quality, with an impaired loan ratio of 1.1%, down sequentially, albeit up \\nversus pre -Credit Suisse acquisition levels.  \\nFor the foreseeable future, we expect CLE to remain at broadly similar levels given increased book -size post \\nmerger, the relative strength of the Swiss franc and some economic softness in the main Swiss export markets.  \\nOperating expenses were flat sequentially.  Similar to GWM, future cost reductions in P&C will be closely tied \\nto the client account and platform migration work for Booking Center Switzerland, planned to commence by \\nthe second quarter of 2025.   \\nSlide 12 – Asset Management  \\nOn slide 12, pre -tax profit in Asset Management increased 26% to 228 million.   \\nThis quarter’s result included a gain of 28 million from the initial portion of the sale of our Brazilian real estate \\nfund management business.  In the third quarter, we expect to record an additional 60 million in underlying \\npre-tax profit on gains from d isposals, mainly from closing the residual portions of this transaction.   \\nNet new money was negative 12 billion, with continued client demand for our SMA offering in the US and \\npositive contribution from our China JVs, only partly compensating outflows across asset classes, particularly \\nequities.   \\nWhile integration efforts to consolidate platforms may constrain AM’s net new money performance over the \\nnext few quarters, we expect our enhanced global reach and increased scale in alternatives and indexing to at \\nleast partially offset these headwinds.  \\n \\n Page 10 of 22 \\n Net management fees dropped 5% as outflows in select active products weighed on margins.  Performance \\nfees were roughly stable in the quarter.  \\nDuring 2Q, AM made strong progress in improving operational efficiency, a key focus area I highlighted during \\nthe investor update earlier this year.  Operating expenses were 9% lower sequentially on reductions across both \\nnon-personnel and personnel costs,  partially supported by lower variable compensation.  Some of the sequential \\ndecline in variable comp is expected to normalize in the third quarter.    \\nSlide 13 – Investment Bank  \\nOn to our Investment Bank’s performance on slide 13, which, as in prior quarters, I compare on a year -over-\\nyear basis.   \\nThe IB delivered a strong second  quarter result with improving capital markets activity supporting an excellent \\nBanking quarter.  Our Markets businesses performed well in an environment reflecting mixed market trends, in \\nparticular low volatility in equities, rates and FX, as well as lowe r cash equity volumes in APAC, where we’re \\noverweight.  \\nOperating profit was 412 million, up from an operating loss of 14 million a year earlier, and up 2% sequentially, \\nas the investment banking backdrop continues to improve.  Investments to deepen our US presence are having \\na positive impact on revenues, as a re contributions of Credit Suisse talent across key sectors of Banking and \\nMarkets.  \\nUnderlying revenues grew by 26% to 2.5 billion with nearly two thirds of the increase coming from the \\nAmericas.  I would highlight that our revenue growth was achieved with broadly similar levels of RWA, as the \\nIB continues to manage within the Group RWA l imit of 25%, excluding NCL.  \\nBanking revenues were up 55% as we outperformed global fee pools, both in capital markets and advisory.  \\nSince the end of 2023, we have gained over a percentage point in market share in each of our strategic banking \\ninitiatives, including M&A and sponsors in the Americas.  Regionally, APAC saw revenues nearly double, while \\nthe US was up 83%.  EMEA declined by 3% against a very strong prior period.  \\nCapital Markets revenues were up 82% year -over-year with an outstanding LCM performance reflecting an \\nincrease in refinancing activity, mainly in the US.  Advisory revenues increased by 23% as we leveraged our \\nstrong position in APAC to benefit from increased activity and performed well in the Americas.  \\nThe strength of our fully integrated coverage teams is visible in our ability to win new mandates, where we \\nrank 7th globally in announced M&A volumes, making for an encouraging deal pipeline.  While we expect to \\ncontinue capturing market share, macro and geopolitical factors are likely to weigh on continued sequential \\nBanking revenue growth in the near term.  \\nRevenues in Markets reached 1.8 billion, the best second quarter result in over a decade, up 18% year -on-year \\nand driven by the Americas, up nearly 40%.  \\nEquities revenues were up 17%, driven by both Derivatives and Cash, where we have seen material gains in \\nmarket share.   \\n \\n Page 11 of 22 \\n FRC was up 20% with broad increases across FX, credit and rates, benefitting from higher client activity, \\nparticularly in FX and rates options, partially offset by lower activity and spread compression that affected our \\nrates flow business.   \\nOperating expenses rose 12%, predominantly reflecting higher variable compensation linked to improved \\nperformance.   \\nSlide 14 – Non-core and Legacy  \\nMoving to Slide 14.  \\nNon-core and Legacy’s pre -tax loss in the quarter was 80 million, supported by around 400 million in revenues, \\nprincipally from gains on position exits across corporate credit and securitized products, and further reductions \\nin the NCL cost base.  \\nUnderlying opex was down 37% sequentially, helped by releases in litigation reserves of 172 million.  Excluding \\nlitigation, operating expenses declined by 17%, as we made strong progress driving down personnel costs and \\nthird party spend.  \\nNCL’s six -month pre -tax profit of 117 million, which far exceeds earlier loss expectations, demonstrates the \\nbusiness’s skillful management in de -risking its portfolios and rapidly cutting its costs.  \\nFor the second half of the year, we expect an underlying pre -tax loss of around 1 billion, reflecting moderate \\nshort -term upside to revenues, and continued sequential progress on cost reduction, albeit at a slower rate than \\nobserved over recent quarters.   \\nSlide 15 – Strong progress on cost and balance sheet reductions in Non -core and Legacy  \\nMoving to slide 15.  \\nOver the last four quarters, NCL has made impressive progress running down its costs across all lines, cutting \\nits underlying operating expense base by over 2 billion, or around 50%.   \\nNCL has also excelled in running down its balance sheet positions, significantly contributing to Group capital \\nefficiency, releasing 5 billion in capital as a result of its efforts.  Additionally, NCL has cut its non -operational \\nrisk-weighted assets by alm ost 60% over the last year, including by another 8 billion this quarter, mainly from \\nactively exiting positions across its portfolios, notably in investment grade and high -yield corporate credit, \\nsecuritized products, and macro.  \\nSimilarly, NCL’s LRD is down by over 60% since 2Q23, dropping another 40 billion of leverage exposure this \\nquarter, reflecting lower notionals as well as lower levels of HQLA.  In terms of book closures, NCL shuttered \\nanother 10% of its active books in the  quarter, bringing the total since last June to around 45%.  \\nLooking ahead, the progress we are making is visible in the natural roll -off profile, significantly narrowing the \\ngap to our active run -down expectation of around 5% of Group RWA by 2026.  \\nFurther supporting this and as additional evidence of NCL’s proficiency in de -risking its balance sheet and driving \\ndown costs, yesterday we agreed to sell Credit Suisse’s US mortgage servicing business.  This transaction is \\n \\n Page 12 of 22 \\n expected to close in 1Q25, and would reduce RWA by around 1.3 billion, LRD by around 1.7 billion, and \\nannualized costs by around 250 million.   \\nSlide 16 – We are positioning UBS for sustainable growth and long -term value creation  \\nTo summarize, the second quarter demonstrated the power, scale and secular growth potential of our franchise \\nas we delivered strong underlying profitability and continued to make substantial progress across our \\nintegration agenda while reinforcing a balanc e sheet for all seasons.  \\nWith that, let’s open for questions.   \\n \\n Page 13 of 22 \\n Analyst Q&A (CEO and CFO)  \\n \\nGiulia Miotto, Morgan Stanley  \\nHi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I'll ask two, please. So my first one, thank you very \\nmuch for the guidance on NII in GWM which was something the market was looking forward to. Can I just \\nask a clarification? If you look at the current forward curve, when do you expect NII to bottom exactly? Do \\nyou think second half 2024 and then we can grow , or possibly first half of 2025? So that's the first question.  \\nAnd then the second question is, instead, on the capital of the parent and in particular the CSI, it seems to \\nhave a lot of excess capital and upstreaming that could reduce the impact of – the potential impact from the \\nproposal in Switzerland. Can we expec t UBS to upstream some of that capital or how are you thinking about \\nexcess capital at subsidiaries? Thank you.  \\nTodd T uckner  \\nSo, regarding the NII guidance in terms of the implied forward curve. So as I mentioned, you know, we ended \\nup pricing in, as you saw, and modeled for a 25 basis point rate cuts through the end of the year. If you look \\nout in , in terms when the implied forward curve would suggest bottoming out, you know, we're probably \\npricing in more like 7 depending on what you're looking at.  \\nSo, you know, I mean, from here, while difficult to speculate, it could be sometime in mid -2025, but I spent \\ntime what I think is really important to recognize is that, you know, in a lower NII – lower interest rate \\nenvironment, there are significant offse ts and tailwinds in the business that we expect to see.  \\nAnd that was a point that we wanted to really ensure is well understood because ultimately transaction \\nrevenues , re-leveraging and driving up NII from re -leveraging , and also recurring fees from mandate sales, you \\nknow, all  have upside in an environment of lower interest rates. In terms of the parent bank capital, you \\nmentioned our UK – Credit Suisse's UK subsidiary that has excess capital, of course, we're working on \\nrestructuring and on all of our subsidiaries where we can.   \\nAnd ultimately, you know, we will as appropriate upstream the capital in any of the subsidiaries in order to \\nalleviate the capital at the parent bank.  \\nGiulia Miotto, Morgan Stanley  \\nThank you.  \\nAndrew Coombs, Citi  \\nGood morning. Let's just drill down to the areas where you've perhaps delivered ahead of expectations. So \\nfirstly, on the Non -core, another successful quarter of actively reducing the RWAs and some further gains on \\nsome of those division exits. You're now talking about narrowing that gap in the natural runoff. So based on \\nthe natural  runoff you’ll be at  6% and you're aiming for 5%.  \\nSo I think that is only another USD 5 billion inside of active RWA management in that business. And now you \\nalluded to the close of the US mortgage servicing business will get you some way towards that. So, should we \\nassume that active management within the NCL book is now largely complete o r will be largely complete by \\nthe end of this year?  \\n \\n Page 14 of 22 \\n And then my second question is just on costs. Previously, I think you  were  expecting to be at 50% by end \\n2024. You're now 55% guiding by end of 2024 of the total cost saving target of next so USD 500 million of \\ncost saves you realized earlier than expected. Which division is it that these cost are coming through earlier \\nthan expected? And in your mind, is it purely just a timing issue that coming through earlier as opposed to a \\nquantum issue that  you're delivering more cost savings than expected? Thank you.  \\nTodd T uckner  \\nYeah, thanks a lot, Andrew. On the second one in terms of on the costs and the performance and \\noutperformance we're continuing to see. I mean, that's really driven, as I highlighted in my comments by NCL \\nfor sure , NCL is driven the lion's share of the gross cost saves to date while the other divisions have \\ncontributed,  it has been really a function of their active rundown of positions, but also the restructuring of \\nvarious parts of Credit Suisse as a G -SIB that we've highlighted in the past is an important part of taking out \\nthe costs. And a lot of those costs reside, you know, in NCL. So, they've been really the benefactor of the cost \\nperformance. And as we look out towards the end of the year, the additional progress that we anticipate, \\neven though, as I suggest, we expect a bit a moderate deceleration in the gross cost saves, that's expected to \\nbe yielded also by NCL. And as I highlighted, you know, the core business divisions will then – the ratio of \\ncore to non -core or non -core to core in terms of cost takeout will invert as we g et into the second half of the \\nintegration agenda and we'll start to see the significant cost reductions hitting through in particular GWM \\nand P&C.  \\nAnd just on the first , in terms of how we see the natural runoff and the success we've had in the quarter, you \\nknow, of course, we're not counting on, you know, extrapolating and we take economic decisions as they \\narise and the opportunities arise. And so, you know, difficult to extrapolate the great outc ome that we've had \\nto date to suggest a different outcome than the natural roll -off. And that's why we continue to disclose it.  \\nSo, you know, that becomes clear. What is important and Sergio commented this in his remarks that, you \\nknow, the uncertainty delta continues to narrow. And that's what you know, I think it's important that, you \\nknow, ultimately, while we can't count on anything in particular  in terms of what can come off the balance \\nsheet of NCL, in terms of extrapolation, what we can say is that the uncertainty delta has narrowed very \\nsignificantly.  \\nAndrew Coombs, Citigroup  \\nThat's clear. Thank you. I guess the follow on would just be your previous guidance was for a typical run rate \\nof close to zero revenues from NCL per quarter and presuming that's unchanged?  \\nTodd T uckner  \\nYeah. As I said Andrew, that we see in the long -term, that's for sure the case in the short -term, i.e. the 2H \\nguidance that I offered, we see some modest upside to current book values on the revenue side. So, some \\nmodest uptake in driving the billion underlying PBT loss guidance that I offered in my comments.  \\nAndrew Coombs, Citigroup  \\nThank you.  \\nJeremy  Sigee, B NP Paribas  \\nHi there. Thank you. Two questions, please. First one, just follows on from just exactly what you were talking \\nabout there, the guidance for the P&L drag from NCL. Obviously, it's going better than expected, which is \\n \\n Page 15 of 22 \\n great to see. What would we expect now – previously you were talking about USD 2 billion P&L drag exit rate \\nin 2025 and then USD 1 billion exiting 2026. And obviously it's going much better than that with sort of a \\nUBS 1 billion drag in the second half that you're integrating. What should we expect for 2025? And could the \\nNCL drag be finished within 2025 rather than carrying on into 2026? Any update on that would be really \\nhelpful.  \\nAnd then my second question, just a more sort of specific one on investment banking costs. They drifted up a \\nlittle bit more than revenues in the second quarter, it's not a big move, but the cost income deteriorated \\nagainst those strong revenues rather tha n perhaps you might have hoped it could have improved a little bit. \\nSo, any comments on the drivers, whether there's any one -offs in there or anything unusual, just how we \\nshould interpret that IB cost number, please  \\nTodd T uckner  \\nSo, Jeremy, thanks. On the second one in the comp on IB costs, it's the comp quarter, of course, only has \\nCredit Suisse personnel in for a short period of time for just the one month when you look at the year -on-year \\ncomp, whereas the current quarters as y ou know the people we've added for the full quarters. So that's \\ndriving that that variance.  \\nJeremy  Sigee, B NP Paribas  \\nI'm sorry, speaking Q -on-Q, I think the costs are up 3% and the revenues are up 1%. So, I was thinking more \\nQ-on-Q. \\nTodd T uckner  \\nOn – yeah on Q -on-Q, it would be just some compensation -related effects that were  hitting through driving \\nthe Q -on-Q. But I'd have to - Go back and look at that. But really, it's more  year-on-year that we focused on.  \\nJeremy  Sigee, B NP Paribas  \\nWhich is variable.  Okay.  \\nTodd T uckner  \\nOn the – in terms of the guidance on the P&L drag and in NCL, in terms of what we should expect. Look, I \\nmean, we're really pleased with the performance we've had to date, as I said in my last comments, there's no \\nway to extrapolate from that performance i s straight line and to assume that that's the, you know, the pace \\nof which will continue.  \\nSo, you know, we – our guidance remains, that's where in terms of the P&L drag at the end of 2026 is right \\nnow, still our best estimate when we come back and talk about an outlook in the fourth quarter going \\nforward, you know, potentially we update that an d see where we are. But for now, that's our best estimate \\nin terms of where we land.  \\nJeremy  Sigee, B NP Paribas  \\nUnderstood. Thank you very much.  \\nKian Abou hossein , JP Morg an \\n \\n Page 16 of 22 \\n Yes, thanks for taking my questions. The first one is related to Wealth Management. First of all, thanks again \\nfor the disclosure. I hope some of  the US peers are listening as this was very helpful relative to what I heard \\nbefore from US peers. Sweep deposits last Disclosure was $35.7 billion. I was wondering where we are \\nroughly right now in the US entity? If you could also share – share with us the a dvisory part of that so we can \\nkind of understand the adjustment factor and what rate you are paying now versus what rate you will be \\npaying for the fee deposits on this advisory mandates?  And in that context, if you could briefly talk about \\nlending, which was down ex -US, just to understand how much of that is related to adjustments of your \\noffering to the CS client versus actually losses in lending?  \\nAnd then the second question is on legal entity on page 19, a very useful chart. And you talk about further \\nlegal entity simplification in the US as well as the UK legal entity going into a branch, I was wondering what \\ncapital relief you expect from that o r maybe even in subjective terms, if you can talk a little bit about the \\nchanges that will happen in when you describe it here on the page.  \\nTodd T uckner  \\nThanks, Kian for the question. So on, in terms of the second one, first, the simplification that we talk about is \\ncontinuing in the UK and in the US, but also in other parts of the world , to continue merging subsidiaries out \\nof existence to create and unlock more capital , funding and tax efficiencies, so that's what we're getting to. \\nSo we're working all through that, you know, we just, of course, the big parent bank and Swiss  bank \\nmergers, we reparented  the IHC, but now there's still a lot of work that will continue to unlock these \\nbenefits.  \\nSo in terms of capital relief, naturally, to the extent that , and this goes a little bit to the question that was \\nasked earlier in terms of the repatriation of excess capital, say  in a subsidiary, of course, that is part of the \\nanalysis that we go through as we work through it. But it's, you know, there are contingencies to the timeline \\nin terms of what triggers and what the timing could be to merge some of these entities out of ex istence.  \\nIn terms of GWM, so, you know what I can say on the sweep deposits, first of all, advisory is about a third of \\nthe total, the total that we have in sweeps. So, just to give – to dimension that a bit, this is I think that's \\nprobably useful to understand. An d then as far as the pricing it goes, of course, the way we're, first of all, it's \\na function of interest rates because I mentioned we're going to introduce the new rates in advisory in the \\nfourth quarter because we have to change systems and go through so me transitional work to get there.  \\nSo, we have to see also where interest rates are. So in terms of an absolute price that I can’t offer, but what I \\ncan say is that we will for sure price in the value of the insurance coverage we offer on deposits that benefit \\nfrom multiple programs, multiple bank programs and reciprocal programs that we've invested in and that will \\nfeature into the price of the rate we ultimately offer.  \\nIn terms lending balances ex -US the main driver of that, I mean, you know, clearly we've seen deleveraging in \\na higher interest rate market for outside the US, particular in APAC for several quarters running. You know, \\nwe're looking forward and seeing some signs of tapering there, but we continue to see that. As I highlighted, \\nyou know, as rates come down, we do expect that should taper and then start – we start to see clients re -\\nleverage. But so , the rate environment is driving some of that but the other part of it, perhaps the more  \\nsignificant driver is the financial resource optimization work we're doing that, you know, a consequence of \\nthat is that loans will roll off our platform, which is one of the points I highlighted in connection with the net \\nnew asset report.  \\nKian Abou hossein , JP Morg an \\n \\n Page 17 of 22 \\n And it's not just on sweep. I know that Morgan Stanley has confirmed 2% rate to be paid. Should we look at \\nsimilar rates and could you just also remind us of where we are on the sweep volumes at the moment? Last \\nnumber  we saw was $35.7 billion?  \\nTodd T uckner  \\nYeah. What I can say Kian is that the number is across to come in a little bit and it's driven – is in also some of \\nthe comments I made on mix is driving the 2Q result. So you could assume that number has come a little bit \\nlower and all I could say, you know, get anything further o n the rate is, you know, as mentioned competitive \\ndynamics you know will ultimately feature and how we what – we ultimately settle on a price – on price for \\nthe sweep deposit s.  \\nSo, you know, as I said, I gave some views on considerations that we – that we will factor in. But as far as an \\nabsolute price, you know, that's not at this point something that we have settled on.  \\nKian Abou hossein , JP Morg an \\nThanks.  \\nAnke Reingen, RBC  \\nYeah, thank you very much for taking my question – questions. The first one is just on the Basel IV impact of \\nthe USD 25 billion on the 1st of January 2025. I guess you said you will give us a bit more detail with \\npotentially before year -end. But I mean, you previously talked about a USD 15 billion net of, yeah, Non -core \\nrundown. Do you have a – can you give us a better indication of how the USD 25 billion will actually look on \\nthe 1st of January 2025?  \\nAnd then, sorry, coming back on the NII guidance, just confirming the P&C reiterating of guidance that's on \\nthe US dollar basis rather than Swiss francs. And just conceptually, I mean I see, I mean, you now assume \\nmore rate cuts than before, but the guidance is reiterated. Can you just maybe highlight what the missing \\npieces that allows you to reiterate guidance? Thank you very much.  \\nTodd T uckner  \\nYeah, thanks, Anke. So on Basel III final, you know, as mentioned, we still expect a USD 25 billion impact is \\n5% of risk -weighted assets. So in that range, as you mentioned, we guided in the fourth quarter in our \\ninvestor update that USD 15 billion is in the core, USD 10 billion ’s in non-core I think for now, that split \\nremains pretty robust in terms of how  we're thinking, how we're seeing it , and naturally will continue to \\nwork down the NCL portfolio to make that impact lessened over time.  \\nIn terms of the NII guidance for P&C, just, you asked for clarity on – it is in Swiss francs so we're guiding in \\nSwiss francs, we'll offer both in the future to sort of help, as I mentioned  in 3Q, we see low – a low -single -\\ndigit down in Swissy, but flat sequentially in USD. And as I mentioned, you know, I think that's a good \\noutcome that we've had a number of headwinds that we've been working through, so to  reaffirm the \\nguidance for the full year is also a function of some management actions that have been taken, including \\nsome loan repricing actions that have helped.  \\nSo those are the drivers of the NII guidance for P&C.  \\nAnke Reingen, RBC  \\n \\n Page 18 of 22 \\n Sorry, just to follow up. So on the 1st of January 25, as the 25 – I mean, the 5% increase in RWA or should it \\nbe lower because some mitigation  or NCL run down has already kicked -in or reduced the impact?  \\nTodd T uckner  \\nNo, no, the estimate is on the same basis we gave it in 4Q terms of the impact because it's mainly FRTB \\ndriven. So for now assume the guidance remains and as I said, if we have an update before we go live with it \\n- of course we'll come back and provide it.  \\nAnke Reingen, RBC  \\nOkay. Thank you very much.  \\nChis Hallam, Goldman Sachs  \\nYeah, good morning and thanks for taking my questions. So first, you've guided  for banking to generate \\nalmost twice the baseline revenues by 2026 assuming supportive markets. So, obviously performance was \\nvery strong in the second quarter. But then we saw this period of elevated volatility at the start of August . Has \\nthat changed anything in terms of how close we are now to supportive markets? And how would you expect \\nthe recovery to progress through the second half of this year?  \\nAnd then second question, just on profitability, at the start of the year, you said you'd expect to get to \\naround 45% of the USD 13 billion gross savings by the end of 2024, and you've got that by the end of the \\nfirst half. And you also guided for mid -single -digit underlying return on core tier  one this year and mid to high \\nfor next year. Consensus is at 6% for this year and 9% for next year. But in the first half you're already above \\n9%. So how should we be thinking now about the path for underlying return on core tier one through 2024 \\nand 2025?  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nThank you, Chris. I'll take the first question. So, look, you know, I think, of course, the market environment, \\nit's quite volatile and there are element of fragility that we see. But, you know, what is most important for us \\nis to look through the short -term market dynamics. And, you know, I can tell you that I'm very confident that \\nwe are building up a very compelling pipeline in terms of mandate that we win still not announce d and things \\nthat can be then executed in a normalized market environment.  \\nSo, of course, if we see the kind of the volatility we had in a couple of weeks ago, that would not be very \\nhelpful for the pipeline. But in general, I'd stay, you know, I would say that - positive in respect of our \\nmomentum. So, a good pipeline and good momentum in winning mandates. But, of course, it will also \\ndepend on market conditions.  \\nTodd T uckner  \\nAnd Chris, on the second, in terms of a return on core tier 1 and how it relates to our guidance. So, you \\nknow, as you mentioned, we initially guided it mid - for mid -single -digits for 2024 and mid -to-high for 2025. \\nSo naturally, if there's an update, we'll bring it to you and we talk about our 2025 expectations later this year. \\nIn terms of where we are, you know, as Sergio highlighted in his comments are the fi rst six months we \\ngenerated an underlying return on CET1 of 9.2%. So, obviously we're comfortably ahead of the target of mid \\nfor 2024.  \\nAmit Goel, Med ioban ca \\n \\n Page 19 of 22 \\n Hi. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. So one, just to follow up, just to make sure I also had some of \\nthe previous guidance correctly. And I think you mentioned the cost of the repric e on sweep  to be about \\nUSD 50 million annually. And so, I mean, I guess, given the one third advisory disclosure, that would imply \\nonly, you know, just over 40 bps of incremental cost on that portion and effectively nothing on the rest. So, I \\nmean I was just kind of curious, I mean, in a way that you could continue to see outflows, so I'm wondering \\nwhat the capacity is for the group to replace that fundin g at similar cost?  \\nAnd then also just linked to that, if I look then at the total sweep and the cost of the sweep, it seems like that \\nthe earnings are pretty similar to what Wealth Management Americas generates. So I'm just kind of curious \\nhow you think about Wealth Manageme nt Americas profitability and with some of these headwinds, how \\nyou think you'll get back to that mid -teens operating margin?  \\nAnd then secondly, just curious on the parent, you know, is there any scope to shift exposure from foreign \\nparticipations to domestic in addition to capital repatriation? And, you know, whether that can be reflected in \\nparticipation values and, you know, i f there is potentially will change coming. Thank you.  \\nTodd T uckner  \\nThanks, Amit. Yeah, in terms of the second one, shifting exposure domestically, you know, whether that \\nhelps, it's way too early to speculate on how we're going to address and what actions we take. We don't \\nknow what the standards are. So, and where they'l l move to mean – where the standards will move, \\nassuming they move. And so to speculate about what mitigating actions might be available to us is  way too \\nearly.  \\nTerms of sweeps, yeah, I disclosed that the impact on pre -tax profit is expected be around USD 50 million \\nannualized in the US Wealth Business. You know, I did say that that's net of offsetting factors. So, that \\nincludes an array of banking initiatives and expense programs across various categories. So, there, I wouldn't \\ntake the USD 50 million as gross income, but actually, as I said, it is a net impact. And I think, look, you know, \\nI saw interesting that you asked the question and then, you know, lead to how we're going to address, you \\nknow, the pre -tax margin issues. You know, we – nothing has changed on that.  \\nWe're, you know, we're focused on that, we know we have to do. The sweep deposit issue, you know, is a \\nmodest hit on that, of course, because it's something we're saying is adverse to PBT. We think it's \\nmanageable and now we're getting on with the work of improving the mar gins on the basis of how we \\ndescribed that in the past. So, we know we have to do there and we're taking steps to achieve that.  \\nBenjamin Goy, Deutsche Bank  \\nHi, good morning. Two questions, please. So the first one on GWM in particular, America, the cost /income \\nratio remains above 90% and it was better during low interest rate times. So just wondering with the mix \\nshift from NII, and NII falling  [indiscernible] most likely, you  see upside to year -end 2026 cost /income ratio \\nimprovement in target.  \\nAnd then secondly on the capital side, you obviously have the group guiding for 14% CET1, but you see the \\n12.5% more the binding constraint and that's the first half of the question.  The second, with Switzerland \\nbeing the only geography introducing FRTB and not delaying it, do you think that's the final piece of the \\npuzzle in terms of higher capital requirements for you? Thank you.  \\nSergio P . Ermotti  \\nLet me take the second part of the question. Of course, you know, with the 14% guidance we have right \\nnow it stays as it is , and the 12.5% you mentioned it look -through fully applied 2030 at current requirements, \\n \\n Page 20 of 22 \\n we will see exactly how things develop in the next few quarters in terms of future requirements. From FRTB \\nstandpoint of view, of course, as you mentioned, Switzerland will introduce that on January 1. It will be a \\nshort -term competitive disadvantage, we d on't believe it's – we believe it's manageable short -term.  \\nOf course, this, should other jurisdictions not converge, not to converge to Basel III full implementation over \\nthe next couple of years then, of course,  that would be – it will be more problematic and we would need to \\nthink about how to address this matter. So, we remain confident that we will be able to have a level playing \\nfield in how we operate and compete globally. But it remains to be seen.  \\nTodd T uckner \\nAnd Benjamin, here's how we think about the – your cost /income ratio question for GWM. You know, we're \\n– we have a look through cost to income ratio presently of around 80%. You know, naturally when we plan \\nthe USD 13 billion of gross cost saves and the less than 70% cost income ratio, GWM factors in quite \\nprominently in that piece of work.  \\nAnd that's why, you know, I've highlighted that the cost income ratio will be benefited by the work that just \\ngoing to get going in the next quarter or two, which is the client account migration work and platform \\nconsolidation starting in APAC and parts of  Europe before the Swiss booking center.  \\nThat will drive significant cost down and ultimately, you know, which is why I believe that Wealth and P&C \\nwill benefit significantly in the latter half of the integration work. So in terms of where we get our cost \\nincome ratio, it will – GWM's cost to inc ome ratio in the end will be a big contributor to the group meeting \\nits target of less than 70% by the end of 2026.  \\nBenjamin Goy, Deutsche Bank  \\nThanks for that. This was  in particular on the Americas for GWM Americas, but you probably won't see much \\nof a cost save benefit, but correct me if I'm wrong.  Yeah, indeed from the 90 – from the 90% right now, \\nmore towards the 85% , accelerate with the different revenue mix?  \\nTodd T uckner \\nQuestion was on the  Americas, sorry I didn ’t hear it . Look, as I said also to the before and I've said previously, \\nwe're working towards the mid -teens profit margin over the next couple of years. That's where, you know, \\nwe know we have to narrow the gap where we are, that's where we are working towards. And t hat also \\nfeatures into the, you know, the less than 70% cost /income ratio by the end of 2026, getting to that level. \\nSo, you know, nothing that I've guided to today has changed any of that. We're very focused on taking the \\nsteps to achieve that by that in that timeframe.  \\nBenjamin Goy, Deutsche Bank  \\nThank you.  \\nTom Hallet, KBW  \\nHi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just – what do you assume in terms of loan and deposit growth in the \\nSwiss business NII guide and your GWM growth in the second half of the year? And then secondly, how do \\nyou see deposit mix shift and deposit betas evol ving within that guide as well? Thank you.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\n \\n Page 21 of 22 \\n Yeah, thanks, Tom. So in terms of – in terms of volumes in each of the businesses, you know, I expect loans \\nin both of the businesses through the end of 2024 to come slightly in, largely because of the balance sheet \\nwork that I highlighted in my comments. So, I think in both cases, loans would come in. I see deposits as well \\nthrough on the GWM side as well towards the end of the year.  \\nI mean, roughly flat at this point, I see P&C growing deposits whether, you know, through the rest of this \\nyear but certainly as we look out over the longer term. So, I would say a little bit of downward pressure in \\nterms of loans in large part just given the balance sheet work that we're doing.  \\nOn a deposit side, I see more of sort of flat to growing in the near to mid -term in terms of the balance sheet. \\nAnd in terms of, deposit mix shifts look, I think in the end we're, you know, we've been seeing as many \\nbanks have the effects of deposit mix an d cash sorting and rotation for some period of time, you know, as \\nrates start to come down, we expect that the cash sorting will continue to taper and it'll be less of an impact \\nin terms of the NII.  \\nAnd, you know, that's a little bit of what we're seeing in our outlook is just given the fact that we expect and \\nare modeling rates coming in, that we are seeing sort of in a way, the last vestige of mix shifts, though, as \\nwhile rates remain a bit higher. So that's how we see the deposit mix shift evolving.  \\nTom Hallet, KBW  \\nThank you.  \\nSergio P . Ermotti  \\nOkay, there are no more questions. Thank you all for calling in and your questions. And see you in end of \\nOctober for the Q3 results. Thank you.  \\n  \\n \\n Page 22 of 22 \\n Cautionary statement regarding forward -looking statements | This document  contains statements that constitute “forward -looking statements,” \\nincluding but not limited to management’s outlook for UBS’s financial performance, statements relating to the anticipated eff ect of transactions and \\nstrategic initiatives on UBS’s business a nd future development and goals or intentions to achieve climate, sustainability and other social objectives. While \\nthese forward -looking statements represent UBS’s judgments, expectations and objectives concerning the matters described, a number of risks , uncertainties \\nand other important factors could cause actual developments and results to differ materially from UBS’s expectations. In part icular, terrorist activity and \\nconflicts in the Middle East, as well as the continuing Russia –Ukraine war, may have significant impacts on global markets, exacerbate global inflationary \\npressures, and slow global growth. In addition, the ongoing conflicts may continue to cause significant population displaceme nt, and lead to shortages of \\nvital commodities, including ene rgy shortages and food insecurity outside the areas immediately involved in armed conflict. Governmental responses to the \\narmed conflicts, including, with respect to the Russia –Ukraine war, coordinated successive sets of sanctions on Russia and Belarus, an d Russian and \\nBelarusian entities and nationals, and the uncertainty as to whether the ongoing conflicts will widen and intensify, may cont inue to have significant adverse \\neffects on the market and macroeconomic conditions, including in ways that cannot be  anticipated. UBS’s acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group has \\nmaterially changed its outlook and strategic direction and introduced new operational challenges. The integration of the Cred it Suisse entities into the UBS \\nstructure is expected to take betwee n three and five years and presents significant risks, including the risks that UBS Group AG may be unable to achieve \\nthe cost reductions and other benefits contemplated by the transaction. This creates significantly greater uncertainty about forward -looking statements. \\nOther factors that may affect UBS’s performance and ability to achieve its plans, outlook and other objectives also include, but are not limited to: (i) the \\ndegree to which UBS is successful in the execution of its strategic plans, including  its cost reduction and efficiency initiatives and its ability to manage its \\nlevels of risk -weighted assets (RWA) and leverage ratio denominator (LRD), liquidity coverage ratio and other financial resources, including  changes in RWA \\nassets and liabilities arising from higher market volatility and the size of the combined Group;

Ermotti , Group  Chief  Executive  Officer , and Todd Tuckner , \\nGroup  Chief  Financial  Officer  \\n \\nIncluding analyst Q&A session  \\n \\nTranscript.  \\nNumbers for slides refer  to the first quarter 2025 results presentation . Materials and a webcast \\nreplay are available at www.ubs.com/investors   \\n \\n \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\n \\nSlide 3 – Key messages  \\nThank you, Sarah and good morning, everyone.  \\nOur strong results in the first quarter demonstrate once again our ability to deliver for stakeholders in different \\nmarket conditions.  \\nThe quarter was characterized by a substantial shift in investor sentiment and growth expectations, alongside \\nperiods of significant market volatility. This dampened the positive seasonal effect we typically experience at \\nthe start of the year, and tempere d the bullish outlook the market had coming out of 2024, and into the first \\nfew weeks of January.  \\nAgainst this backdrop, these results reflect the power and scale of our diversified global franchise, our \\nunwavering commitment to clients, disciplined cost management and the substantial progress made in \\nintegrating Credit Suisse. All this is underpinned by a balance sheet for all seasons.  \\nFirst-quarter net profit reached 1.7 billion, and our underlying return on CET1 capital stood at 11.3%, supported \\nby positive operating leverage in our core businesses.  \\nNet new inflows onto our asset -gathering platform were robust, including 32 billion in net new assets in Global \\nWealth Management  and 7 billion net new money in Asset Management . Although we haven’t seen a major \\nstrategic shift in asset allocation, the breadth and depth of our advice and global capabilities helped clients \\nprotect their wealth and navigate the market volatility.  \\nWe saw significant demand for mandate solutions, structured products and Alternatives, including new \\nofferings within our Unified Global Alternatives unit, where total assets reached nearly 300 billion.  For our \\nclients in Switzerland, we ke pt delivering on our commitment to be a reliable partner. During the quarter, we \\ngranted or renewed 40 billion Swiss francs of loans.   \\n \\n \\n Page 2 of 21 \\n \\n In the Investment Bank, we continue to execute on our capital -light strategy.  The investments we made in our \\nareas of strategic importance allowed us to win further market share. Global Markets achieved its best quarter \\non record. In Global Banking, we outperformed the fee pools in M&A and ECM, despite a challenging market \\nbackdrop.  I am also pleased to see that we  are building on our already -healthy pipeline.  \\nAs the second quarter kicked off, the unveiling of significant changes to tariffs on trading partners by the U.S. \\nadministration increased uncertainty and market volatility, while in some days, trading volumes exceeded their \\nCovid -era peak by around 30%.  \\nI am especially pleased by the way our colleagues were able to intensify their engagement with institutional \\nand private clients during this period.  The investments we’ve made to reinforce our infrastructure are paying \\noff, with our operations proving stable and resilient as we facilitate client activity across asset classes.  \\nLooking ahead, the economic path forward is particularly unpredictable, and the range of possible outcomes is \\nwide. The prospect of higher tariffs on global trade presents a material risk to global growth and inflation. \\nWhile we  are encouraged that negotiations are ongoing, a prolonged period of discussions and speculation will \\ncome at a cost. Uncertainty is likely to affect sentiment and lead businesses and investors to delay important \\ndecisions on strategy, capital allocation and  investment.  \\nIn this environment, we expect financial markets to remain sensitive to new developments, both positive and \\nnegative, which are likely to lead to further spikes in volatility. In light of this, we are unwavering in serving our \\nclients, executing on our gro wth strategy and following through on our integration plans.  \\nOn that, over the course of the first quarter, we finalized our preparations to migrate more than one million \\nclients in Switzerland onto UBS platforms and continued to integrate 95 petabytes of data.  We moved a small \\npilot group of clients at the start of April and we are on track to complete the first main wave of migrations by \\nthe end of the second quarter.  \\nWe are pleased with our progress in Non -core and Legacy as we continue to reduce the complexity of our \\noperations through book closures and the decommissioning of applications.  Moreover, our active wind -down \\nefforts have proven so effective that we have been able to upgrade our credit and market risk -weighted asset \\nambitions for 2025 and 2026.  \\nOur CET1 capital ratio stands in line with our guidance at 14.3%. This, combined with the substantial de -risking \\nof the acquisition and our highly capital -generative strategy, gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our \\n2025 capital return objecti ves. These remain contingent on maintaining a CET1 capital ratio of around 14% \\nand the absence of material, immediate changes to the current capital regime. Our capital strength also \\nsupports our ability to deploy investments that reinforce our leadership across the globe and position UBS for \\nthe future.  \\nWe are working to further enhance our client offering and capabilities to improve profitability in the Americas. \\nAt the same time, we are building on our status as the number -one wealth manager in APAC by scaling our \\noffering in the fastest growing markets  across the region, while reinforcing our leadership position in EMEA \\nand Switzerland.  \\n \\n \\n Page 3 of 21 \\n \\n As highlighted in February, technology investments are a key enabler for growth. We are encouraged by our \\ndevelopment and adoption of generative A.I. solutions as we empower our colleagues with tools to improve \\nproductivity and deliver tailored solutions t o clients.  \\nIn closing, we are pleased with our strong performance this quarter and continue to operate from a position of \\nstrength. But we are not complacent, as we are only around two -thirds of the way to restoring UBS’s pre -\\nacquisition levels of profitability.  In that sense, the next phase of the integration is especially important to \\nharvesting the full benefits of the acquisition for our clients and shareholders , and delivering on our long -term \\nambitions.  In the meantime, we  are staying focused on what we can control: serving our clients, delivering on \\nour financial targets and continuing to act as an engine of economic growth in the communities we serve.  \\nWith that, I hand over to Todd.    \\n \\n \\n Page 4 of 21 \\n \\n Todd Tuckner  \\n \\nSlide 5 – 1Q25 profitability driven by positive operating leverage in core business divisions  \\nThank you Sergio, and good morning everyone.   \\nThroughout my remarks, I’ll refer to underlying results in US dollars and make year -over-year comparisons, \\nunless stated otherwise.  \\nDuring the first quarter of 2025 our core businesses grew their combined pre -tax profitability by 15% on strong \\npositive operating leverage.  Overall, our Group profit before tax was 2.6 billion, down 1% year -on-year. Group \\nrevenues were broadly flat at 12 billion and up 6% across our core  franchises. Operating expenses were also \\nstable at 9.2 billion, as we continued to successfully reduce our non -production -related costs across the Group, \\noffsetting higher financial advisor and variable compensation accruals in the quarter.  \\nOur EPS was 51 cents and we delivered an 11.3% return on CET1 capital and a cost/income ratio of 77.4%.   \\nSlide 6 – 1Q25 demonstrates the strength of our diversified business model  \\nAs illustrated on slide 6, this quarter’s underlying performance demonstrates the strengt h of our franchise and \\ndiversified business model, particularly in challenging and complex markets.   \\nBy supporting clients in ways that differentiate UBS, while maintaining a sharp focus on cost and resource \\nefficiency, each of Global Wealth Management, Asset Management and the Investment Bank achieved double -\\ndigit pre -tax growth, absorbing net interest i ncome headwinds that in particular weighed on our Personal and \\nCorporate Banking business.  Our Non -core and Legacy unit delivered a strong first quarter, although short of \\nthe exceptional results of last year’s 1Q.  \\nOn a reported basis, our pre -tax profit of 2.1 billion included 700 million of revenue adjustments from \\nacquisition -related effects and 1.1 billion of integration expenses.   \\nOur effective tax rate in the quarter was 20%.  For 2Q, we expect a tax rate of around zero due to a capital -\\nneutral tax credit from further legal entity streamlining in the US and from other planning measures related to \\nthe integration.  We continue to expect our full -year 2025 effective tax rate to be around 20%, with a second -\\nhalf tax rate of around 30% influenced by NCL’s reported pre -tax performance.   \\nSlide 7 – Achieved 65% of gross cost save ambition, on track to ~13bn by year -end 2026  \\nTurning to our cost update on slide 7.   \\nIn the first three months of 2025, we achieved an additional 900 million in gross run -rate cost saves, bringing \\nthe cumulative total since the end of 2022 to 8.4 billion, or around 65% of our total gross cost save ambition.   \\nBy quarter -end, we had nominally decreased our overall cost base by around 10% from our 2022 baseline.  Yet \\nlooking -through variable compensation and litigation, and neutralizing for currency effects, we delivered an \\n \\n \\n Page 5 of 21 \\n \\n even greater net reduction in underlying expenses, exceeding 20%.  As a result, more than 50% of our \\ncumulative gross cost saves have translated into net saves that benefit our run -rate. \\nThe overall employee count fell sequentially by 2%, to 126 thousand, and by around 20% from our 2022 \\nbaseline.  \\nAs I’ve highlighted in the past, one of the keys to meeting our target cost -income ratio by the end of 2026 is \\nshutting down legacy Credit Suisse technology applications and infrastructure.  To date, we’ve retired over a \\nthird each of these applications, computer servers and data centers that are targeted in our plans for \\ndecommission.  These actions have generated more than 700 million in technology cost saves, with Non -core \\nand Legacy’s balance sheet reduction a key driver of this progress.  \\nWe expect that most of the remaining 4.5 billion in gross saves required to achieve our 13 billion target will \\ncome from reductions in technology, staffing and vendor costs.  As an example of what’s to come in the \\ntechnology context is a run -rate cost save of 800 million related to Credit Suisse’s leg acy applications in the \\nSwiss booking center, which we’ll decommission after the completion of the client account migration in 2026.   \\nSlide 8 – Our balance sheet for all seasons is a key pillar of our strategy  \\nTurning to slide 8.  As of the end of the first  quarter, our balance sheet for all seasons consisted of 1 -and-a-half \\ntrillion in total assets, with around 615 billion in loan balances, 745 billion in deposits, and a loan -to-deposit \\nratio of 80%.  \\nThe strength of our balance sheet is not just an essential component of our strategy, but a competitive \\nadvantage and source of confidence for our clients, especially during times of uncertainty.   \\nA fundamental driver of our balance sheet strength is our credit book. 93% of our lending positions are \\ncollateralized, with 57% of the total balance consisting of mortgages where the average LTV is 50%.  \\nAt the end of March, our lending book reflected credit -impaired exposures of 1%, unchanged from the prior \\nquarter.  The cost of risk decreased to 7 basis points as we recorded Group credit loss expenses of 100 million, \\nreflecting 121 million of net charges on credit -impaired positions and 21 million of net releases across our \\nperforming portfolio.  The net releases were due to our recalibration of the expected credit loss scenarios and \\nrebalancing of the factor weights.  \\nOnto liquidity and funding.  In the quarter, we made strong progress on our 2025 funding plan, already having \\ncompleted our AT1 issuances intended in 2025, in addition to having issued 3 billion in HoldCo debt.  I would \\nhighlight that our funding stability is underscored by the balanced currency mix across our assets and diversified \\nsources of long -term funding and deposits.   \\nOur average LCR was 181%, and remained around this level throughout April’s volatile markets.    \\n \\n \\n Page 6 of 21 \\n \\n Slide 9 – Maintaining a strong capital position with CET1 capital ratio at 14.3%  \\nTurning to capital on slide 9.  Our CET1 capital ratio at the end of March was 14.3%.   \\nAs a result of our continued progress with the integration, coupled with strong financial performance in the \\nfirst quarter, it is now our intention to execute on all of our 2025 capital return ambitions announced in \\nFebruary.  Consequently, our CET1 capital not only accounts for the 500 million in shares repurchased during \\nthe first three months of the year, but it also reflects the accrual of the remaining 2 and a half billion share \\nbuyback we intend to execute through the rest  of 2025, of which 500 million  in the second quarter.   \\nRisk-weighted assets fell by 15 billion sequentially, driven by lower asset size and the implementation of the \\nfinal Basel III standards, which ultimately resulted in a net reduction of 9 billion in RWA.   \\nThis revised amount reflects further infrastructure and data quality improvements finalized during the quarter, \\nas well as the effects of additional mitigation and de -risking actions we took across various credit, counterparty \\nand market risk categories.  After receiving regulatory approval, the final operational risk -weighted asset level \\nalso came in around 2 billion lower than our February estimate.  Netted within the overall reduction, FRTB led \\nto an increase of 6 billion, mainly related to the Investment Bank.  \\nAt the same time, despite the offsetting effects of mitigating actions, our leverage ratio denominator was \\n42 billion higher sequentially, resulting in a CET1 leverage ratio of 4.4%.  \\nThe uplift in LRD was driven by an increase of 29 billion from derivatives exposures now calculated under the \\nrevised Basel III standardized approach for counterparty credit risk.  With FX accounting for a 27 billion increase \\nin the quarter, these factors more than offset asset size reductions of 13 billion.  \\nA word on parent capital and Group equity double leverage. As of the end of March, our parent bank’s \\nstandalone CET1 capital ratio on a fully applied basis is expected to be 12.9%, within our target range.  The \\nsequential reduction reflects an accrual for dividends intended to be paid in 2026.  Over the next few quarters, \\nthe parent bank’s dividend -paying capacity is expected to be supported by both dividends and capital \\nrepatriations from subsidiaries.  \\nIn addition, earlier this month, as expected UBS AG paid a 6.5 billion ordinary dividend to our holding company.  \\nTaking into account capital returns to shareholders completed or anticipated during the first half of the year, \\nwe expect the Group’s equity double leverage ratio to improve to around 110% by the time we publish our \\nGroup stand -alone accounts at the end of  the second quarter.  \\nThese actions are consistent with our intention to restore the Group’s equity double leverage ratio towards pre -\\nacquisition levels over the next several quarters.   \\nSlide 10 – Global Wealth Management  \\nTurning to our business divisions, and starting with Global Wealth Management on slide 10.  \\nGWM’s pre -tax pr ofit was 1.5 billion, up 21% year -over-year as revenue growth outpaced expenses by 5 \\npercentage points.  This translated to a year -over-year improvement in GWM’s cost -income ratio of over 3 \\npercentage points to 75%.  \\n \\n \\n Page 7 of 21 \\n \\n In Asia, with our integration efforts now largely complete, we’re well -positioned to deliver our full range of \\ncapabilities to our clients.  Notably, our APAC franchise drove excellent PBT growth of 36%, on 14 points of \\npositive operating jaws and a pre -tax margin of over 40%.  In the Americas, where we’re executing on our \\ngrowth plans, we delivered PBT growth of more than 40% and a pre -tax margin of 12%. In addition, each of \\nour Switzerland and EMEA regions grew profits by 7% in the quarter.  \\nYou can find additional regional details, including a breakdown of revenue lines, credit loss expenses, net new \\ndeposits, and customer deposit balances, as well as comparatives across our four wealth regions, in our newly \\nenhanced disclosure in the quarter ly report and on page 22 in the appendix to this presentation.  \\nOnto flows. GWM invested assets increased by 1% sequentially with favorable currency effects and positive \\nasset flows offsetting negative market performance.  Net new assets in the quarter reached 32 billion, \\nrepresenting a 3% annualized growth rate with growth in all regions, led by the Americas, where strong same \\nstore performance supported NNA of 20 billion.  Our flow performance again this quarter reflects the actions \\nI’ve highlighted in the past regarding balance sheet optimization that support higher pr e-tax margins and \\nreturns on attributed equity, but at times come at the expense of net new assets.  \\nFor example, we again successfully managed the roll -off of preferential fixed term deposits associated with our \\n2023 win -back campaign.  Of the 54 billion in deposits maturing in 1Q, as in prior periods we converted around \\n85% into more profitable liquidity and investment solutions.  But some less profitable flows left the platform. \\nYou can see the clear improvement we’ve achieved in enhancing profitability from these balance sheet actions \\nin GWM’s revenue over RWA ratio, which has grown 2 points year over ye ar, and has reattained pre -acquisition \\nlevels.  \\nFurther evidence of clients seeking our market -leading advice and solutions and helping drive sustainable \\nrevenue growth is underscored by our net new fee generating asset performance of 27 billion in the quarter, a \\n6% annualized growth rate. We saw contin ued momentum in discretionary mandates, including SMAs in the \\nUS and our signature MyWay solution, delivered through our Swiss and international platforms.  MyWay \\nmandates have grown to 20 billion, up almost 80% from the prior year quarter.  \\nNNFGA growth was especially strong in our APAC franchise at an annualized growth rate of 10%, with \\nmandate penetration at its highest level on record.  \\nLooking ahead to the second quarter, while maturing fixed -term deposits are becoming a less material \\nheadwind to flows, seasonal US tax -related outflows in the high single -digit billion range, elevated as a result \\nof last year’s strong market performance, are expected to weigh on GWM’s 2Q net new assets.  \\nI would also highlight that we saw a modest pick -up in lending across the wealth business, with client re -\\nleveraging supported by a lower rate environment.  Net new loans were 2.2 billion, driven by Lombard lending \\nin APAC.  \\nTurning to revenues. GWM’s top line increased by 6%, driven by elevated client engagement, increased solution \\ntake-up by clients seeking diversification across geographies and asset classes, and higher average -asset levels.  \\nRecurring net fee income increased by 8% to 3.3 billion from positive market performance and over 70 billion \\nin net new fee -generating assets over the past 12 months.  Margins continued to hold up sequentially and are \\n \\n \\n Page 8 of 21 \\n \\n expected to remain around these levels, especially as recently migrated clients and those remaining on the \\nCredit Suisse platform now have access to the full breadth of our CIO value chain -led capabilities and solutions.  \\nTransaction -based income increased by 15% to 1.4 billion, in a market environment where our franchise’s \\nenduring advantages set us apart. Without a major shift in asset allocation during the quarter, clients \\nnevertheless actively repositioned portfolios, b enefitting from our investments in capabilities, solutions, and \\nunified teams.  This drove double -digit growth across Structured Products and Cash Equities, with Wealth \\nPlanning and Life Insurance up by more than 50%.  Alternatives were up 40%, fueled by the  joint Unified Global \\nAlternatives initiative with Asset Management.  \\nRegionally, we saw a continuation of transactional growth spanning the wealth franchise, led by APAC and the \\nAmericas, where transactional revenues increased by 28% and 16%, respectively.   \\nNet interest income at 1.5 billion was down 4% year -over-year and 7% quarter -over-quarter, with the \\nsequential trend reflecting a lower day count and headwinds from declining rates in Swiss franc and euro, \\npartially offset by ongoing balance sheet optimiza tion efforts.   \\nOf the sequential decline, 1 percentage point reflects a change to our client segmentation approach between \\nGWM and P&C that we implemented in February, but was not included in our guidance.  This change led to a \\nshift of some affluent clients from GWM to P&C, including loan balances of 8 billion.  Despite the modest effect \\non NII, we ultimately decided to not restate our accounts for this transfer, given the immaterial impact to the \\nP&L of both divisions overall.  \\nNow to our NII outlook.  For the second quarter of 2025, we expect GWM’s net interest income to decrease \\nsequentially by a low -single digit percentage, despite day count helping, primarily from lower Swiss franc and \\neuro rates after the March cuts.  We also expect a seasonal decline in client deposits following April tax payments \\nin the US, although there could be upside should clients maintain a more defensive posture amid ongoing \\nmarket uncertainty, driving higher sweep and account balances.  \\nFor full year 2025, we continue to expect GWM’s net interest income to decrease by a low single -digit \\npercentage compared to 2024.  \\nUnderlying operating expenses were up by 1%, with lower personnel and support costs offset by higher variable \\ncompensation tied to revenues.  Looking through variable compensation, litigation and currency effects, costs \\nwere down 5% year -over-year.  \\nSlide 11 – Personal & Corporate Banking (CHF)  \\nTurning to Personal & Corporate Banking on slide 11, where my comments will refer to Swiss francs.  \\nP&C delivered first quarter pre -tax profit of 597 million, down 23% as lower i nterest rates led to an 18% \\nreduction in net interest income.  \\nRecurring net fee income increased by 3% driven by record volumes of investment products in Personal Banking, \\nsupported by strong sales momentum, including a 12% annualized growth rate in net new investment flows \\nin the first quarter.  Transaction -based revenues decreased by 2% as strong performance in Personal Banking \\nwas more than offset by the effect of lower corporate finance activity amid softer economic conditions.   \\n \\n \\n Page 9 of 21 \\n \\n Sequentially, NII decreased by 7% largely reflecting the effects of the SNB’s 50 -basis point rate cut announced \\nin December and a lower day count, partly offset by the effect of the client segmentation shift between GWM \\nand P&C that I mentioned earlier, wh ich provided a 1 -percentage -point quarter -on-quarter uplift to P&C.  To \\nmitigate the effects of lower rates, we adjusted deposit pricing on select products and continued optimizing \\nour banking book.   \\nLooking to the second quarter, we see a sequential decrease in the low single -digit percentage range for P&C’s \\nNII in Swiss francs, which translates to a sequential mid single -digit percentage increase in US dollar terms, \\nbased on current FX rates.  The outlook is driven by last month’s SNB 25 -basis point rate cut, despite day count \\nhelping, and the latest change to the SNB’s threshold factor for remunerating sight deposits.  \\nFor full year 2025, we continue to expect an NII decline of around 10% versus 2024 in Swiss francs, translating \\nto a more modest reduction on a US dollar basis.  \\nCredit loss expense was 48 million, an 8 basis point cost of risk on an average loan portfolio of 245 billion.  This \\nincluded Stage 3 charges of 54 million, again predominantly from Credit Suisse exposures.   \\nReflecting on developing macroeconomic events, we currently assess that exposures to our more tariff -exposed \\ncorporate clients within our Swiss credit book are well -contained. On this basis, for full -year 2025, we continue \\nto expect P&C’s CLE to be around 350 million.  \\nThis said, we’re closely monitoring US tr ade policy developments and their first - and second -order impacts on \\nour Swiss loan exposures, thereby intending to update our credit loss expectations and allowances as and when \\nappropriate.   \\nP&C’s operating expenses in the quarter were 1.1 billion, down 4%.   \\nSlide 12 – Asset Management  \\nMoving to slide 12.  Asset Management drove a pre -tax profit of 208 million, up 15% year -on-year, with \\ndisciplined cost management more than compensating for lower revenues.   \\nNet management fees declined by 4%, as the effect  of higher average invested assets was more than offset by \\nmargin compression from clients having rotated into lower -margin products over recent periods. This said, we’re \\ngaining traction in delivering differentiated and higher margin products, including i n our Credit Investments \\nGroup, and in UGA, which saw strong net new commitments in the quarter and invested asset growth of 13% \\ncompared to a year ago.  \\nPerformance fees were 30 million, in line with the prior year, and with higher revenues from our credi t \\ncapabilities.  \\nNet new money was positive 7 billion, with strong flows in money market and active fixed income, as well as \\nsustained demand for SMAs, which saw inflows of 4.5 billion this quarter.  \\nOperating expenses were 10% lower as Asset Management re -tools for growth by continuing to make strong \\nprogress in streamlining its infrastructure and operating model.    \\n \\n \\n Page 10 of 21 \\n \\n Slide 13 – Investment Bank  \\nOn to slide 13 and the Investment Bank.   \\nIn the IB we delivered pre -tax profit of 696 million, up 72%, and a return  on attributed equity of 16%, all while \\nabsorbing incremental RWA from the implementation of the final Basel III FRTB rules.  \\nRevenues increased by 24% to 3 billion, driven by Global Markets, which posted its best quarter on record.   \\nBanking revenues decreased by 4% to 564 million, broadly in line with the fee pool.  While the market \\nenvironment weighed on our Banking results across products and regions, and despite growing economic \\nuncertainty, our pipeline continues to build.  We remained top 10 in announced M&A and saw continued \\nmomentum in our mandated deal book.  \\nIn Advisory, top -line growth was 17%, while Capital Markets revenues declined by 13%, mainly due to softer \\nsponsor activity.  In the Americas, the mix within the LCM fee pool shifted towards corporates and away from \\nsponsors, where we’re more concentrated.  In ECM, although the 1% revenue decrease outperformed the fee \\npool, we remain focused on our pipeline build, which is expected to yield meaningful returns over the medium -\\nterm.  \\nRegionally, APAC grew its overall Banking revenues by over 70% compared to the prior year quarter and \\ndelivered its best first quarter on record in M&A.  \\nRevenues in Markets increased by 32% to 2.5 billion.  Against a market backdrop of elevated activity and \\nvolatility in Equities and FX, where our IB  is more concentrated, we capitalized on the enhanced capabilities \\nacquired with Credit Suisse and our multi -year investments in technology.  \\nWe saw increases across all regions, with the Americas, APAC and Switzerland each delive ring their best \\nquarterly performance on record.   \\nEquities revenues reached a new high, driven by Equity Derivatives, with increases across all regions and \\nsupported by Cash Equities and Prime Brokerage.  FRC increased by 27%, primarily driven by FX.   \\nOperating expenses rose by 14%, largely reflecting increases in personnel expenses.   \\nSlide 14 – Non-core and Legacy  \\nOn slide 14, Non -core and Legacy’s pre -tax loss was 200 million with 284 million in revenues.   \\nFunding costs of around 130 million were more tha n offset by revenues from position exits, particularly in \\nstructured products.  This included the expected gain of around 100 million from closing the sale of Credit \\nSuisse’s US mortgage servicing company announced last year, which also eliminates run rate costs of around \\n100 million per annum.  \\nOperating expenses were down 38% year -on-year and 12% sequentially, as NCL continues to make excellent \\nprogress in driving out costs.  \\n \\n \\n Page 11 of 21 \\n \\n For the remainder of the year, we expect NCL to generate an underlying pre -tax loss, excluding litigation, of \\naround 1.7 billion, including revenues of around negative 300 million, mainly from funding costs.  Revenues \\nfrom carry, continued exits and remaining fair value positions are expected to net around zero, and underlying \\noperating expenses should average around 450 million per quarter.   \\nWhile the current environment may slow the pace of exits, it is unlikely to materially affect the financial \\nperformance of our NCL portfolio.  As examples, hedges in the macro book, and the nature of  our now much \\nsmaller credit book, render the valuation of both portfolios less susceptible to market volatility.   \\nSlide 15 – NCL run down continuing at pace  \\nNow onto Slide 15.  Since the second quarter of 2023, Non -core and Legacy has freed up almost 7 bil lion of \\ncapital, reduced its cost base by over 60% and closed 74% of the 14 thousand books they started with.  \\nAs of the end of March, risk -weighted assets in NCL were 7 billion lower than in the prior quarter, as position \\nexits across securitized products, credit and macro more than offset the inflationary effects of the final Basel III \\nstandards.   \\nAgain this quarter, the skillful expertise of the NCL team has kept us well ahead of our de -risking schedule.  \\nGiven this accelerated progress, we’re upgrading our ambitions and now aim to drive NCL’s credit and market \\nrisk RWA below 8 billion by the end of 2025, and to around 4 billion by the end of 2026.  \\nWhile we expect the reduction in balance sheet to continue to contribute to NCL’s cost performance, as I’ve \\nhighlighted in the past, further savings from technology, real estate and resolving ongoing litigation matters \\nwill take longer to achieve.  This underpins our 2026 exit -rate cost guidance I offered last quarter.  \\nWith that, let’s open for questions.  \\n \\n \\n Page 12 of 21 \\n \\n Analyst Q&A (CEO and CFO)  \\nJeremy Sigee , Exane  BNP Paribas  \\nGood morning. Thanks very much. Firstly, just a basic one. The fact that you're accruing the whole of the \\n2025 share buyback suggests that you intend to do that almost regardless of what the draft rules look like \\nwhen they ’re published in June. Is that a fair interpretation?  \\nAnd then my second question is a bit broader. Could you talk about how your wealth management clients \\nin different regions are reacting in April post the tariffs in the US? Are they doing more with the bank or \\nless with the bank? What are their risk appeti tes? If you could talk about that, that would be great. Thank \\nyou. \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nThank you, Jeremy. No, it is not a fair representation considering what I said, that our language hasn't \\nchanged and we said, very clearly that we are accruing based on what we know and we see today, based \\non our strong performance, based on our strong cap ital position. That, of course, all of this is subject to us \\ncontinuing to develop, well, in terms of financial targets, the integration, and as we pointed out, any \\nmaterial and immediate change in the regulatory regime.  \\nSo, in respect of the activity in April, I can only say that of course, we had a, as I mentioned in my remarks, \\nwe saw a huge spike in client activity and volatility in the first couple of weeks in the first few days of April. \\nSo, even achieving a 30% incr ease compared to the peak of COVID times, which is quite exceptional. But \\nit's fair to say that if you look at the last 10 days or so, there is a fatigue coming in. You'd see it also in \\nfinancial markets. I think that markets are stabilizing around current  levels across many asset classes and it's \\nmuch more of a wait -and-see attitude and so in that sense it's a more normalized environment.  \\nJeremy Sigee , Exane  BNP Paribas  \\nThank you.  \\n \\nGiulia Aurora Miotto , Morgan Stanley  \\nYes. Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. So, the first one, I was surprised to hear that \\nthere is re -leveraging in Asia. That's quite a positive development. And I was wondering if that has carried \\nthrough also in April or was it only a Q1 phenomenon, and then got shutdown by the tariff discussion.  \\nAnd then the second question instead, of course, I have to ask on capital, and May is the next catalyst \\nthere, or at least we will learn something there. Is there any development that you can share with us in \\nterms of what to expect, and what will go under government ordinance, what will be put to parliament, \\nyeah, any updated thoughts would be helpful. Thank you.   \\n \\n \\n Page 13 of 21 \\n \\n Sergio P. Ermotti  \\nLet me pick up the second one, and Todd will pick up the first question. There are no developments other \\nthan the updated timeline for the announcement of the proposal that are now seen, are going to come in \\nduring the first week  [edit: weeks ] of June. So, we don't know what's the content of this proposal in terms \\nof – also, if there is any split between ordinance or legislative process. So, we are in a wait -and-see and we \\nwill see like everybody in five to six weeks' time.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nAnd Giulia, I'd say it's helpful to step back and look at the bigger picture here, on the lending question. I \\nmean, clearly for GWM, one of our strategic imperatives is to grow lending, albeit selectively and profitably. \\nAnd as a driver of enhanced relatio nship revenues for clients, so we're pleased with the developments that \\nwe saw in 1Q. I mean, we can't speculate on where things are going to move given the current \\nenvironment for sure. But we're pleased with the 1Q performance, and that still remains a s trategic focus \\nfor us.  \\nGiulia Aurora Miotto , Morgan Stanley  \\nThank you.  \\n \\nKian Abouhossein , JPMorgan  \\nYes. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to come back to US wealth management. If you could \\nmaybe run – you clearly have done some strategic changes around the US wealth management business, \\nboth on compensation, but also incentives, et cetera. And if  I look on a year -end basis versus now, you \\nhave reductions in advisers. I just wanted to see where should we think adviser numbers to go to in US \\nwealth. And how should we  think around the net new flows but also impact in that respect because you \\nmade some statements in the last quarter that could be a deterioration, but also in terms of improvement \\nin pre -tax margin. So, a bit more of a holistic approach around the changes that you have done and the \\nimpact.  \\nAnd then secondly, just coming back to the Federal Council report, can you just take a step back and just \\ngive your current views around your positioning against other banks, but also potential offsets that you can \\nthink about in order to offset some kind of additional capital requirement, even in big picture terms, if you \\ncould talk about t hat? \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nHi, Kian. So, on the wealth one, let's zoom out a bit and just reiterate that we're executing at pace on our \\nplans and our strategy. You know, clearly, quarter -on-quarter, we could see volatility. But this said, we're \\nlooking at our ambition to achieve, as y ou know, a structural mid -teen pre -tax margin. And we look at that \\nas a two to three -year journey.  \\nAs we zoom in, the question on really our platforms and advisers, first, I'd say our platform is stable. There's \\nbeen a broad support for our strategy, which is intended to better align advisor incentives with the strategic \\n \\n \\n Page 14 of 21 \\n \\n goals of the firm. That's evidenced by the very strong same -store net new money we've seen, perhaps the \\nstrongest net new money we've seen over many quarters in the first quarter.  \\nIn terms of the head count, I would just say that our recruiting pipeline is robust. There is some attrition \\nthat one can expect. And in fact, we're observing across the industry, given the market dynamics of 2024 \\nversus the beginning of 2025 and the outlo ok that would create some movement across the industry in \\nterms of advisory repositioning. But nothing I would highlight in our own platform.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nKian, before I answer the question, can you specify what do you mean by positioning versus other banks?  \\nKian Abouhossein , JPMorgan  \\nYes, Sergio. I left it open on purpose, just to see, leaving the floor open to some extent.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nOkay.  \\nKian Abouhossein , JPMorgan  \\nTo see what – yeah, what you can tell us and your thoughts about it, because it is clearly a very open \\nquestion. It's very difficult for us to look through as well.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nBut you know, Kian, the call is scheduled to and at 10:30, so I'm not so sure I have so much time to go \\nthrough that. So, but so the issue is very clear that , when I look at the regulatory framework in Switzerland, \\nit's one of the  most demanding. And particularly after we fully implemented Basel III, I think that in terms of \\nrelative game , that we are comfortable at, that we have a strong and demanding regime. That capital and \\nstrength is one of our key pillars.  \\nHaving said that, we all know that there is a point in time in which too much is not necessarily positive. And \\ntherefore that's the only consideration I can say when we speak about relative terms. So, because at the \\nend of the day, as we always say, we are  not only competing in terms of return on capital, but we are also \\ncompeting for capital. And therefore, having an attractive, sustainable business that also delivers \\nappropriate return is a key element on judging and balancing any regulatory regime. That' s what I can say.  \\nSo, in respect of set of measures, the set of measures can only be decided and analyzed when you know \\nwhat is the outcome. And so, we will need to assess exactly what the proposal is in terms of impact and \\ntiming.  \\nKian Abouhossein , JPMorgan  \\nAnd Sergio, just very quickly, do you expect enough clarity to assess with that report?  \\n \\n \\n Page 15 of 21 \\n \\n Sergio P. Ermotti  \\nI hope, I don't expect.  \\nKian Abouhossein , JPMorgan Securities  \\nOkay. Thank you.  \\n \\nStefan Stalmann , Bernstein Autonomous  \\nHi. Good morning. Thank you very much for taking my questions. I have two on capital, please. The first \\none on the parent bank, the fully loaded CET1 ratio was I think down by about 60 basis points during the \\nquarter. Was there anything particular to highl ight that happened during the quarter?  \\nAnd the second one, a bit more, let's say, strategic. The risk density in the group has actually come down \\nquite a bit. And it's now a bit below 31%. And I think the hope was always in a way that Basel IV would \\nkind of lift this risk density towards 35%, w here it doesn't matter anymore whether leverage or risk -\\nweighted assets drive your capital requirement. But now it's 31%, it looks like you're quite deeply \\nconstrained by leverage, not risk weighted -assets going forward. Do you expect this to change at all  from \\nwhat you can see? And if not, does it have any impact on the way that you run your capital management \\ngoing forward?  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nThanks. Thanks, Stefan, for those questions. I appreciate you bringing those up. So, first on the capital, the \\nparent bank quarter -on-quarter reduction, as I mentioned in my comments comes from the accrual of a \\ndividend that we expect to pay in 2026 in rel ation to 2025, overall earnings of the parent bank. So, it's a \\ndividend accrual that effectively drove the capital ratio within our guidance.  \\nOn the second one, it's a very good spot on your point about risk density coming in. You know, I would \\nsay, you're also right where I would say more constrained by leverage than risk weighting. But remember \\nthat we set our CET1 capital ratio on a risk -weighted basis as our key target. So, in that sense, that \\nbecomes for us binding unless truly leverage becomes binding.  \\nBut to answer your question about what you can do about it or what the cause was or is I would say that, \\nyou see how we've been able to really drive down RWA because of the technical nature of it, in the way \\nwe've been able to manage down work …also work to get approvals on models, on methodology, on data \\nquality, on all the issues, the coverage of external ratings, all the things that have helped us drive down.  \\nI think the leverage ratio, unfortunately, is just more simple, less fertile ground for optimization. And so, \\nyou saw, as I commented that we had the SACCR increase, whereas on RWA we had a more fertile ground \\nto optimize. So, I think your observation is correct, but I don't see it this time given we intend to operate \\nwith a CET1 capital ratio of around 14%, which for us is binding, even though you're right,  leverage is – \\nwe have less cushion on the leverage side than we do on the risk -weighted side going .... Nothing is \\nchanging as we move forward. That's the way we're thinking about it.  \\n \\n \\n Page 16 of 21 \\n \\n Stefan Stalmann , Bernstein Autonomous  \\nOkay. Thank you very much.  \\nBenjamin Goy , Deutsche Bank  \\nYes. Hi. Good morning. Two questions, please, from my side. First on your India partnership, maybe you \\ncan comment a bit more broader on the onshore, offshore dynamics we should expect in emerging markets \\ngoing forward, even in a large market like India, you have t o do a partnership.  \\nAnd then secondly, markets are now pricing in again, negative rates in Switzerland. Just wondering, short -\\nterm, any impact or , below zero, if there's not much like an incremental negative impact. The longer -term \\nquestion is the 50% cost to income ratio target in your Swiss business was, I assume done or based on a \\nmore  positive interest rate outlook and how do you intend to achieve that or is more due to come out  on \\nthe cost side? The longer -term question is the 50% cost to income ratio target in your Swiss business was, I \\nassume done or based on a more  positive interest rate outlook and how do you intend to achieve that or \\nmore due to come out  on the cost side? Thank you.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nYeah. Hi Benjamin, let me address the second question. So, on your observation regarding the market \\npricing and negative rates, as we indicate  in our interest rate sensitivity and as I've commented before, we \\ncertainly see convexity in the movement of rates either down or up, in the sense that whether rates move \\ninto negative territory or move up, that would be accretive to our net interest inco me in our P&C business. \\nSo, in that sense to the extent that is priced in and to the extent that actually happens , we see upside in our \\nNII. \\nYou asked about the expectation on the cost/income ratio targets that we have by the end of 2026. I \\nwould say it's we continue to execute against that expectation. That is our expectation at this stage. Not \\nchanging that given interest rate expectations at  this point in time.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nSo, on India I think that we see a secular trend developing for the Indian market domestically and but also \\nat the same time, we see also an opportunity for India residents booking business outside. And looking at \\nour current setup, we saw that , we decided that the best way to pursue the next phase of growth and \\ngrowth opportunities in India for us was to partner with the only fully independent asset gatherer in India. \\nAnd so through that, through the combination of us buying a stake, but also bri nging our current business \\ninto 360, we can now leverage for the future.  \\nSo, we see very good prospects across the board in terms of not only sharing our best practice globally, but \\nalso learning on the domestic markets. And we'll take it from there. So, I think that we are very optimistic \\nabout the long -term potential growth i n India.  \\nBenjamin Goy, Deutsche Bank  \\nThank you.  \\n \\n \\n Page 17 of 21 \\n \\n  \\nAmit Goel , Mediobanca  \\nHi. Thank you. And maybe just more of a follow -up question, but just the remarks earlier about the equity \\ndouble leverage and kind of looking to get down to the 110% at Q2. And then continue to bring it back to \\npre-acquisition levels in the quarters after.  I'm still kind of curious , why ? What drives the pace of that, and \\nkind of , what's the cost or what's the consequence if you were to stay at 110 %? Because  let's say if the \\ngroup were to have less leverage at the parent bank level, what would stop the group having a bit more \\nleverage at the group? And what would be the consequence , or what is the benefit of bringing that down \\nfrom 110% to say 105% or 100%? So, that's the question there.  \\nAnd then just on the PCB business, again  I appreciate the response on if rates, for example, if they were to \\ngo negative, et cetera, the convexity. I'm just wondering what you're thinking about volumes there given \\nthe exchange rate movement. Any color would be helpful. Thank you.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nThanks, Amit. So, on the first, your question in terms of the consequence of a higher one or the benefit of \\nthe lower one for sure, the way we look at it is a lower one, which is to say our pre -acquisition levels, the \\nway we've historically operated. One i s more prudent. It's aligned with our strategy. And third, it just offers \\nfar more flexibility. So, if you operate at a higher level and then you hit any stress, then you've effectively \\nsold your buffer, and so that's the reason why it's prudent to operate  at the levels that Sergio and I have \\nbeen highlighting over the last quarter or two , since I raised the topic last quarter.  \\nIn terms of P&C volumes. As we look , we look forward, I would say, at this point, the outlook on lending is \\nflattish for now in terms of volumes and ways that if that is a mitigant for sure, the balance sheet \\noptimization that they've done, that the business has done on the asset side, has d riven profitability, return \\non attributed equity, revenue over RWA, accretion , appreciation. So, I would say that's the main focus on \\nthe lending side.  \\nDeposit outlook is also relatively flattish, maybe some short -term moderate down a bit in a very competitive \\nmarket  and we're not chasing  where w e're seeing competitors buying deposits at much higher rates to \\nprotect their loan books. So, our deposit outlook is stable , I would say. But again, there we have adjusted \\ndeposit pricing on select products to help. But at the end of the day, as I've said before, certainly the \\nbiggest help would be rates either moving down or up from a sort of a zero perimeter as that would rea lly \\nbe the most accretive from a NII perspective in the P&C business.  \\nAmit Goel , Mediobanca  \\nThank you.  \\nAndrew Coombs , Citigroup  \\nHi. Good morning. I have two follow -ups, please. One on capital and one on GWM NII. On capital, coming \\nall the way back to Jeremy's first question, you've taken a change in approach. You've fully accrued for the \\nbuyback rather than taking the capital impact as and when you execute. And can I just ask what was the \\nrationale for doing this? And is this something you envisage doing going forward , as well?  \\n \\n \\n Page 18 of 21 \\n \\n And the second question on GWM NII, and I think at the full year results, you talked about Q1 being down \\nlow- to mid -single digits sequentially. You've ended up down 7%. And you said that 1 percentage point of \\nthat was due to the re -segmentation. But nonet heless, it looks a little bit worse than your original guidance. \\nSo, perhaps you could explain why it came in slightly worse than you initially expected?  \\nAnd then more broadly, your full year guidance for GWM NII is unchanged. But it was previously predicated \\non the second half being flattish versus the first half. Are you now seeing a slight recovery in the second \\nhalf?  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nSo, thank you, Andrew. So, on capital, again, I think that's, the main driver here is to also manage our ratio \\nin respect of our guidance. And by doing the accruals, we basically take it closer to our “ around 14 %.” But \\nmost importantly, I think that's the real factor that has changed is that we moved from having an ambition \\nto having an intention to.  \\nI mean, this is all still subject to the conditions we always set in terms of financial performance. And also, \\nno material  and immediate change in the regulatory framework. But it's clear that now we have – because \\nof the results and the progress we are making in the integration , and everything that we can control, we \\nfeel comfortable that this is the way to go.  \\nSo, you can always expect that as soon as we feel that there is a change between ambition and intention , \\nalso, from a accounting standpoint of view, we will accrue in a prudent manner which we believe is also \\nmore prudent – that kind of reserve , then  in order to then execute on capital return plans.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nAnd Andrew, on the second question. Yeah, the reason I gave some color on the segmentation change is, \\nis just to explain a bit of the delta. But with that explained, you kind of get into the mid -single -digit range, \\nwhich is where we've guided into 1Q seque ntially from 4Q.  \\nIn terms of the outlook, going forward, you're right. I mean, I'm reaffirming the full year NII guidance for \\nGWM. I see the loan outlook to be, again, dependent on the rate environment, but the loan outlook to be \\npositive , also dependent on the macroeconomic environment. But that right now , until we see any drastic \\nchange, the loan outlook has been accretive on the NII in terms of the rest of the year for GWM.  \\nAnd also, the deposit outlook is helping as well, again, subject to macroeconomic developments. But we \\nalso see some of the preferential FTD headwinds tapering. And so ultimately this is contributing as well to \\ndeposit margins increasing. So, for those rea sons, I've kept the guidance stable for the full year. And as I \\nsaid, offered the explain to sort of move into the Q1 guidance range.  \\nAndrew Coombs , Citigroup  \\nThat's great. Thank you, both.  \\nChris Hallam , Goldman Sachs  \\nYeah. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for taking my questions. You mentioned in the prepared \\n \\n \\n Page 19 of 21 \\n \\n remarks the LCM fee pool shifted towards corporates and away from sponsors. Any insights you can share \\non your discussions with the sponsor community more broadly, how do you expect them to act in the \\ncoming quarters based on the operating backdrop we see today? And maybe at what point would you \\nconsider reassessing the banking revenue ambition for 2026 ? I guess, in light of the slower activity levels \\nyear to date?  \\nAnd then second, I just want to come back on this risk of an immediate and material change to the \\nregulatory regime. So, I appreciate the processes is maybe less clear than it was, the range of outcomes has \\nprobably widened, but has the risk of immediacy a lso increased? It feels as though, if anything stuff is being \\npushed to the right a little bit, and obviously there hopefully would be still some kind of phase in period, \\none would assume, so just any thoughts on that. Thank you.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nWell, look, I think that generally speaking it's … On a year -on-year basis, the drop in the sponsor -related \\nactivity was more important , but I would say that in general, the sponsors are also like everybody on a wait \\nand see attitude. A lot of transactions are on hold. They are not necessarily being canceled. Of course, if \\nyou look at, to some extent the view levels of funding and spreads and credit markets may put some \\ntransaction at , in question. But , generally speaking the sense is that people are waiting to see if the \\nsituation clarifies in the next couple of months  and then they're going to go into executing on plans for \\neither add -on acquisitions or disposals, IPOs. So, I think that the most important issue that we see right now \\nis that the pipeline of potential transaction is still healthy and building up. So, we don' t see a stop on that.  \\nSo, coming to your question, I think that when we would change our outlook for the over -the-cycle and \\nambitions on the top line is going to be when , if, we have a material change in the market conditions and \\nin the prospect for  the growth of banking businesses in the industry. Our intention to be a relative winner \\nout of it by gaining share of wallet remains unchanged. So, if we have to change our revenue assumptions, \\nwe're definitely not going to change our market share ambition s to improve and monetize on the \\ninvestments we did on the platform in the last 24 months.  \\nIn respect of the second one, I mean, look, it's just prudent  – we are not in control of this process. We \\ndon't know what's coming out. And so, we can't rule out anything in terms of the materiality of the \\nchange , and the timing. Therefore, you have to interpret this language more as a prudent way to highlight \\nthat we are – that that's a possibility, that doesn't necessarily reflect what we expect or don't expect.  \\nChris Hallam , Goldman Sachs  \\nOkay. Thanks, Sergio.  \\n \\nPiers Brown , HSBC  \\nYeah. Good morning. I've got two. One on FRC, so up 27% year -on-year. It's much stronger print than a \\nlot of your peers. And I'm just wondering, is that business mix related? You've mentioned the strength of \\nFX, or do you feel that you're still winning bac k market share in that business?  \\nAnd then the second question, sorry to come back on capital again, but you did say in the fourth quarter \\n \\n \\n Page 20 of 21 \\n \\n that you had further subsidiary repatriations potentially in the pipeline. I think you mentioned $5 billion \\nfrom CSI and maybe something more coming out of the IHC. Can you give an update on progress on both \\nof those fronts? Thanks.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nHi, Piers. So, on the first question, yeah, the pickup in FRC year -on-year was driven by FX where we're \\nstrong, concentrated. You know we had … it was a difficult quarter, I think for those that are more in rates \\nand credit. And we're, as you know, under concentrated there, so we didn't have that impact, so we \\nbenefited from where we were well indexed in the FRC segment.  \\nOn the capital question, in terms of an update, yes, you recall correctly that there remains additional capital \\nto be repatriated out of some of the foreign subs, in particular the UK one. And a bit more as well in the \\nUS. \\nWe're going through the normal process with the regulators to approve the release of their capital, which is \\nto say that we continue to work down the portfolios, largely non -core and legacy portfolios , in those \\nentities. And as we continue to make progress and that capital is indeed excess, including from a \\nsupervisory standpoint, under their conservative lens, they'll give us the – they’ll  signal the okay and then \\nwe'll repatriate that , over the course of the next several quarters.  \\nPiers Brown , HSBC  \\nAll right. That's great. Thank you.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nThank you. So, there are no more questions. So, thank you for calling in and for your questions. And the IR \\nteam is at your disposal for any follow -ups. So have a nice day. Thank you.  \\n  \\n \\n \\n Page 21 of 21 \\n \\n Cautionary statement regarding forward -looking statements | This document  contains statements that constitute “forward -looking statements”, \\nincluding but not limited to management’s outlook for UBS’s financial performance, statements relating to the anticipated eff ect of transactions and \\nstrategic initiatives on UBS’s business a nd future development and goals or intentions to achieve climate, sustainability and other social objectives. While \\nthese forward -looking statements represent UBS’s judgments, expectations and objectives concerning the matters described, a number of risks , uncertainties \\nand other important factors could cause actual developments and results to differ materially from UBS’s expectations. In part icular, the global economy may \\nsuffer significant adverse effects from increasing political tensions between world p owers, changes to international trade policies, including those related \\nto tariffs and trade barriers, and ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, as well as the continuing Russia –Ukraine war. UBS’s acquisition of the Credit Suisse \\nGroup has materially chang ed its outlook and strategic direction and introduced new operational challenges. The integration of the Credit Suisse entiti es \\ninto the UBS structure is expected to continue through 2026 and presents significant operational and execution risk, includin g the risks that UBS may be \\nunable to achieve the cost reductions and business benefits contemplated by the transaction, that it may incur higher costs t o execute the integration of \\nCredit Suisse and that the acquired business may have greater risks or liabil ities than expected. Following the failure of Credit Suisse, Switzerland is \\nconsidering significant changes to its capital, resolution and regulatory regime, which, if proposed and adopted, may signifi cantly increase our capital \\nrequirements or impose othe r costs on UBS. These factors create greater uncertainty about forward -looking statements. Other factors that may affect UBS’s \\nperformance and ability to achieve its plans, outlook and other objectives also include, but are not limited to: (i) the degr ee to which UBS is successful in \\nthe execution of its strategic plans, including its cost reduction and efficiency initiatives and its ability to manage its l evels of risk -weighted assets (RWA) and \\nleverage ratio denominator (LRD), liquidity coverage ratio and  other financial resources, including changes in RWA assets and liabilities arising from higher \\nmarket volatility and the size of the combined Group;

Materials and a webcast \\nreplay are available at www.ubs.com/investors   \\n \\n \\nSergio P. Ermotti \\n \\nSlide 3 – Key messages  \\nThank you, Sarah and good morning, everyone.  \\nOur strong financial performance in the quarter, with a net profit of 1.4 billion and an underlying PBT of 2.4 \\nbillion, together with our year -to-date results, demonstrates the power of our unique client franchises, \\ndiversified business model and global scale.   \\nIt also represents continued progress on the integration. This brings us two important benefits.  \\nFirst, it increases our confidence level in achieving our short - and medium -term financial targets.  \\nSecond, it allows us to offer the full range of services of the combined bank, and to stay even closer to clients. \\nWe are better positioned than ever to help them navigate a market background that, while constructive, still \\nexhibits periods of high volatility and dislocation.  \\nOur commitment to serving clients is reflected in a 9% year- on-year increase in underlying revenues, with \\nnotable strength in the Americas and APAC.  \\nInvested assets across the Group increased by 15% year- on-year to 6.2 trillion. This shows that our wealth and \\nasset management clients continue to value the capabilities we provide across our advice platform and the way in which we consistently innovate t o meet their needs.  \\nOne excellent example is the positive client and General Partner reaction to the launch of our Unified Global Alternatives unit, which has created a top -5 player in Alternatives.  \\nIn Switzerland, while we faced the expected headwinds on Net Interest Income, we continued to deliver on our commitment to acting as a safe and reliable provider of credit to the economy, with around 35 billion Swiss \\nfrancs of loans granted or renewed in t he quarter.  \\n \\n Page 2 of 22 \\n Within the Investment Bank, our investments in Global Markets supported robust performance in Equities, \\nnotably in the Americas.  \\nAnd in Global Banking, we maintained our momentum in Advisory as we outperformed the global M&A fee \\npools for the third consecutive quarter. As importantly, our M&A pipeline continues to build.  \\nTurning back to the integration. The finalization of our preparation work during the quarter allowed us, in the \\nlast two weeks of October, to successfully achieve another milestone. We moved all of the client accounts and \\ndata in Luxembourg and Hong Kong o nto UBS platforms.  \\nThe next significant milestones for 2024 are the client account migrations in Singapore and Japan, expected by year-end. We will then kick- off the next phase of Swiss migrations in the second quarter of 2025, positioning \\nus well to enhance the client exper ience and unlock further cost reductions towards the end of 2025 and into \\n2026.  \\nIn Non- core and Legacy, we continue to simplify our operations through book closures and the \\ndecommissioning of applications. This has supported the significant year -to-date reductions in costs.  \\nAnd thanks to our active wind- down efforts, the natural runoff profile of the remaining positions is already in \\nline with our 2026 risk -weighted asset ambition. At the same time, we remain focused on identifying \\nopportunities to further improve the rundown profile, but will continue to do so without compromising \\neconomic value creation.  \\nThe overall disciplined progress on the integration, including the completion of the legal entity mergers, has \\nsignificantly mitigated the execution risk of the Credit Suisse acquisition.  \\nThis, combined with the strong performance of our businesses, has allowed us to generate capital well ahead of our plan and guidance.  \\nAs we prudently assess future capital requirements, business plans and profitability for the coming years, we feel it is important our current Group capital position better reflects excess capital available for growth and \\nreturns to shareholders.  \\nConsequently, we have voluntarily accelerated the phase -out of the remaining transitional capital adjustments \\nagreed with our regulator, which we had disclosed upon the closing of the acquisition.  \\nThis brings our CET1 capital ratio to 14.3%, more in line with our guidance while maintaining a strong capital \\nposition and a balance sheet for all seasons.  \\nThis buffer was never considered for distribution and its removal has no impact on our ability to execute on the \\nongoing 2024 share buyback, nor on our medium -term ambitions for dividends and buybacks.  \\nAs already communicated, we will provide more detail on our 2025 capital return plans, including the continued execution of buybacks, with our fourth- quarter results.  \\nOur ambition for 2026 capital returns to exceed pre -acquisition levels is unchanged, subject to our assessment \\nof any proposed requirements from Switzerland’s ongoing review of its capital regime.  \\n \\n Page 3 of 22 \\n I want to emphasize that our focus extends beyond meeting the current needs of our clients, executing on the \\nintegration and delivering on our short -term plans.  \\nWe are also preparing for the future by continuing to invest in our people, products and capabilities to \\nstrengthen our client offerings and position our businesses for long- term growth.  \\nThis includes investing in our industry -leading cloud infrastructure as well as our expertise in artificial intelligence \\nand automation. This will accelerate Generative AI adoption, increasing efficiency and effectiveness.  \\nOne example of the many ways we are leveraging AI is through Microsoft Copilot. With 50,000 licenses being \\nrolled out between now and the end of the first quarter, we are implementing the largest deployment of Copilot \\nwithin the global financial services i ndustry to date.  \\nAnother example is Red, a proprietary new AI assistant that provides 20,000 employees in Switzerland, Hong \\nKong, and Singapore with easy access to UBS product information and investment research.  \\nIn the Investment Bank, we are piloting a proprietary AI algorithm that researches and compiles potential merger \\nand acquisition buy -side targets.  \\nIn these, and the many other AI deployments that are underway across the entire firm, we are focused on \\nresponsible AI as we provide our people with tools that will help them better manage their businesses.  \\nEven as new technology is changing the way we work, our people will remain the most important driver of our \\nsuccess.  \\nThat is why I am particularly pleased with the positive results from a recent employee survey which, by the way, is an important testament to the progress we have made on the integration.  \\n84% say they are proud to work for UBS, and 83% would recommend UBS as an employer – both well above \\nindustry benchmarks.  \\nWe have achieved a lot over the last 18 months as we are building a stronger and even safer version of UBS \\nthat all of our key stakeholders can be proud of.  \\nBut there is no room for complacency. We are just about halfway to restoring pre -acquisition levels of profits \\nand returns on capital and the journey won’t be a straight line.  \\nIn the short -term, in addition to seasonality, ongoing global macroeconomic developments, geopolitical \\nconflicts and the upcoming US elections create uncertainties that are likely to affect investor behavior.  \\nWe continue to help clients navigate this environment, and I remain confident in  our ability to deliver on our \\nfinancial targets as we position UBS for long -term, sustainable growth and remain a pillar of economic support \\nin the communities where we live and work.  \\nWith that, I hand over to Todd. \\n  \\n \\n Page 4 of 22 \\n Todd Tuckner  \\n \\nSlide 5 – Strong revenue momentum with lower costs driving positive operating leverage  \\nThank you Sergio, and good morning everyone.  \\nThroughout my remarks, I will refer to underlying results in US dollars unless stated otherwise.  \\nAlso, starting today, I compare our performance to the prior -year quarter since we now have fully comparable \\nyear- over-year information for the first time since the Credit Suisse acquisition last year.  I continue to offer \\nsequential insights on balance sheet, net interest income developments, and our progress towards achieving \\nour gross cost save targets by the end of 2026.   \\nStarting on slide 5.  Profit before tax in the quarter increased over two -and- half times to 2.4  billion with strong \\noperating leverage improvement year- over-year, contributing to a return on CET1 capital of 9.4%.  \\nTotal revenues rose by 9% to 11.7 billion driven by momentum in our asset gathering businesses and \\nInvestment Bank. At the same time, operating expenses declined by 4% to 9.2  billion as we continued to \\nexecute on our integration and efficiency plans.  \\nThese results also contribute to a strong year- to-date performance, with a 9 -month pre -tax profit of 7.1  billion \\nand a return on CET1 capital of 9.2%.  \\nSlide 6 – 3Q24 net profit 1.4bn, while integration continues at pace  \\nTurning to slide 6, which illustrates our progress in improving profitability over the last year.   \\nThe net profit for the quarter was 1.4 billion with an EPS of 43 cents.   \\nAs illustrated on the slide, the increase in underlying pre -tax profit was driven by higher revenues paired with \\nlower costs and CLE.  \\nOn a reported basis, PBT was 1.9  billion including 0.7 billion of purchase price allocation adjustments  in our \\ncore businesses , and integration- related expenses of 1.1  billion.  \\nOur tax expense in the third quarter was 502 million, representing an effective rate of 26%.   \\nFor the fourth quarter, we expect additional revenues from purchase price allocation adjustments of 0.5 billion, \\nintegration -related expenses of 1.2  billion and an effective tax rate of around 35%.  \\nSlide 7 – Underlying operating expenses flat QoQ excluding currency effects  \\nTurning to our quarterly cost update on slide 7.   \\nOperating expenses increased by 2% quarter -on-quarter, and were flat excluding the effects of US dollar \\nsoftness against the Swiss franc and pound Sterling, in which we incur substantial personnel costs.  When also \\nexcluding increased variable compensation linked to revenues and lower litigation reserve releases, operating expenses reduced by around 200 million sequentially, or 2%.  This was supported by a lower, overall employee \\n \\n Page 5 of 22 \\n count, which fell sequentially by another fourteen hundred, or 1%, to below 132,000.  The total staff count is \\ndown 25 thousand, or 16%, from our 2022 baseline.  \\nOur underlying cost -income ratio dropped by two points sequentially to 78.5% and has improved by over 10 \\npoints compared to the same quarter last year.  This performance highlights the substantial progress to date \\nand outlines the path forward to reach our target ratio of under 70% by the end of 2026.  \\nAs in prior years, we expect in 4Q a modest sequential uptick in our operating expenses for select non- personnel \\nitems, including the UK bank levy and regional marketing spend.  \\nSlide 8 – Achieved >50% of gross cost save ambition  \\nMoving on to slide 8.  In the third quarter, we achieved 750 million in additional , annualized gross cost saves, \\nputting us past the halfway mark towards our 13 billion goal.  \\nAs expected, the pace of saves moderately slowed this quarter as we continued the intensive work necessary \\nto effectively dismantle the infrastructure of a former G -SIB. In particular, we completed preparation of the \\nclient account and platform migrations in our Asian wealth franchise and continued readiness efforts relating \\nto our Swiss booking center - by far our largest - that are planned for next year.  This phase of the integration \\nrequires fully staffed teams across regions to minimize client disruptio n and maintain operational efficiency.  \\nThe comparatively smaller saves this quarter are a reflection of these concerted efforts along with higher variable \\ncompensation, FX headwinds and more moderate cost progress in NCL after a year of very strong sequential \\nachievements.  \\nAs we continue our client account and platform migration work across our divisions and regions in the months ahead, we estimate sequential cost saves to be similarly sized.  We expect the pace to pick- up again once this \\ncritical integration phase is complete and we can then fully benefit from decommissioning software, hardware \\nand data centers, and by unlocking further staff capacity.  \\nBy the end of this year, we plan to have delivered around 7.5 billion in annualized gross cost saves versus our \\n2022 baseline and cumulative integration- related expenses of around 9 billion.   \\nSlide 9 – Strong capital position supporting growth and capital return ambitions  \\nNow to Slide 9, where I unpack our capital position.  We ended the third quarter with a CET1 capital ratio of \\n14.3%, slightly above our guidance of around 14%.  \\nAs Sergio highlighted, the sequential decrease this quarter results from our decision to accelerate the phase -\\nout of the PPA -related transitional capital adjustment, which led to a 65 -basis point reduction in our CET1 \\ncapital ratio.  Without this voluntary acceleration, the ratio at the end of the quarter would have been 14.9%.  \\nAs many of you will remember from last year, the acquisition accounting standard required us to fair value all \\nof Credit Suisse’s assets and liabilities at closing.  This purchase price allocation process also resulted in fair value \\ndiscounts applied to select Credit Suisse positions, such as fixed -rate Swiss mortgages and certain term note \\nliabilities, which were driven solely by interest -rate and own credit effects.  \\nAccordingly, these fair value adjustments, totaling to negative 5 billion net of tax effects, were expected to fully \\nreverse into income, or pull -to-par, over time.  Given the temporary nature of these adjustments, we agreed \\n \\n Page 6 of 22 \\n with our regulator at closing to amortize the resulting capital reduction on a linear basis over a 4- year period.  \\nThis shielded our capital from significant accounting -driven volatility, at least during the first phase of the \\nintegration process.  \\nOur decision this quarter to accelerate the phase -out of the residual balance of 3.4 billion reflects the significant \\nprogress we’ve made to date across our integration agenda, including the successful merger of the two parent \\nbanks last quarter.  This decision also underscores our confidence moving forward.   \\nMoreover, by accelerating the phase- out of the transitional capital adjustment on the aforementioned positions, \\nthe remaining PPA discount, like all other pull -to-par revenues, will now fully accrete into our capital in future \\nperiods, reversing the impact seen in this quarter’s results.   \\nSpecifically, we expect to recognize total pull -to-par revenues of 6.4  billion over the next several years, \\nbenefitting our net profit, equity, and CET1 capital.  Within this, 80% is set to accrete back by the end of 2028, \\nof which 3 and a half billion by the end of 2026.  \\nNotably, the requirement to fair value the positions subject to the transitional capital adjustment had no bearing on the Credit Suisse parent bank or its standalone capital position.  Hence,  it’s important to emphasize that our \\ndecision this quarter is equally neutral to the regulatory capital position of UBS AG, now that the two parent \\nbanks have merged.  We expect UBS AG’s standalone, fully- applied CET1 capital ratio to be a strong 13.3% \\nwhen we publish our report next week.  \\nA brief update on Basel 3 finalization as we continue to assess the effects of the Swiss implementation on January 1st.  While we’ll present the final details with our 4Q results in February, our latest estimate is that the \\nRWA impact will be a low single digit percentage of total Group RWA.  This is revised down from our prior \\nguidance of around 5%, and is now expected to reduce our CET1 capital ratio by around 30 basis points upon \\nimplementation next year.  \\nSlide 10 – Balance sheet for all seasons  \\nNow, moving on to Slide 10.  While our strong capital position is a key pillar of our strategy, starting this quarter \\nI offer a more comprehensive picture of our balance sheet and the structural drivers that contribute to making it a balance sheet for all seasons.  \\nAs of the end of the third quarter our balance sheet consisted of 1.6 trillion in total assets, with around 40% \\nin loan balances.  While we continue to optimize the risk profile of exposures inherited with the acquisition of \\nCredit Suisse, our lending book continues to reflect high credit quality and disciplined risk management.  More than 80% of our loan portfolio consists of mortgages, with an average LTV of around 50%, and fully \\ncollateralized Lombard loans.  This quarter our credit- impaired exposure as a percentage of our loan book was \\njust 73 basis points, and our cost of risk was only 8 basis points.  \\nAssets held at fair value were 494  billion, or around 30% of the total balance sheet.  Notably, Level 3 assets \\nwere 16  billion and accounted for less than 1% of our total assets.   \\nTurning to the liability side.  Our operations this quarter were funded with 776 billion of deposits and almost \\n370 billion of well -diversified wholesale funding, spread across currencies and tenors.  Our loan- to-deposit ratio \\nat quarter end was 79%. Throughout the year, w e have diligently executed on our funding plan, already having \\ncompleted our issuances for 2024 and prefunded some of our 2025 AT1 build.  \\n \\n Page 7 of 22 \\n Finally, tangible equity in the quarter increased by 3.6 billion to 80 billion, mainly driven by quarterly net profits \\nand other comprehensive income of 2.5 billion.  This was partly offset by a net reduction of 0.5  billion for \\nTreasury shares repurchased as part of our share buyback program.  Our tangible book value was 25 dollars and \\n10 cents per share, reflecting a sequential increase of 5%.  \\nOverall, we continue to operate with a highly fortified and resilient balance sheet with total loss absorbing \\ncapacity of 195 billion, a net stable funding ratio of 127% and an LCR of 199%.   \\nSlide 11 – Global Wealth Management  \\nMoving to our business divisions, starting with Global Wealth Management on slide 11.  \\nGWM’s pre -tax profit was 1.3  billion, an increase of 30% with strong positive jaws as revenue growth outpaced \\nexpenses by 4 percentage points.  \\nOur performance is showcasing the enduring competitive strengths of our wealth franchise.  Enhanced by the \\nCredit Suisse acquisition, our global scale, diversified model, and cross -divisional capabilities uniquely position \\nus to capture wallet and seize growth opportunities.  The industry trends we see accelerating include legacy and \\nlongevity -based planning needs, geographic wealth migration, and active management among the world’s \\nwealthiest investors to diversify portfolios and manage risks. These secular growth dynamics play right to our strengths.  \\nThis quarter, within an active market environment characterized by higher volatility and continuing concerns around geopolitical developments, our clients benefitted from our CIO’s call to remain invested and to position their portfolios to take advantage of the current market backdrop.  This further strengthened our clients’ trust \\nin our advice and capabilities, and contributed to strong revenue growth in every region.  \\nAll regions delivered double -digit PBT growth.  Notably, APAC delivered impressive results, more than doubling \\nlast year’s pre -tax profits on a revenue improvement of 13%. Also in the Americas, where invested assets \\nsurpassed the 2  trillion mark, our performance showed notable progress.  PBT grew by 11% year -on-year and \\nby over 30% sequentially, translating into a pre -tax margin of 12%.  \\nIn the quarter we delivered 25 billion in net new assets with positive flows across all regions.  With net new \\nassets of nearly 80 billion year -to-date, we remain on track to deliver on our 100 billion NNA ambition for 2024.   \\nOnce again, we attracted strong net new assets while continuing to absorb integration- related headwinds, \\nincluding the anticipated roll -off of a portion of the fixed term deposits associated with last year’s win -back \\ncampaign, our ongoing work to optimize balance sheet usage and enhance revenue margins, and the residual tail of client advisors leaving the Credit Suisse platform.  \\nOf the 60 billion in deposit volumes maturing in the quarter, we retained 85% on our platform, including converting 20% into more profitable mandates, structured products and other liquidity solutions. Managing this roll -off will remain a short- term priority for us as we expect elevated maturing deposit volumes over the  \\nnext two quarters.  \\nAdditionally, by remaining focused on improving the efficiency of our financial resources and increasing \\nprofitability on sub -hurdle relationships, our balance sheet optimization efforts have supported incremental \\nprogress in our revenue over RWA margin, b ringing it to over 23%, a 3 percentage point increase from a year \\nago when we started this work.  \\n \\n Page 8 of 22 \\n Net new fee- generating assets were 15  billion, reflecting strong discretionary mandate sales in all regions with \\ndisciplined pricing supporting stable margins sequentially.  \\nNow, onto GWM’s financials.  \\nTotal revenues increased by 7% with higher recurring net fee income and double- digit growth in transactional \\nrevenues, more than offsetting NII headwinds.  As I’ve highlighted in the past, a lower interest rate environment \\nis expected to spur client demand for more advisory solutions, including structured products and alternative \\ninvestments, as clients seek to rebalance their cash exposures in search for yie ld. We also expect clients to re -\\nengage in lending activities helping to offset some of the NII headw inds. \\nRecurring net fee income increased by 9% to 3.2 billion as our invested assets grew to 4.3  trillion, up 16% \\nyear-on-year and 5% sequentially, driven by market growth, FX and net new asset inflows.  Mandate \\npenetration increased to 38%, up 2 points from the same quarter a year ago, reflecting the value our clients \\nsee in our advice and solutions supporting their investment objectives.  \\nTransaction -based revenues were 1.1  billion, up 19%, with strong momentum across all regions supported by \\nthe initial reduction in US policy rates.  Combined with the announcement of economic stimulus in China, this \\nmade for a constructive trading environment  for our clients.   \\nIn addition, t he successful collaboration between GWM and the IB, and our investments in AI -led sales support \\ncapabilities, allowed us to capture transactional volumes across our expanding product shelf.  We saw impressive \\ngrowth in structured and cash products, and in alternatives.  This continues to be especially notable in APAC \\nand the Americas, where transactional revenues were up 25% and 23% year -on-year, respectively, and both \\nup sequentially vs a strong 2Q.  We see this momentum continuing into the four th quarter, while noting \\ntransactional activity typically decreases as we approach year -end. \\nNet interest income at 1.6 billion was broadly flat sequentially as reinvestment income from longer duration in \\nour replication portfolios offset expected headwinds from mix shifts.  \\nIn the fourth quarter, with 50 basis points of further US dollar rate cuts priced -in, we expect a sequential mid -\\nsingle digit percentage drop in NII.  This is expected to be driven mainly by headwinds to deposit revenues from \\nlower rates, while our deposit balances, as mentioned, reflect conversion of fixed -term deposits, in part, into \\nnon-deposit solutions.   \\nAlso, as mentioned last quarter, towards the end of the year, we plan to adjust the sweep deposit rates in our \\nUS advisory accounts.  The effect of this change on our NII is expected to be minimal in the fourth quarter. \\nMoreover, lower US dollar rate assumptions also reduce the modeled impact of sweep deposit rate changes on net interest income in 2025, and likewise would be expected to improve  last quarter’s guidance of negative \\n50 million of PBT  annually . \\nAcross GWM, as mentioned last quarter, we continue to initially expect net interest income to trough around the middle of next year based on current implied forwards. With our 4Q results, and after completing our \\nplanning process, we intend to offer more developed insight into our 2025 expectations for GWM NII.  \\nOperating expenses increased by 3% compared to last year and 1% sequentially.  Excluding compensation-\\nrelated and currency translation effects, underlying operating expenses dropped by 4% compared to the second \\nquarter.  As highlighted previously, the ongoing client account and platform migration work is expected to be \\na significant driver of cost reductions in GWM by the middle  of 2025 and into 2026.  \\n \\n Page 9 of 22 \\n Slide 12 – Personal & Corporate Banking (CHF)  \\nTurning to Personal and Corporate Banking on slide 12.  \\nP&C delivered third quarter pre -tax profit of 659  million Swiss francs, down 7%.  Revenues decreased by a \\nsimilar level, mainly as NII dropped by 11% as the prior -year quarter featured substantially higher Swiss franc \\ninterest rates.  Recurring net fee income increased by 5% on higher custody assets, while transaction- based \\nrevenues were down 5% mainly from lower corporate activity, including in trade finance, partly offset by higher \\ncard fees.  \\nNII decreased by 2% sequentially, mainly driven by the effect of the SNB’s second 25 basis point interest rate \\ncut in June and partly offset by the benefits of our balance sheet optimization efforts, which remain key to \\nbuilding back returns to pre -acquisition levels.  \\nThis work, which continues to contribute to improved revenues on capital deployed and fixing the funding gap inherited from Credit Suisse, came at the expense of net new lending outflows of 5.6 billion Swiss francs this \\nquarter.  I would highlight that P&C’s contribution to our commitment in Switzerland to maintain a loan book \\nof 350 billion Swiss francs was evidenced by around 25 billion in loans granted or renewed during the quarter.  \\nIn the fourth quarter, we expect NII to tick down sequentially by a low single -digit percentage both in Swiss \\nfrancs and US dollars as the effects of the SNB’s third 25 basis- point rate cut in September are expected to \\nmore than offset improved lending revenues from our re -pricing efforts and lower funding costs.  Considering \\ncompetitive dynamics in Switzerland as well as the measured pace of accommodation in the Swiss central bank’s monetary policy, our objective is to protect client deposit balances.  Hence , our guidance for the fourth quarter \\nreflects only a slight increase in deposit beta.  \\nAs mentioned last quarter, with Swiss franc interest rates stabilizing by mid next year based on current implied forwards, we continue to expect net interest income in P&C to trough shortly thereafter. We will offer additional \\ninsights into our 2025 expect ations for P&C NII next quarter.  \\nCredit loss expense was 71  million, driven by several positions in our corporate loan book, mainly on the Credit \\nSuisse platform.  For the foreseeable future, we expect CLE to remain at broadly similar levels given the persistent \\nrelative strength of the Swiss franc and some economic softness in the main Swiss export markets, contributing \\nto an already muted domestic economic outlook.  \\nOperating expenses in P&C were broadly flat year -on-year and down 1% quarter -on-quarter.  \\nSlide 13 – Asset Management \\nOn slide 13, pre -tax profit in Asset Management increased by 46% to 237  million with revenues up 13%.  Our \\nasset management franchise is making visible progress in advancing its strategy of offering differentiated and tailored client solutions at scale.  Complementing this is a high level of focus on streamlining the operational \\nbackbone of the division as well as exiting non- strategic businesses.  \\nResults in the quarter include gains of 72 million from disposals, largely related to the residual portion of the \\nsale of our Brazilian real estate fund management business. Excluding these gains, Asset Management’s \\nrevenues were up by 3% year -on-year. \\n \\n Page 10 of 22 \\n Net management fees were broadly flat as higher average invested assets and the effect of a revaluation of a \\nreal estate fund offset ongoing margin compression from clients rotating into lower -margin products.  \\nPerformance fees were 46  million compared to 18 million in the prior year quarter driven by higher revenues in \\nour hedge fund businesses and Fixed Income.  \\nNet new money in the quarter was positive 2  billion, with strong inflows in Money Markets and positive \\ncontribution from our China JVs, more than offsetting outflows in Equities.   \\nOperating expenses were 4% higher as cost reductions from lower headcount were more than offset by higher personnel and litigation expenses.  \\nSlide 14 – Investment Bank  \\nOn to our Investment Bank’s performance on slide 14.  \\nThe IB continued to build revenue momentum leveraging the investments in teams and capabilities acquired \\nwith Credit Suisse and delivered another strong set of results with pre- tax profit of 377 million in the quarter.  \\nRevenues increased by 29% to 2.5 billion with Global Markets posting its best third quarter on record and \\nsupported by solid performance in Global Banking.   \\nBanking revenues increased by 21% to 555 million as we leveraged the increased breadth of our franchise and \\nsolidified growth achieved over the last several quarters . Our investments in talent and integrated coverage \\nteams are paying off as we have gained meaningful market share in a number of key sectors.  \\nRegionally, APAC delivered its best third quarter on record in M&A, more than doubling total revenues from the prior year quarter, while Banking revenues in the US were up by around 20%.  \\nIn Advisory we delivered top line growth of 13% and further market share gains in M&A.  Capital Markets \\nrevenues rose by 28% with increases across all product groups.   \\nLooking ahead, we remain encouraged by the strength of our pipeline, which should support our performance \\ninto 2025.  We also maintain a top -ten ranking across the street in announced M&A volume.   \\nRevenues in Markets increased by 31% to 1.9 billion,  driven by client activity and the strength of our expanded \\nfranchise.  We saw increases across all regions, and notably in the Americas, where revenues were up by around \\n60%.   \\nEquities revenues were up by 33%, supported by higher constructive volatility.  Our Equity Derivatives and Cash \\nEquities businesses each delivered their best third quarter on record.  \\nFRC was up by 26% with double -digit growth in FX and rates, as we benefitted from increased client activity, \\nalbeit against a softer comparative quarter a year ago.   \\nOperating expenses rose by 2%, and were broadly flat excluding currency effects.   \\n \\n \\n Page 11 of 22 \\n Slide 15 – Non- core and Legacy  \\nMoving to Slide 15.  \\nNon- core and Legacy’s pre -tax loss in the quarter was 333  million, with 262 million in revenues, primarily from \\nposition exit gains in securitized products partly offset by net losses in macro.   \\nExcluding litigation, operating expenses were down by over 40% year -on-year, and up 1% sequentially.   \\nIn the fourth quarter, we expect NCL to generate a pre -tax loss broadly in line with the guidance we provided \\nwith our 2Q24 earnings.  \\nSlide 16 – Non- core and Legacy run- down ahead of schedule  \\nNow onto Slide 16.  In the quarter NCL reduced RWA and LRD by 5 and 11 billion, respectively.  Since the second \\nquarter last year, NCL has freed up almost 6  billion of capital by reducing its RWA by around half and its LRD \\nby two thirds.  It also halved its cost base in that time.  \\nThis progress to -date puts us nearly a year ahead of our de -risking schedule, including closing over 50% of the \\n14 thousand books we started with.  By the end of 2026 we aim to have less than 5% remaining.  \\nAs the chart illustrates, solely by letting the portfolio naturally run -off, we would already broadly meet our \\ncurrent ambition to reduce NCL to 5% of Group RWA by 2026.   \\nThis impressive result is testament to the skillful work delivered by the NCL team over the past 5 quarters.  After \\ncompleting our planning process, we’ll provide an update to our NCL ambitions through 2026 with our fourth \\nquarter results in February.  \\nRecapping the quarter, we showcased the strengths and long- term strategic advantages of our franchise by \\nbuilding on positive client momentum and delivering strong underlying profitability.  We continued to make impressive progress in integrating Credit Suisse as we’ve successfully embarked on the \\nnext critical phase of our integration journey.  \\nWith a strong capital and liquidity position, and a balance sheet for all seasons, we remain well positioned to \\ncontinue delivering for our clients and generating attractive shareholder returns while investing for our future.  \\nWith that, let’s open for questions.  \\n \\n Page 12 of 22 \\n Analyst Q&A (CEO and CFO)  \\nKian Abouhossein, JP Morgan  \\nYes, thanks  for taking  my questions. The  first question  is on buyback in 2025.  The second  quarter stage, you  \\nwere not commenting yet on buyback. Clearly, that changed at a recent conference and reconfirming this , \\nSergio , today as well. I just wanted to understand what the thinking is in terms of changing the buyback  \\nview in 2025 and how that  fits into the regulatory regime changes that might  come  in the future. And  in \\nthat context,  if you could just also indicate  if you will make any comments with the  full-year results, as you \\nwill give us a buyback for 2025, how  that fits with regulatory changes, especially I’m referring to the parent \\nbank capital issue? \\nAnd then the second question is on US wealth management. Are you seeing a peak in yield- seeking from \\ndepositors  at this point?  And we're  hearing  from US  peers  that there  are some  stabilization  in sweep  \\naccounts. So I'm just trying  to understand how  lower rates will impact sweep, but also potentially  impact  \\nloan growth,  as I can see  it's flattish in the quarter.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nOkay.  Thanks, Kian.  Well,  look,  if I – if you  go back into our remarks,  my remarks , in the past, I always  \\nclearly  stated  that starting a buyback program in  2024 would be at the start of a  journey  that would not be \\na stop-and-go kind of strategy. So I always , and we always , flagged the fact that in 2025 we would have a \\nshare buyback. Now we are reiterating that guidance by saying that we do expect in the early part of  2025, \\nas we present Q4 results, to tell , like we did this year, the amount of ambitions or the size of  the ambitions \\nwe have for 2025. So in that  sense , I think that's – I just – we are just reiterating our commitments , also in \\nrespect of our ambitions for 2026 is that , of course, they are subject to requirements – potential new \\nrequirements in Switzerland , and then we will assess. But our ambition is to have similar returns we had \\nbefore the acquisition by 2026.  \\nNow for 2025, early 2025, your question, are we going to have  more clarity? I don't know. We are not \\nreally in control of the  timing.  I think , I suspect,  that we  won't be  able give a lot of guidance  on that – in \\nthat sense, because, as you know, we are still going  through technical discussions. The consultation process \\nprobably is gonna  start late this year or even in the early part of next year and is gonna  to take a few– few \\nmonths , so it's very unlikely that in February we will be able to give much more clarity on this topic. And so \\nthis is very unlikely then to affect 2025 capital returns ambitions.  \\nAnd, you know, that also implies that there is no change in terms of the parent bank. As you saw, our \\nparent bank, our  overall  capital position it's very strong. And  also, when  you look at our parent bank capital  \\nat 13.3%  is very solid , is already on a fully applied basis and with a  methodology on how  we look at \\nvaluation of assets and subsidiaries , that is quite conservative definitely  compared to what we saw in the \\npast. \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nHi, Kian. Regarding  your second question,  in terms of lower rates and impact  on our US wealth  business.  So \\nfirst on the loan side, absolutely I would expect across the division that lower rates will  – and I made this \\ncomment earlier in  my remarks – you know , should spur additional lending opportunities across the \\ndivision, including  in the US. On the deposit side,  in particular on sweeps , so first  I'd say a couple of things , \\nthat we are seeing sweep deposits  continue  to taper.  But in the quarter, we  did have smaller  outflows, so \\nstill about a billion  of outflows. You know , I'd say that some of the  market  dynamics  that I  see in this \\n \\n Page 13 of 22 \\n regard, you know, one is  that we're not yet pricing sweeps higher versus maybe some of the peer set are  \\ndoing.  \\nSecondly, you know, we have a higher percentage of assets with ultra -high net worth. And for sure, that \\nasset band tends to have a  much  lower percentage of A uM in sweeps. So that's going to  be a market \\ndynamic for us that will always weigh on,  you know , that, that sensitivity , just given that with a more high \\nnet worth client base where  there's more  sensitivity  in terms of deposit pricing, you know, naturally  then \\nthere'll  be lower  balances  and sweeps. That said, you know, I expect as rates come down that we will see – \\nwe will continue to see sweeps balance taper, if not starting to grow.  \\nKian Abouhossein, JP Morgan  \\nThank you. \\n \\nChris Hallam, Goldman Sachs  \\nYes, so  good morning,  everybody. Just  two questions  from me. So 2025 profitability, you've  guided  for high \\nsingle -digit return on core tier 1. Consensus is at 9 %. You're already at 9.2 % in the nine -month stage this \\nyear. So how should we be thinking about the outlook  for returns and earnings growth in ‘ 25 versus ‘ 24? \\nAnd also, any specific items to be aware of in the fourth quarter that could bring the ‘ 24 return on core tier \\n1 down meaningfully from what we've seen so far this year?  \\nAnd then second , and again, it's  a bit of a  follow  up on US wealth. So  12%  pre-tax margin  in the quarter,  \\nare there any one -offs in that number? And you've highlighted before your desire to bring , you know , a \\nbroader suite of products and capabilities to clients to drive that margin  up towards the mid- teens target. \\nWhat are the key signposts we should look out  for you to sort of be delivering on that  strategy? And given \\nthe comments yesterday from Colm  on M&A, how does M&A fit  into that strategy as well? Thank you.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nYeah. Hi, Chris. So maybe just address your second question initially. Just in terms of the pre -tax profit in the \\nAmericas region. No, no one -offs. Just,  you know, I would comment that , first of  all, strongest revenue \\nquarter ever. So there, you know, certainly seeing that as a strength. You know, we continue to see revenues \\ngrowing nicely, up 3% sequentially in the region and 9% year -on-year and so , no one -offs. You see as well , I \\nhighlighted in my comments the transaction revenues continue to be  a real plus  for us, you know , as we \\nborrow ed a page from our strategy outside the US in terms of working hand in hand with the IB and working \\nwith clients and bringing them our product shelf in transactions . So really generating good transactional  \\ngrowth in that respect.  \\nLook, we're going to – we know what  we need to do and we're going to stay focused on continuing to , \\nyou know , chip away at our goals.  It's not going to happen over night and we'll continue to come back and \\ntalk about , you know  – in fact in the fourth quarter,  we'll give more of  a perspective on how we see things \\nand the signposts you can  look to. In terms of 2025 and, you know , I'd say, you know , first off,  you know , if \\nyou look out  into 4Q, you asked, I mean, other than the, you know, the seasonality that we highlighted in \\nthe fourth quarter , a bit on the top line that you would normally  see, despite the  momentum we saw  \\ncoming  into 4Q. Also, a  little bit  on the expense side,  as I highlighted in my comments, a bit of the, you \\nknow, somewhat seasonal uptick and some one -offs like the UK bank levy.  But away from that,  no, I mean,  \\nnothing that we're  seeing , and nothing on the CET1  capital ratio  that I would  – that I would highlight. You \\n \\n Page 14 of 22 \\n know, as we look out, you know, I don't think we want – we don't think it's appropriate to draw a straight \\nline or extrapolate from the strong return on CET1 we've generated this year. I think we just have to keep \\ndoing the things that  we said we're going to do. We know we have costs that  have to continue to come \\nout at  this point.  That's  going to be the biggest driver  of getting  us to a cost-income  ratio below  70%  and \\nreturns to around 15% by the end of 2026.  We know that's the ambition for us and we're going to work \\nover the next two years to get there. But, you know, at this point, I wouldn't extrapolate necessarily from \\nour ’24 performance to draw a line into ‘ 25. \\nChris  Hallam, Goldman Sachs  \\nOkay.  Thanks  very much .  \\n \\nGiulia  Miotto, Morgan Stanley  \\nYes, hi. Good morning. So two questions f rom me. Todd, you mentioned some balance sheet optimization \\nefforts that have  lifted  revenues  over RWAs b y 3 percentage  points. I  was wondering if you  could  shed some  \\nlight on, you know , these measures and how much is  left to come? I  think in Q4, you highlighted some NII  \\n[Edit: NNA]  impac t, and I was wondering how  much of that has  already  come through?  \\nAnd then aside  from the quarter,  and going back  to the US wealth business, in my understanding, once you \\nget to 15% PBT and once you have done with the CS integration, you could consider some inorganic growth \\nopportunity to further improve margins.  But isn't this at odds  with the Too Big to Fail proposal the  way it is \\nwritten  at the moment, which  sort of penalizes growth in foreign subsidiaries? And how do you square  the \\ntwo? Thank you.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nHi, Giulia.  Yeah, so  on the balance  sheet optimization,  yeah, thanks. Thanks  for recalling  that point  in my \\nremarks,  was, that is something  we're , you know , quite  proud of, that work  which  is driving up the, you  \\nknow, the  efficiency  on the capital deployed in the businesses that we inherited. And so this has been a big \\npiece of work that's been driven by the business – really across the entire business. And so the impact is \\nappreciable as you saw. So just some insight into it , so – and I've talked about this a bit  before, but \\neffectively, you know, when we look at the capital deployed typically around lending relationships that ha d \\nbeen largely inherited  – albeit we can look at still, you know, the ones that are more heritage UBS as well, \\nyou know, to the extent that they're sub- hurdle  – we've  been  taking  the steps to drive additional revenues, \\nyou know, through repricing  efforts, but  importantly,  to expand the product shelf and offering available to \\nthose clients who might be monoline clients.  And so that's been a big effort and you could see that in the \\nuptick in the revenue over RWA as we expand effectively the offering to those clients who may have just \\nbeen clients who were, you know, had a loan with us , with Credit Suisse , and now have a much broader \\narray. And so, you know, it's a win- win as we bring a lot of value.  I mentioned the impact on  net new assets \\nbecause naturally,  as you attempt to  optimize  the balance  sheet, while we've  been  successful,  there  will be \\ntimes when  you try to reprice  that, you know, there  will be  clients , and in particular securities,  leaving the \\nplatform. And so that's where the N NA headwind is that I talked about that we're capturing in our \\notherwise impressive net new asset performance in the quarter.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nYeah. Giulia, on the second question, I think that first of all, I think  it would be premature to draw a \\n \\n Page 15 of 22 \\n conclusion around what the  new regulation  will be. Having  said that, you have to balance  that, you know, \\none aspect that  has been clearly outlined by the Swiss Federal Council proposal is that their intention , or \\ntheir desire , to keep Switzerland , and broadly speaking , also UBS , as a competitive global player. So I can't \\nreally see how this is possible with the,  you know, with a regime  that would penalize expansion globally.  So \\nin that  sense, I think  it's, we – as we mentioned before, we do believe that whatever the new regime will \\nbe, it will be something that fits into this strategic direction outlined by the Federal Council , and a desire to \\ncorrect some aspect of the current regulation,  which  broadly  speaking, is  a very strong  regulation, one  of \\nthe most demanding  ones when  fully applied and consistently applied.  That was  not the case in the Credit \\nSuisse situation. UBS  is a completely  different situation.  We believe we have a very strong capital position, a \\nbalance sheet for all season s, and we are able to sustain both a global business model, but  also staying  very \\nclose  to our own markets and sustain  the economy.  So, you know, when we  have all the facts, we will draw \\nstrategic conclusions on what to do. It's now premature to do that.  \\nGiulia Miotto, Morgan Stanley  \\nThank you. \\n \\nStefan Stalmann, Autonomous  \\nHi, good morning and thank you  very much  for taking  my questions. The  first one  I wanted to ask is , I \\nnoticed that your sensitivity to a downward shift of the yield curve has actually come down a lot. In the \\nsecond quarter, you guided for minus 1.5 billion. Now it's only 300 million, and that is despite the fact that \\nthe rate environment hasn't changed dramatically during the third quarter. Could you maybe explain what has changed then?  \\nAnd another question not directly related to the results, but there were stories that you might be interested \\nin some kind of joint venture in India, potentially with a player called 36 0 ONE. You may not be able to \\ncomment on this specifically, but hypothetically, would this be indicative  of any  strategic  desire  to shift more  \\nonshore  and more  into potentially lower wealth brackets if you contemplate such a move? Thank you very \\nmuch.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nHey, Stefan. How are you? On the first  – yeah, good spot. So the – that asymmetry  is a function of now , in \\nthe lower interest rate environment in  Swiss franc terms, it's just the loan  flooring dynamics that come  into \\nplay from negative  interest rates. So  you see that the  down  100 basis points  scenario  will have  a much  more  \\nlimited  impact , or an asymmetrical impact to the up 100 basis point impact,  in particular in Swissy.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nYeah. And  on the second question, you're  right, we  are not going to comment on  any speculations  or \\nrumors,  but, you know, we do believe  that Asia-PAC is a growth business.  We have now a stronger presence \\nin India thanks  to the combination of the UBS and Credit Suisse capabilities. We always look at ways to \\nenhance our businesses in each key locations  where we operate, but I wouldn't draw  a conclusion that we \\nare thinking about major  strategic moves in terms of segment focus at this stage.  \\n \\n Page 16 of 22 \\n Stefan Stalmann, Autonomous  \\nOkay.  Thank you very much.  Thank you. \\n \\nJeremy Sigee, BNP Paribas  \\nMorning. Thank you. Just a couple of follow ups on wealth management actually and they ’re both  things \\nthat you've touched on, but  I just want to get into a bit more detail.  The first one was on advis or numbers, \\nwhich are coming down a  little bit more, sort of as expected  in this quarter.  But I just wondered where  you \\nare in that process and what the outlook is for , you know , how much more reduction in advis or numbers do \\nyou expect? And is there a point  at which that returns to growth  mode , or does it stay in optimization  mode  \\nfor a continued period of time? So , advis or numbers.  \\nAnd then the second question was just to  talk a bit more  about Asia  in wealth  management.  You referred  to \\nthe stimulus, you referred to the pickup in transaction activity , so I just wondered where you think we are in \\nthat process?  And for example,  whether  you're  seeing  signs  of re-leveraging  and just how  much  improvement \\nyou see ahead of us in that Asia process?  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nHi, Jeremy. Yeah. So first on Asia. Yeah, we're really pleased with the performance in GWM  APAC and \\nthanks for recognizing  that as  well. You know, you  see the sequential  progress,  this, you know, having \\ntransaction -based income up in 3Q versus 2Q , really proud of that result. And then you see the year -on-\\nyear quite strong. You know, in terms  of where we are, I think, you know, this  –  we have , I would argue  \\nwe have a long road ahead in the sense of good upside, just given that, you know, the business  is first \\ncoming together now on the same platform. I mean, we shouldn't underestimate the importance of that. \\nYou know, with the Hong Kong client  account  migration  just having  been  completed  this past weekend , \\nand we're  looking  forward  to Singapore  and Japan in the fourth quarter.  \\nI mean, these are things that are really going to  just further bring the business together. And, you know, I \\nthink from here, lower rates, you know, let's see , but re-leveraging  opportunity, as you mentioned,  the \\nbusiness is very focused. I  think  the business  is, you  know, is  positioning itself to  fire on all cylinders  in \\nAPAC.  And I'm very, very bullish about that. So in terms of where we are in the process, I think, you know, \\nobviously it's been a good backdrop in this last quarter, but I think there are really good things ahead.  \\nIn terms of the advisor numbers, I would sort of, you know, look at that in two ways.  First, you know, on \\nthe non- US or what we call the Swiss and I nternational  part of GWM, you know, I would say from an \\nadvisor perspective, it is still – optimization’ s probably the word – to come together. I think, you know, it's – \\nlion's  share  of that's been  complete.  You know , I've talked  about the  Credit S uisse client  advisors leaving  for \\nsome period of time , and that's been an old story , and it's just really the ta il of it that we talk about maybe \\nas a headwind  a bit, on net new  assets. But in  terms of the  advisor head count, you  know, I  just see  the \\nteams as they come  together as well once all the platform work  is complete,  you know, I  think  then we get \\nto a point  and that  of stability , and from there the business can make targeted investments in specific \\nregions to grow  for sure, but to already leverage at scale.  \\nI think  the US we  need  to, a bit, take a wait-and-see, and see what the  leadership  comes back with  a bit \\nand they – as they do their strategic  reviews  and we'll talk – Sergio  and I will come  out and talk a bit in the \\nfourth  quarter about that. You know, I think, you know, it has been a story of somewhat trying to get  \\n \\n Page 17 of 22 \\n more productive with a smaller advisor workforce  over a number  of years. And  we'll have to see if that's, \\nyou know, the  direction  of travel  that the current leadership wants to go.  \\nJeremy Sigee, BNP Paribas  \\nGreat.  Thank you. \\n \\nAmit Goel, Mediobanca  \\nHi. Thank you. Yeah. So two questions for me , also one on the US wealth business.  I found it really \\ninteresting, the commentary about potentially looking at acquisitions. I guess what I'm just wondering is \\nthen, you know,  from a strategy standpoint, if part  of the  issue in terms of operating margin  is the scale and \\nthe cost base  relative  to the revenues , you  know, is  it now then the case that it's cheaper  to acquire  than to \\nsimply  just hire?  Because, you know, the  US, you know, as you say, is , the focus has been on productivity, \\nreducing FA numbers. So I'm just trying to think, is that because, you know, these 400% recruitment deals \\nare now just too expensive to make it worthwhile, but it's actually just cheaper to buy  an organization?  \\nAnd then secondly,  just going back on the deposits  and the roll-off of the  fixed term deposits  within  wealth,  \\nI'm just curious , were those  kind of written  12 months  ago and,  you know, w ere those  done at , kind of , quite \\nhigh rates? So just curious if there's also potentially some of that effect into Q4 and start of next year? Thank \\nyou. \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nYeah. Hi, Amit.  Yeah. So  on the deposits  question, yeah, these were written,  you know, basically they're – \\nthey have  a year maturity  so you start to see, we start in  2Q already , ones that were  written  just in  the wake \\nof the acquisition, you know, all the way through, I would say, you know, the end of the year of 2023 into \\nthe very beginning of this year. And they had – they were competitive in terms of pricing for sure, as part \\nof, you know, stabilizing the franchise and engaging with clients. So for sure and so now as they mature, \\nyou know, the question,  and that's  what I've been highlighting in the last couple of quarters,  the question \\nbecomes, you know, what we call landing, we refer  to them as landing those deposits in the sense of \\nconverting them into other parts of the platform as we've been doing successfully.  \\nRetaining  is the key, you  know, is  the key  objective  and retaining them  in a more  profitable  manner. We're \\ndoing that quite successfully, but it's a headwind on NNA that we've absorbed,  in these NNA metrics that \\nI've been highlighting insofar as  you know, there  is still some that are leaving the  platform.  In terms of the \\noutlook  we still see elevated , I think 3Q is the peak, but we still see elevated  maturing FTDs in the fourth \\nquarter and into the front part of the first quarter before, you know, we could get this issue a bit in the \\nrearview.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nWell,  in respect, again, I  guess  on this potential  inorganic thing , you  know, I have  to say that  Colm made  it \\nvery clear that it's not a  tomorrow -morning kind of issue , so I think  it's totally premature  to speculate how – \\nif and how – we would do any such a move. Our priority right now is to improve what we do in the US, \\nbring ing the margins to, narrowing the margins to our peers  and doing  better what we  have today , and \\nthen potentially by  doing that, and we're  going to create  also the optionality  and to really  choose  what is  – \\nfits best, is it an organic  growth or is it inorganic , and what fits the best in our business model, which is \\n \\n Page 18 of 22 \\n asset gathering -centric.  \\nThe scale issue in the US  is pretty  much driven by  the fact that we have a banking platform,  a G-SIB \\nplatform  de facto  as – through the intermediate holding company – that can accommodate different \\nbanking businesses, which we don't have. So again,  I think  that, you know, once  we finish  this chapter of \\nrestoring  the profitability at the levels we want to be , and we fully extract the value of our investments in \\nthe Investment Bank and the collaboration  between  the Investment  Bank and Wealth  Management  and \\nAsset Management,  we will determine the next phase. Now, it's really way too early to speculate.  \\n \\nAnke Reingen, RBC \\nHi. Yeah, thank you very  much for taking my question. Just two small ones on capital, please. The first one is \\non the core tier 1 ratio staying , I mean  ex the accelerated amortization , stable quarter -on-quarter . And that's \\nin spite of a really strong , like, profit capital generation. I mean, I realized there are a number of things \\ngoing on, including FX, but  is there something else we should keep in mind  that only  means  the capital ratio  \\nis flat or you're  investing more  capital into organic  growth ? Otherwise, I guess given the strong earnings, the \\nexpectation will be the capital generation  drives the ratio higher.  \\nAnd then secondly,  just on  the Basel IV  impact,  just to  confirm, would that be  at the UBS AG , would the \\nimpact be around 30 basis points as well? Thank you.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nHi Anke. Yeah. So on the first – on your  first question in terms of the capital accretion, ex  the acceleration of \\ntransitional adjustment, I  think  there  are a few factors to consider.  You know, one  is the FX sensy , I mean  you \\nmentioned that, but you know we disclosed that ther e is an FX sensy  of 18 basis points on our capital with \\nrespect to a 10% depreciation in the dollar , you know,  versus our major currencies. If you look at – if you \\nlook at currencies in 3Q in particular, the Swissy  dollar  was down around 6% from the beginning of the \\nquarter until the end. And the pound versus the dollar , similar dynamic. So that accounts  for, you know, close \\nto 0.1% on the capital ratio that the currency effect s this quarter as you mentioned so that's one piece.  \\nAnother piece  is just the temporary  difference deferred tax assets, you know, given  the reduction in the \\nCET1  level of capital from the acceleration , we are at the 10% threshold. So we lose a bit, you know, goes \\nover the 10% and therefore lose  the benefit  of the  temp  difference  DTA,  which  has a modest impact. And  \\nthen third,  just slightly  increasing  the accrual for future award hedging, future share award hedges. That's in \\nour capital so that also has an impact . So those all contribute to probably why you would have  expected \\nmaybe  on net profit , other things equal , to be potentially slightly above the 15 handle.  \\nAnke Reingen, RBC \\nOk, thank you.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nSorry, on the Basel III final impact on the parent bank. It won't be the entire 30 basis points affecting the \\nparent bank but it should be most of – the most of it,  there might be some that falls outside. But again, if \\nyou're talking also the parent bank standalone, it won't be all of it because still a fair bit of activity that's \\n \\n Page 19 of 22 \\n subject to the Basel III changes , you know,  are happening in subsidiaries, not in the parent bank itself. So I \\nwould expect that there'll be some but not all of the 30 basis point impact in the parent bank itself.  \\nAnke Reingen, RBC \\nThank you very much . \\n \\nAndrew Coombs, Citi  \\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple , both related to revenues. Firstly, coming back to \\nthe US sweep deposits and repricing. Thank you  firstly  for the additional color around the slightly less than 50 \\nmillion PBT impact. But can I ask if you could possibly break out revenue gross impact versus the cost save \\noffset on that? And also, do the class action suits in the SEC probe have any implications on pricing dynamics \\nin your mind for the industry as well as for you going forward?   \\nAnd then the second question actually on loans , if you ad just out for FX , you've seen a CHF 10 billion decline \\nQ-on-Q. You reiterated this point about committing to CHF 350 billion loan book across P&C and GWM \\nSwitzerland. You're now running a bit below that , I think you’ re closer to  CHF 340 [ billion ]. So, just to be \\nclear, is the CHF 350 [ billion ] a commitment throughout this period or is it a case of you expect to trend down \\nand then recover back to that CHF 350 [billion ]? Thank you.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nHey, Andrew. So on the second one, look, it's a commitment you know to maintain around that level. So, you \\nknow, we've been doing the balance sheet work that I've been highlighting in my remarks, both in P&C and \\nGWM. And, you know, in P&C, we actually saw net new loan outflows, as I highlighted , of about \\nCHF 6 billion this quarter. This is a commitment that we've made to the market and you can look at that as \\nan ambition that w e’ll continue to focus  on and commit to. But, of course, we're also running the business so \\nthere might be volatility quarter -on-quarter  on that.  \\nIn terms of – in terms of the sweep, you were looking for some more information.  You know, I had \\nmentioned in the past that, look, the gross would be a low single -digit percentage of the divisional net \\ninterest income. So with you know, that was even based on where rates were when we gave the guidance \\nlast quarter so as rates now are coming in, you know, as mentioned, that will have a lower impact on the \\ngross as we ll as a lower impact on the net. That should give you, though, a general sense of the impact.  \\n \\nBenjamin Goy, Deutsche Bank  \\nYes. Good morning. Two questions, please, from my side. First on I nvestment Bank. You outperformed  across \\nequities and fixed income , would just be interested in a bit more color , what you attribute to between  the \\ntwo? Is it lower base , is Credit Suisse now fully at  revenue run rate or business mix? Anything else you would \\nflag?  \\nAnd then secondly, GWM and also P&C  net interest income outperformed your own guidance. Just \\nwondering why that was in your view and why the Q4 guidance could be conservative or not? So what could \\nbe worse this time? Thank you.  \\n \\n Page 20 of 22 \\n Todd Tuckner  \\nYeah. Hi, Benjamin. So on the second , in terms of, you know, our guidance last quarter, we extended \\nduration of our equity and we saw higher re investment income as I highlighted in my comments and that \\nhad, you know , a positive effect on GWM's NII. And therefore we came in flattish versus sort of a low -to-mid \\nguidance. So, that would explain that. On the P&C side, I think we saw some positive effects of the balance \\nsheet optimization work that had, you know, a strong impact in the third quarter as an offset to the rate \\nimpact as I highlighted. So those were  – there were some offsets that , which we're always working obviously \\nto drive in this lower rate s environment.  There were some offsets that had us outperform in the quarter. So I \\nmean, the guidance I gave for 4Q is how we see it at the moment, largely driven by the impact of rates. But \\nof course, we're going to always look to drive offsets where we can.  \\nIn terms of the IB, you know, I'd say, you know, the –  on the M arket s side, I mean it's effectively the you \\nknow, the Credit Suisse team ha s been embedded for some time. The positions have been all largely \\ntransitioned over. So it's you know, it's all steam and full steam ahead in terms of that.  Credit Suisse is \\nsupporting Markets on the research side but yeah, it's the performance I would say , is not about it being a \\nlower base. I think in M arkets it's been about a team that's – a strong team that's gotten stronger and you \\nsee in supportive markets how the team is performing.  \\nBenjamin Goy, Deutsche Bank  \\nThank you.  \\n \\nPiers Brown, HSBC  \\nGood morning, guys. Just got two questions. One is a follow -up on the previous investment bank question. \\nBut in terms of the global banking business, I mean, you're still showing good year -over-year momentum, but \\nmuch weaker quarter -on-quarter I think as you guided into 3Q. But could you just talk about how you're \\nthinking about execution of the pipeline, given market conditions in the fourth quarter and prospect of \\nfurther volatility?  \\nAnd then the second question is on NCL so , again, as you've guided the slowing of the pace of RWA growth, \\nyou're about just under 5 billion this quarter from 8 billion last quarter and 16 billion in the third – in the first \\nquarter.  So would it be fair to draw from that,  that the opportunities to actively run off the portfolio are fairly \\nlimited at this stage and we're really on to a natural roll off path from here? Thanks.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nYeah. Hi, Piers. So on the second look, you know, Sergio and I have said consistently that in NCL we're going \\nto prioritize cost takeout in the way we think about de -risking the book . That still is the team's focus. You \\nknow, it's had a great run and continue d to do so in 3Q with de -risking another 5 billion of RWA, you know, \\nso I mean, I wouldn't necessarily draw conclusions other than to say that the pace that they were running at \\nis a pace that would be very hard to sustain, given that we had, you know, we articulated ambitions for the \\nend of 2026 that they've been making quick wor k at. But – and we'll come back and re- guide as I mentioned \\nin my comments in 4Q about how we see the next two years.  But certainly you , you can't draw a straight line \\nfrom the performance that they've had , you know , live-to-date.  \\n \\n Page 21 of 22 \\n In terms of the B anking performance in the quarter. Look, I still think it was a good performance. It \\noutperformed the fee pool. We had a very strong first half of the year. 2Q was exceptionally strong. We had a \\nbit of bring forward as well of some deals that we were able to get done in 2Q. And probably had the inverse dynamic happening in 3Q , where we had some deals, you know, pushed into the fourth quarter and those \\ndeals on the margin can make a difference on the performance in the comparative.  \\nBut we remain very, very bullish on the pipeline. You know, naturally, of course, the uncertainties that we highlighted in our comments about 4Q, you know, are clearly potential issues to navigate, i.e., the US \\nelections, other geopolitical concerns and te nsions that may impact on banking overall. But I think, you know, \\nwe're going to continue to gain market share. And, you know, we're bullish on Banking's ability to execute \\non its pipeline.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nTodd,  I would only maybe add to that. F rom a comparison standpoint of view, it's worthwhile to note that \\nstrategically we are underweight in debt  capital market s. So, in a sense, when you look at the performance, \\nyou have to look at the third quarter was a pretty strong quarter for debt capital markets. So I think that we \\nare very happy with the developments that we've seen in B anking and the ability to win mandates. Now, of \\ncourse, we need to see if we can execute it i f the market  will – if the market  will be there, but just very, very \\nconfident that it's a good moment um. \\nSo that was the last question so thanks for dialing in and for your questions and we'll catch up in February for the Q4 results, and we're going to give you also an update on our 2025 and 2026 journey. Thank you.  \\n \\n \\n Page 22 of 22 \\n Cautionary statement regarding forward -looking statements | This document  contains statements that constitute “forward -looking statements”, \\nincluding but not limited to management’s outlook for UBS’s financial performance, statements relating to the anticipated eff ect of transactions and \\nstrategic initiatives on UBS’s business and future development and goals or intentions to achieve climate, sustainability and other social objectives. While \\nthese forward-looking statements represent UBS’s judgments, expectations and objectives concerning the matters described, a number of risks , uncertainties \\nand other important factors could cause actual developments and results to differ materially from UBS’s expectations. In part icular, the global economy may \\nbe negatively affected by shifting political circumstances, including as a result of  elections, increased tension between world powers, growing conflicts in \\nthe Middle East, as well as the continuing Russia –Ukraine war. In addition, the ongoing conflicts may continue to cause significant population displacement, \\nand lead to shortages of v ital commodities, including energy shortages and food insecurity outside the areas immediately involved in armed conflict. \\nGovernmental responses to the armed conflicts, including, with respect to the Russia –Ukraine war, coordinated successive sets of sanc tions on Russia and \\nBelarus, and Russian and Belarusian entities and nationals, and the uncertainty as to whether the ongoing conflicts will furt her widen and intensify, may \\ncontinue to have significant adverse effects on the market and macroeconomic condi tions, including in ways that cannot be anticipated. UBS’s acquisition \\nof the Credit Suisse Group has materially changed its outlook and strategic direction and introduced new operational challenges. The integration of the \\nCredit Suisse entities into the UBS structure is expected to take between three and five years and presents significant risks, including the risks that UBS Group AG may be unable to achieve the cost reductions and other benefits contemplated by the transaction. This creates signif icantly greater uncertainty \\nabout forward-looking statements. Other factors that may affect UBS’s performance and ability to achieve its plans, outlook and other objectives also include, but are not limited to: (i) the degree to which UBS is successful in the execution of its strategic plans, including its cost reduction and efficiency initiatives and its ability to manage its levels of risk -weighted assets (RWA) and leverage ratio denominator (LRD), liquidity coverage ratio and other financial \\nresources, including  changes in RWA assets and liabilities arising from higher market volatility and the size of the combined Group;

Materials and a webcast \\nreplay are available at www.ubs.com/investors   \\n \\n \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\n \\nSlide 3 – Key messages  \\nThank you, Sarah and good morning, everyone.  \\nA little over a year ago, we were asked to play a critical role in stabilizing the Swiss and global financial systems \\nthrough the acquisition of Credit Suisse and we are delivering on our commitments.  \\nThis quarter marks the return to reported net profits and capital accretion – a testament to the strength of our \\nclient franchises and significant progress on our integration plans.  \\nReported net profit was 1.8 billion, with underlying PBT of 2.6 billion and an underlying return on CET1 capital \\nof 9.6%.  \\nOur commitment to stay close to clients supported healthy revenue growth in our core businesses and flows \\nacross our asset gathering franchises. Meanwhile, we are executing on our restructuring plans at pace and \\nactively winding down Non -core and Legacy as sets.  \\nWe also achieved another 1 billion in annualized run -rate gross cost savings during the quarter as we progress \\ntowards our 13 billion target.  \\nAs for the next significant integration milestones, we remain on track with our plans to simplify our legal entity \\nstructure. The merger of our parent banks is expected by the end of May and the transition to a single U.S. \\nintermediate holding company is e xpected to occur shortly thereafter. The merger of our Swiss bank entities is \\nset to take place before the end of the third quarter. All of this is subject to final regulatory approvals.  \\nThese critical milestones will facilitate the migration of clients onto UBS platforms beginning later this year and \\nunlock the next phase of the cost, capital, funding and tax benefits from the second half of 2024, and more so \\nby the end of 2025 and into 2 026.   \\nLastly, improvement s in our CET1 capital ratio was supported by our optimization of risk weighted assets. As a \\nconsequence, we remain well positioned to deliver on our capital return targets this year.  \\n \\n Page 2 of 24 \\n Slide 4 – Strong financial performance in 1Q24 with significant operating leverage  \\nOur underlying financial performance was driven by significant positive operating leverage at the Group level \\nwith 15% revenue growth alongside a 5% reduction in operating expenses compared to the fourth quarter. \\nCompared to a year ago, we reduced operatin g expenses by around 12%.  \\nWe had excellent performance in Global Wealth Management as underlying PBT doubled sequentially to 1.3 \\nbillion. Personal & Corporate Banking delivered underlying profit growth quarter on quarter driven by higher \\nrevenues and lower credit loss expenses. Mea nwhile, Asset Management posted solid results thanks to cost \\ndiscipline.  \\nAs a result of the restructuring efforts we have undertaken over the last nine months, I am particularly pleased \\nthat Credit Suisse’s Wealth Management, Swiss Bank and Asset Management franchises are now all profitable \\nand contributed to our financial perf ormance.  \\nThe Investment Bank delivered a double -digit underlying return on attributed equity supported by lower \\noperating expenses compared to Q4, and another strong quarter in Global Banking revenues.  \\nLastly, we had a positive revenue contribution from Non -core and Legacy as we accelerated position exits while \\nfurther reducing costs.  \\nSlide 5 – Continued franchise strength and client momentum  \\nWhile we continue to deliver on the integration, helping our clients manage, grow and protect their assets \\nremains our top priority.   \\nWe maintained our momentum with clients in GWM. Invested assets have now surpassed 4 trillion  as we \\ngenerated 27 billion of net new assets.  \\nThough geopolitical volatility and macroeconomic uncertainty continued to weigh on client sentiment, we \\nobserved an improvement in risk appetite and activity.  \\nWe also saw an improvement in client activity within P&C, particularly among corporates.  \\nIn Asset Management, our clients continue to value our Separately Managed Account and Sustainability \\nofferings. We generated 21 billion in net new money during the quarter.  \\nIn Global Banking, we outperformed the fee pools in all regions, but most notably in the U.S., where the \\nintegration of Credit Suisse teams is progressing well and our pipeline continues to build.  \\nSlide 6 – Accelerated cost and balance sheet reductions in Non -core and Legacy  \\nLet’s move to Non -core and Legacy.  \\nAs I said before, and you can see on this slide, we are making good progress in taking out costs and streamlining \\nour operations as we run down the portfolio.  \\nWe accelerated the wind -down of several complex and longer -dated positions this quarter, supporting a capital \\nrelease of around 2 billion and a material improvement in our natural run -off profile.  \\n \\n Page 3 of 24 \\n We are well positioned to achieve our target to reduce NCL risk weighted assets to around 5% of the Group \\nby the end of 2026 and we remain focused on accelerating position exits in a manner that continues to optimize \\nvalue.  \\nSlide 7 – Reinforcing our balance sheet for all seasons through active management  \\nTurning to capital. As you can see, the combination of our highly capital generative business and the \\nrestructuring and active management of financial resources has further reinforced our balance sheet for all \\nseasons.  \\nThis permits us to follow through on our capital return plans for 2024. During the quarter, we began accruing \\nfor a mid -teen percentage year -on-year increase in our dividend. And, as previously communicated, we expect \\nto resume share repurchases following the completion of the parent bank merger, targeting up to 1 billion.  \\nOur ambition is to continue repurchases in 2025 and for our capital returns in 2026 to exceed pre -acquisition \\nlevels. Of course, all of this is now subject to our assessment of any proposed requirements related to \\nSwitzerland’s ongoing review of its regula tory regime.  \\nIn this respect, I ’d like to address the recent proposals in Switzerland to strengthen the too -big-to-fail regime.  \\nIt is clear both to us and several expert groups that too -low capital requirements were not why Credit Suisse \\nneeded rescuing.  \\nHowever, we agree with the Swiss Federal Council’s view that capital and liquidity requirements on their own \\nare not sufficient to ensure the resilience and stability of a systemically important bank.  \\nIn addition to having a strong capital position, it is key to maintain a sustainable business model centered around \\nrisk-adjusted profitability and a robust risk management framework. All of these are core principles for UBS.  \\nFor over ten years, this approach has served our clients, employees, investors and the Swiss economy well. It is \\nwhat allowed UBS to respond to the Swiss government’s request in March 2023 to be part of the solution s to \\nstabilize the financial system.  \\nWhile some modifications to the regulatory regime may be necessary - and we have endorsed many - the \\ndiscussion around capital should be based on facts. That includes a full and transparent account of what led to \\nthe idiosyncratic failure s of Credit Suisse.  \\nThe ultimate and crucial objective of the too -big-to-fail regime must be to credibly demonstrate that a \\nsystemically important bank could be saved in a crisis largely through its own financial resources.  \\nWe believe UBS has and will continue to demonstrate its resolvability from both an operational and capital point \\nof view. With around 200 billion in total loss absorbing capacity, our shareholders and structurally subordinated \\nbondholders bear the signific ant costs and risks to ensure taxpayers would not suffer in the highly unlikely \\nscenario that a major systemic event affects UBS.  \\nWe appreciate that many of you would like a quantification of the potential impact of any new capital regime, \\nbut it is too soon to jump to conclusions. It would be inappropriate for us to speculate or respond to speculation \\non the potential impact. We wer e not involved in the consultation process leading to the publication of the \\n \\n Page 4 of 24 \\n Federal Council’s report, and do not have clarity on any proposed changes and how they would be \\nimplemented.  \\nNonetheless, one point on which we may offer some clarification is the topic of parent bank capital. Our parent \\nbank was already well capitalized in both absolute and relative terms and is in a position today to absorb the \\nremoval of substantial regulatory  concessions granted to Credit Suisse.  \\nBy fully aligning the treatment of capital at Credit Suisse to our more rigorous approach, UBS has to provide \\nthe additional capital required for the phase -in of risk-weighted assets  for Credit Suisse participations. UBS had \\nalready done this for its subsidiaries when the rules were introduced  in 2017 . Further, UBS will not rely upon \\nthe regulatory filter historically applied to Credit Suisse. Overall, this requires additional capital in the amount \\nof about 9 billion  dollar s. \\nWhen applied consistently and coherently, the Basel 3 rules that UBS and its global peers must follow are robust. \\nThey too, are being significantly tightened. In addition, the phasing -in of progressive capital add -ons will already \\nlead to substantially hig her capital requirements for UBS’s parent bank, about another 10 billion.  \\nSo overall, we are adding almost 20 billion in additional capital which, of course, was already reflected in our \\npreviously communicated capital and financial targets.  \\nIn our view, all of this must be considered when  new requirements are discussed, defined and calibrated. In this \\nrespect, we will be constructively contributing our views to the relevant authorities and various policymakers.  \\nAs the third -largest private employer, one of the country’s largest taxpayer s and as importantly, a significant \\nprovider of credit to households and businesses in Switzerland, we believe it is  also our responsibility to share \\nour perspectives with the wider public.  \\nThis is an important discussion for the country and I remain hopeful for a proportionate outcome.  \\nIn the meantime, in addition to executing on our integration plans, we will remain focused on what we are able \\nto control – serving our clients, following through on our strategy, investing in our people and remaining a \\npillar of economic support in the co mmunities where we live and work.  \\nWith that, I  hand over to Todd.    \\n \\n Page 5 of 24 \\n Todd Tuckner  \\n \\nSlide 9 – Return to reported profitability of 1.8bn with underlying PBT 2.6bn  \\nThank you Sergio, and good morning everyone.  \\nBefore I begin, I would offer a reminder that the first quarter financial report published today includes select \\ninter-divisional changes we signaled last year. We shifted the Swiss high -net worth segment from P&C to GWM, \\nand pushed -out residual, centrally -held costs and financial resources to our business divisions, ultimately \\nincreasing the equity we allocate to them.  \\nThese divisional shifts support continued resource discipline and accountability. They also align with interests of \\nshareholders by reflecting Group performance as a whole through the reporting lens of the respective individual \\nbusinesses.  \\nIn my remarks today, I will refer to underlying numbers in US dollars and compare them to our performance \\nlast quarter, unless stated otherwise.  \\nAs illustrated on Slide 9, our financial performance this quarter reflects strength in our core businesses as well \\nas excellent progress across our integration workstreams, resulting in substantial reductions in operating \\nexpenses and risk -weighted assets.  \\nProfit before tax increased significantly to 2.6 billion from strong operating leverage quarter -on-quarter driven \\nby higher revenues and lower costs, both of which I will cover in more detail shortly.  \\nNet credit loss expenses declined by 30 million this quarter to 106 million.  \\nOn a reported basis, the first quarter net profit was 1.8 billion, including a tax expense of 0.6 billion.  The \\neffective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, lower than previously guided, primarily due to the strong \\nperformance in Non -core and Legacy that re duced the level of losses in select Credit Suisse legal entities.   \\nWe expect the effective tax rate in the second quarter to return to more elevated levels from higher forecasted \\nlosses in these entities before the first of the planned mergers takes place later this month. We then expect the \\nGroup’s effective tax rate in the second half of 2024 to continue to normalize, ultimately falling to its structural \\nlevel of 23% by 2026, driven by further legal entity optimization and cost elimination.  \\nSlide 10 – Strong underlying revenues, up 15% QoQ  \\nTotal revenues, on slide 10, increased by 15% to 12 billion with strong sequential gains in Global Wealth \\nManagement, the Investment Bank and Non -core and Legacy.  The latter included a gain from the close -out of \\nthe main aspects of the transaction relatin g to the former Credit Suisse Securitized Products business, which \\nwas announced earlier in the quarter.  \\nPartially offsetting our top line performance was a decline of 446 million in Group Items, driven primarily from \\nhedging P&L reflecting higher interest rates and widening currency basis spreads in the quarter.  \\nTotal reported revenues reached 12.7 billion, which included 0.8 billion from purchase price allocation \\nadjustments in our core businesses.  Since the Credit Suisse acquisition, these adjustments total 3.1 billion, \\nexcluding the effects in NCL, and mainly relate to loans that will pull -to-par if held to maturity.  We continue \\n \\n Page 6 of 24 \\n to expect to report additional revenues of around 7.4 billion through the end of 2028 from these acquisition -\\nrelated effects, of which 0.6 billion is expected in the second quarter.  \\nSlide 11 – Executing on cost ambitions with operating expenses down 5% QoQ  \\nMoving to slide 11. Operating expenses for the Group decreased by 5% quarter -on-quarter to 9.2 billion with \\nthe largest reductions in Non -core and Legacy, Global Wealth Management, and the Investment Bank.  \\nPersonnel costs excluding variable and Financial Advisor compensation decreased by around 120 million, or 3% \\nquarter -on-quarter.  Variable and FA compensation expenses were up 11% sequentially on the back of higher \\nrevenues. Overall, personnel expenses inc reased by 2%.  \\nThere were almost 2 thousand fewer total staff at the end of the first quarter when compared to the end of \\nthe fourth quarter of 2023, and over 19 thousand fewer versus the end of 2022, down 12.5% over the past 5 \\nquarters.  \\nNon-personnel expenses were down 0.6 billion quarter -on-quarter, driven by lower real estate expenses \\ncombined with a reduction in third party spend.  Additionally, the fourth quarter contained charges for the UK \\nbank levy and the US FDIC special assessmen t that were not present in our first quarter performance.  \\nIntegration -related expenses in the first quarter were 1 billion, split roughly half -half between personnel and \\nnon-personnel costs, resulting in reported operating expenses of 10.3 billion.   \\nSlide 12 – Cost plans on track with 50% of targeted saves expected by 2024 exit rate  \\nOn slide 12, we report on the progress against our cost ambitions as described during the investor update in \\nFebruary.  Exiting the first quarter, we realized an additional 1 billion in gross cost saves when compared to the \\n2023 exit rate.  Since the end o f 2022, we have achieved 5 billion in gross saves, or nearly 40% of our 2026 \\nexit-rate ambition of 13 billion.  \\nAs I highlighted in February, we expect our integration work to intensify over the next several, pivotal quarters.  \\nThis will require appropriate staff levels to ensure efficient, effective and well -controlled execution.   \\nAccordingly, the pace of gross cost saves is likely to decelerate from the run rate savings output achieved over \\nthe last 5 quarters, with another 1.5 billion in gross cost saves expected by the end of the year.  Following this \\nintensive phase, we continue  to expect the pace of gross saves to pick up again in 2025.  \\nIntegration -related expenses linked to our cost -saving actions reached a total of 5.5 billion since the Credit \\nSuisse acquisition, including the 1 billion incurred in the first quarter.  \\nAs previously mentioned, we expect to incur around 13 billion of integration -related expenses by the end of \\n2026, or a ratio of about 1 -to-1 between costs -to-achieve and gross saves.  As these integration charges enable \\nand unlock future cost reductions, w e expect them to outpace gross saves through the rest of 2024, totaling \\n3.5 billion, of which we estimate 1.3 billion in the second quarter.  \\nOf course, what matters is turning gross saves into clear progress in our underlying opex performance.  Our \\n1Q24 underlying operating expenses of 9.2 billion signal a significant improvement against our 2022 \\nbenchmark, meaning a majority of the gross cost saves we’ve realized to date have translated into net \\nreductions in our underlying opex.  \\n \\n Page 7 of 24 \\n Thus far, most of these life -to-date net saves benefit Non -core and Legacy.  I highlighted in February that we \\nexpect around half of the Group’s planned gross cost saves, and a considerable majority of net saves, to be \\nachieved from running down NCL’s book  as well as eliminating expenses associated with maintaining Credit \\nSuisse’s many legal entities and branches.  We are seeing this dynamic reflected in our cost performance.  We \\nalso expect NCL to benefit further from the upcoming legal entity mergers and from continued position exits, \\nworking towards a 2026 opex exit rate of less than 1 billion.   \\nFinally, in our core businesses, we expect to realize a significant portion of integration cost synergies beginning \\nin 2025 when client accounts and positions are moved to UBS platforms and applications, and Credit Suisse \\ninfrastructure is shut down.    \\nSlide 13 – Global Wealth Management  \\nMoving on to the quarterly performance of our business divisions and starting with Global Wealth Management \\non slide 13.  In the quarter, GWM’s pre -tax profit doubled to 1.3 billion on stronger revenues and lower \\noperating expenses.   \\nNotably, on a combined basis, PBT increased by around 20% year -over-year, with the Credit Suisse platform \\nreturning firmly to profitability.  \\nOverall, we see very good client momentum across GWM, with net new assets of 27 billion and strong \\ncontributions from the Americas, Switzerland, and APAC.  Net new fee generating assets reached almost 18 \\nbillion from healthy net inflows to SMAs in the US a nd discretionary mandates in EMEA and Switzerland.  \\nThe business achieved this flow performance while focusing on financial resource efficiency and balance sheet \\nmanagement, seeking to reprice loans with sub -hurdle returns or to otherwise exit such positions.  This ongoing \\nwork mitigates some of the headwinds from inherited Credit Suisse risk models and led to a decline in credit \\nand counterparty risk RWAs of 4 billion in the quarter. We’ve also begun to see progress in GWM’s revenue -\\nover-RWA metric, particularly on the Credit Suisse platform.  \\nGWM also attracted 8 billion in net new deposits in the quarter while our pricing increasingly reflects the \\nGroup’s strong liquidity profile and tighter funding spreads.  \\nI would note that we estimate seasonal tax -related outflows in our US business in the mid-to-high single -digit \\nbillions as a headwind to divisional net new asset performance in the second quarter.  \\nNow, onto GWM’s financials.  \\nRevenues increased by 10% sequentially with improvements across all lines, driven by higher client activity and \\nincreased average -asset levels. Revenue performance related to client transactional activity was particularly \\nstrong across the business.  \\nNII increased by 4% sequentially to 1.6 billion, as higher revenues from re -investments as well as increased US \\ndollar deposit rates and volumes offset the effects of tapering deposit mix shifts and client deleveraging.  \\nIn the second quarter, we expect a low -to-mid, single -digit percentage decline in GWM NII due to moderately \\nlower lending and deposit volumes, and lower interest rates in Switzerland, partly offset by additional revenues , \\nprimarily from higher US dollar rates combined with our repricing efforts.  \\n \\n Page 8 of 24 \\n For the full year 2024, we expect NII in GWM to be roughly flat versus 4Q23 annualized. Specifically, we see \\nNII and margins holding broadly steady in 2H24, and after the second quarter broadly reverses out the \\nsequential gains we realized this quarter.   \\nThis outcome, which models three US dollar rate cuts, is helped by lower funding costs as well as our balance \\nsheet initiatives.   \\nRecurring net fee income increased by 4% to 3 billion in the quarter from higher client balances and inflows in \\nnet new fee -generating assets .  This was partly offset by margin compression from more of the back book \\nreflecting greater penetration into lower margin mandates across higher wealth bands.  \\nTransaction -based income increased by a third sequentially to 1.2 billion, driven by higher trading volumes, \\nparticularly in structured products, partly due to the seasonal increase in client activity levels, with significant \\nimprovements across all region s.  Combined transaction revenues were also 9% higher year -over-year.  \\nOur APAC franchise had a particularly impressive transaction revenue quarter, doubling from 4Q with strength \\ndemonstrated across all product classes, despite the economic uncertainties weighing on sentiment for most of \\nthe first quarter.   \\nWe also saw positive momentum in the Americas, where the introduction of our international model of joint \\ncoverage of GWM clients with the IB, led to transaction -based revenue gains of 11% quarter -on-quarter and  a \\nmid-teens increase year -on-year.  \\nExpenses for the quarter were down 3% sequentially, mainly from decreases in salaries and non -personnel \\ncosts, and with non -recurring items in the fourth quarter falling away, outweighing increases this quarter in \\nvariable and Financial Advisor compensatio n.    \\nSlide 14 – Personal & Corporate Banking (CHF)  \\nTurning to Personal and Corporate Banking on slide 14.  With good momentum and the front office teams \\nnow more closely aligned to strengthen client engagement, P&C increased pre -tax profit by 11% sequentially \\nto 774 million Swiss francs, its highest PBT si nce before the Credit Suisse acquisition.  \\nRevenues were up by 4% with gains across each significant revenue line, further supported by a 47% decline \\nin credit loss expense quarter -on-quarter.  \\nDeposit balances in Swiss franc terms remained roughly stable, with inflows in personal banking largely offset \\nby outflows in corporate balances with lower liquidity value.  This was a strong outcome considering the current \\nrates environment in Switzerland  and the ongoing work in the business to gain share of wallet and to improve \\nbalance sheet efficiency, supporting our net interest margin in 1Q.   \\nNII increased by 3% sequentially to 1.1 billion, principally as higher re -investment income more than offset \\ndeclines in revenue from lower lending volumes and ongoing deposit mix shifts.   \\nIn the second quarter, we expect a mid -to-high single -digit percentage decrease in P&C’s NII in US dollars, more \\nthan offsetting the first quarter’s sequential gains, especially as the effects of the Swiss central bank’s March \\ninterest rate cut hit through for a full quarter.  \\n \\n Page 9 of 24 \\n For the full year 2024, we likewise expect a mid -to-high single -digit percentage decline in P&C ’s NII versus 4Q23 \\nannualized.  We see NII  holding broadly steady in US dollar terms in 2H24, as P&C’s balance sheet management \\nefforts to improve loan margins help to mitigate lower loan and deposit volumes , as well as the modeled effects \\nof two further 25 basis -point rate cuts in Switzerland.  The outlook also includes a 50 million annualized \\nheadwind from the effects of higher minimum reserve requirements at the Swiss central bank.  \\nTransaction -based revenues were up 9% in the quarter principally on strong corporate client engagement.  \\nRecurring net fee income gained 5% sequentially on higher client asset balances supported by net new inflows \\nin the quarter.  \\nCredit loss expense was 39 million as PPA adjustments offset a similar level of charges on impaired loans \\nacquired from Credit Suisse.  \\nOperating expenses were up 4% quarter -on-quarter , principally due to higher staff costs in Switzerland and a \\nlease accounting credit recorded in the comparable quarter ..    \\nSlide 15 – Asset Management  \\nAs illustrated on slide 15, underlying PBT in Asset Management decreased by 2% quarter -on-quarter to 182 \\nmillion, as lower revenues were only partially offset by reduced operating expenses.  \\nWhile net management fees were steady quarter -on quarter, the sequential drop in the top line is explained by \\nfourth quarter revenues, which included the gain from the sale of an investment stake , as well as seasonally \\nhigher performance fees.  \\nNet new money in the quarter was 21 billion due to several big -ticket inflows in mainly passive equity and fixed \\nincome funds, including money markets.  We also continue to see client demand for SMA, sustainable \\ninvestments and our Private Markets capabilities.  \\nOpex decreased by 7% to 594 million, mainly from lower personnel, technology and litigation costs.  As I \\nhighlighted during the investor update in February, we aim to improve operating leverage in Asset Management \\nby focusing on cost optimization across the entire division and realizing synergies from migration of clients onto \\nUBS infrastructure over the course of 2025.   \\nSlide 16 – Investment Bank  \\nOn to  our Investment Bank’s performance on slide 16.  As in prior quarters, we compare the results of the \\ncombined IB with standalone UBS performance on a year -on-year basis.  \\nOperating profit was 404 million, marking the IB’s first profitable quarter since the acquisition, and broad \\ncompletion of the restructuring of the parts of Credit Suisse’s IB that are core to our own.  Return on attributed \\nequity also turned positive and reached 10% for the quarter.  \\nUnderlying revenues increased by 4% to 2.5 billion.  Underscoring our efforts to increase the IB’s market share \\nin the US, the IB’s top line increased by 29% in the region.   \\nBanking maintained its strong momentum with overall revenues up by 52%.  Notably, we also increased market \\nshare in the US, where Banking now contributes a third of total IB revenues, up from less than 20% a year ago.  \\n \\n Page 10 of 24 \\n We continue to be pleased with our performance in Capital Markets, up 85% year -over-year, as LCM, DCM \\nand ECM all saw increased activity levels, building on the momentum we saw in the fourth quarter.   \\nAdvisory revenues increased by 11% as we continue to outperform the global fee pool.  The recovery in M&A \\nis continuing, particularly in the US, albeit with  more subdued  client sentiment and activity in APAC , where we \\nhave a large share of the market .   \\nWith our Banking coverage teams now fully integrated, our pipeline offers encouraging revenue potential in \\nthe second half of 2024 and into 2025.  \\nRevenues in Markets declined 5% to 1.9 billion, but were up 6% year -over-year in the Americas.  Equities \\nrevenues, driven by Cash Equities, were up 3%.  FRC, where we remain underweight by design, was down \\n21% with both Rates and FX affected by lower volat ility and decreased client activity.  \\nOperating expenses rose 8%, predominantly from additional costs related to personnel onboarded from Credit \\nSuisse’s investment bank, but, importantly, dropped 4% sequentially, while revenues were up 32% quarter -\\non-quarter.   \\nSlide 17 – Non-core and Legacy  \\nMoving to Slide 17. Non -core and Legacy’s pre -tax profit in the quarter was 197 million, supported by 1 billion \\nin revenues principally from gains on position exits.   \\nIn addition to the securitized products transaction I mentioned earlier, the business recognized proceeds from \\nthe close -out of several complex and longer -dated positions above their book carrying amounts, including in its \\nconduit and corporate loan books and within its longevity portfolio.   \\nDespite the strong revenue performance in the first quarter, we continue to expect the NCL book to ultimately \\nclose out across its various positions at more or less their current carrying values, meaning it is still appropriate \\nto assume revenues of nil go ing forward , net of hedging and funding costs .   \\nIt is also important to reiterate that, in pursuit of our priorities in NCL, we may at times sacrifice P&L on position \\nexits to eliminate costs and release sub -optimally deployed capital.  \\nNevertheless , given the strong revenue performance in 1Q along with the significant progress we’ve made on \\ncosts, we now expect NCL’s full -year 2024 underlying PBT to be a loss of around 2.5 billion versus the expected \\n4 billion loss we signaled in February.  \\nAs Sergio highlighted, we made substantial progress in reducing the NCL portfolio in the quarter, decreasing \\nRWAs by 16 billion, principally in credit and market risk.  In just nine months, we’ve run down 28 billion, or \\nalmost a third, of NCL’s risk weight ed assets.  \\nFrom an LRD perspective, the overall portfolio is down by roughly half from 2Q23, after a further reduction of \\n49 billion in the first quarter.  \\nAs I covered earlier, a significant portion of the Group’s overall opex decline this quarter was delivered by NCL, \\nwhich saw a 26% sequential drop in underlying costs to 769 million, primarily due to lower third party, real \\nestate, and technology costs.    \\n \\n Page 11 of 24 \\n Slide 18 – Significant progress in reducing financial resource consumption  \\nMoving to capital and financial resources on slide 18.  CET1 capital was broadly flat in the quarter with profits \\ngenerated in 1Q offsetting our dividend accruals and 1.3 billion in negative currency translation effects.  \\nAs we’ve highlighted, we made significant progress this quarter in reducing financial resource consumption \\nacross the bank from both the active run -down of NCL as well as balance sheet management initiatives across \\nthe core businesses.  This resulted in a 4% sequential decline in RWA and a 6% reduction in LRD.   \\nCredit and counterparty risk RWAs dropped by 11 billion from position sales and roll -offs, as well as from risk \\nmodel mitigation, with currency effects contributing another 11 billion to the quarter -on-quarter decline.  \\nMarket risk RWAs increased by 3 billion as asset -size decreases were more than offset by the effects of model \\nupdates from the  integration of time decay into our VaR calculations.   \\nSlide 19 – Confidence in our balance sheet for all seasons enables efficient funding  \\nSlide 19 illustrates our strong capital position with a CET1 capital ratio of 14.8%, increasing by 40 basis points \\nover the course of 1Q.   \\nAs previously highlighted, a  surplus  above our CET1 capital ratio target of around 14% is necessary to cater for \\nexpected volatility in our reported profitability as we execute on the various phases of the integration.   \\nOur LCR at quarter end was 220%, reflecting ample levels of liquidity to remain compliant with the new Swiss \\nliquidity ordinance that went live at the start of the year.  \\nWe remain focused on raising stable deposits with tenors, products and counterparty selection resulting in \\nhigher liquidity value.  And, we continue to apply discipline on pricing.  \\nStrong investor demand for our name in capital markets and improving conditions allowed us to complete \\nnearly half of our full -year funding plan during the first quarter. We successfully placed over 5 billion in \\nattractively -priced HoldCo in January, and 1 .5 billion in AT1 across two transactions in February at spreads that \\nwere around 100 basis points inside our heavily subscribed November placement.  \\nSimilarly, secondary market spreads continued to tighten post-acquisition , having now dropped to February \\n2023 levels, and together with ongoing diversification of our funding sources, are supporting our plan to lower \\nfunding costs by around 1 billion by 2026.  \\nAs part of the broadening out of our funding sources, we structured two first -of-their-kind transactions  for \\nUBS, including an issue of 1 billion in euro -denominated covered bonds, and a private placement for size via \\nrepo of a portion of our portfolio of Swiss franc -denominated covered bonds.   \\nI would highlight that  these trades were priced below the spread on the outstanding ELA line with the Swiss \\ncentral bank.   \\nAs to ELA, we have now repaid 29 billion of this line extended to Credit Suisse pre -acquisition, including 9 \\nbillion Swiss francs just yesterday.  We expect to repay the remaining 9 billion in the coming months.  \\nOverall, our balance sheet management initiatives, together with actions on the funding side  that I just \\ndescribed, improved our loan to deposit ratio this quarter and narrowed the funding gap we inherited from \\n \\n Page 12 of 24 \\n Credit Suisse. Importantly, our efforts are helping us to offset NII headwinds, and are contributing to the \\nstrength of our overall liquidity and funding profile.  \\nWith that, let’s open for questions.  \\n \\n Page 13 of 24 \\n Analyst Q&A (CEO and CFO)  \\n \\nAlastair Ryan, Bank of America  \\nYeah. Thank you. Good morning. A billion dollar beat in the quarter. I never did quite get the hang of \\nforecasting lark. Just on that then -- so non -core, very strong performance and appreciate the updated runoff \\nprofile you give us on slide 6. Is there any reason that you're just reverting to natural runoff or can we expect \\ncontinued sales if markets stay favorable bec ause clearly there's quite a meaningful driver of the very \\nfavorable capital ratio and the interactions of all of those.  \\nAnd then secondly, the project to improve the revenue to risk -weighted assets in wealth management, are \\npresumably, you wouldn't represent the Q1 performances kind of the payoff of that project is? It's too early \\nbut just what's the profile of that project? How long is that repricing sitting on the net new asset generation \\nand has it started ? Thank you.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nAlastair, before I pass to Todd, I wanted to -- you were the first to ask the question not by coincidence since I \\nunderstand it's your last day at the office, so.  \\nAlastair Ryan, Bank of America  \\nYes, yes . Thank you , Sergio . \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nWell, enjoy -- enjoy your time of f going forward. So, I'll pass it over to Todd. Thank you.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nHey, Alastair. Thanks for the questions. So on NCL, I mean first reverting to natural runoff. I mean, we've \\nbeen consistent in just reflecting the natural runoff profile. What I think the slide 6 really does indicate is, it \\nreally narrows that, that delta between where we started, you know, as you can see where we set our \\nambition is to reduce to 5% and , you know , that the natural runoff profile has really come in.  \\nYou see that the delta between the natural runoff profile and where we , our ambition is narrowed. So that \\nshould, eliminate whatever uncertainty was considered, but I do think that it's appropriate still to reflect it \\nthat way in terms of, you know, whether we can do more of course we're going to continue to do what we \\ncan. \\nWe'll try to position -- we'll try to exit positions, at or above their, their book values wherever possible. But, \\nyou know, it's appropriate to continue to stick with our guidance on NCL, in terms of , you know,  our \\napproach, and in terms of our expectations around revenues.  \\nOn GWM in terms of revenue over the RWA, I mentioned that we're starting to see progress, which of course \\ndoes suggest you asked, has it started and it has. In fact, it started at the end of last year and the business is \\nquite active in it.  \\n \\n Page 14 of 24 \\n And, and so, we would expect that we're going to continue to make progress on driving up RWA efficiency \\nwith respect to revenues in that respect over the course of the next couple of years.  You asked how long that \\nwill impact. How long will it go? How long will it impact net new assets? We said, it's going to take the better \\npart of two years which is why we g uided  net new assets of around 200 billion over that two -year timeframe. \\nAnd we think that's the appropriate guidance still.  \\nAlastair Ryan, Bank of America  \\nOkay. Thank you . And Sergio, thank you.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nSure. Pleasure.  \\nChris Hallam, Goldman Sach s \\nYeah. So two for me, by the end of the year, I guess, you'll be effectively halfway through the integration \\nprocess in terms of gro ss savings. So as you get through that process, are you starting to get a better picture \\nof what you could expect for the net savings figure in relation to the 13 billion? Todd, I think you mentioned \\nthe majority earlier. And does that change at all the phasing of the multi -year return on core tier 1 p ath you \\nlaid out the full year?  \\nAnd then second question. Sergio, you referenced earlier that insufficient capital didn't cause the collapse of \\nCS and I guess, in the final instance, what we really saw was a crisis in client confidence that drove that \\nliquidity shortfall. So when we talk about capital distribution, it's sort of automatic to assume that higher or \\nearlier capital distribution, results in lower capital ratios, which in turn, reduces resilience.  \\nBut when you talk to clients, how important is that distribution ambition as an indicator and driver of \\nconfidence  in the business i.e ,. like could you argue that ultimately aligning your distribution strategy more \\nclosely with the distribution policies we see elsewhere in European financials , actually increases client \\nconfidence in the business and improves resilience. There's a big perception  difference basically between the \\nfirm that ’s buying back stock versus a firm that ’s issuing stock?  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nYeah. Hey Chris, I ’ll take the first so on, on whether the opex progress that we saw, sort of informs a better \\nview on the net that we ’ll get to. Look, you know I think we're quite pleased with that 1Q operating expense \\nperformance.  \\nWe did highlight that we expect gross sa ves to be halfway to our 13 billion ambitions at the end of the year \\nwhich is a bit better than we highlighted in February in large part because of the 1Q performance that we \\nsaw. But look, we still -- our ambition is a cost -to-income ratio of less than 70%  at the end of 2026. That's \\nwhat we're really focused on to manage to and so how we pace any investments, which we'll continue to \\nmake in, for example, the resilience of our infrastructure, the organic growth in our core businesses, how we \\npace that will b e a function of the revenue environment. So it is still -- it is still way too early to change that \\nperspective. But of course, we are pleased with the opex performance we saw in 1Q.  \\nAs to how that impacts on the return on CET1 path that you mentioned, I would say that coupled with the \\nupdated NCL full -year PBT guidance I gave , would have roughly 100 to - slightly above basis point impact on \\n \\n Page 15 of 24 \\n the return on CET1, but I would still say mid single -digits is the right way to think about the full year ROCET1 , \\neven with the 1Q performance that we produced.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nYes, Chris, first of all, of course, you know, having a strong capital position and a balance sheet for all \\nseasons, as we call it, having a strict risk management approach and policies and being very disciplined in a \\nway we consume and manage all our resources is the pillar number one of our strategy.  And I think it's \\nalmost a prerequisite to create the trust that clients need to have in any bank or any organization.  \\nSo in that sense, I would only add that another very important indicator, which sometimes is in conflict  with \\nclients is your funding cost. Of course, our clients would like to have always a higher returns on the deposits \\nand the investment they place with us. But on the other hand, when they see our funding cost being as \\ncompetitive as we have now, they have the ultimate confirmation of the strength and the solidity of our \\nfranchise . \\nSo ultimately, at the end of the day, it's always a trade -off between different dynamics by, I would say, \\nemotional and psychological dynamics. But I can only tell you that, of course, last but not least, having a full \\nalignment of client trust and satisfa ction, having shareholders being happy, and having your employees being \\nhappy is the ultimate way to create sustainable value and trust in any bank. And this is our philosophy.  \\nSo of course, having an ability to compete in terms of growth and our global ambitions, but at the same time, \\nbeing able to deliver attractive returns to shareholders, it's very important to influence the three stakeholders I \\nmentioned.  \\nChris Hallam, Goldman Sach s \\nRight. Thank you.  \\nKian Abou hossein, JP Morgan  \\nYes. Thank you for taking my question. I have a lot of detailed questions, but I wanted to ask two questions \\nactually to Sergio, if I may. The first one is Sergio, your first comment on the call today were, we were asked \\nto do a critical role in Switzerlan d. And -- the key here is you were asked to buy a distressed asset, a G -SIB \\nasset and when you buy something, which you are asked to buy, you clearly are in control of the process. \\nAnd I would assume just like you do in an M&A transaction, you know that be tter than me, you have a MAC  \\nclause and in this instance, I would assume after all the financial crisis issues that we had in 2012 -2013 with \\nmergers  by regulators , there would have been an agreement that there's not over -regulation for UBS post the \\nNewC o transaction. And I wanted to see if there's anything like this.  \\nThe second question I have is Sergio you also comment that the assessment of capital will be based on what \\nthe final outcome is once we better know the outcome of these regulations. And one option is also to look at \\nyour legal entities and maybe close some of the legal entities or exit , and clearly a lot of capital is tied up in the \\nUS. They make lower returns if I look at US wealth ex-LatAm as well as the US IB , I assume its lower returns. So \\none option would be a restructuring or exiting of markets to rather than reducing capital return. I wanted to \\nsee if that is also an alternative. Thank you.  \\n \\n \\n Page 16 of 24 \\n Sergio P. Ermotti  \\nThank you. Yeah, v ery good question. Yeah, I think that -- let me put it that way that some of the conditions \\nthat were discussed and agreed at over that weekend that were clearly, defined and communicated for \\nexample, the one in respect of the antitrust and the competitive nature in our local markets that has been \\nvery well defined and agreed. Others , I would say , were also discussed and agreed.  \\nLet me put it that way. I'm not so sure we can talk about a MAC clau se but as I mentioned in my opening \\nremarks, we are delivering on our commitments. So I probably stop here.  \\nAnd in respect of the amount of capital and I think it's clearly too early to speculate or respond to \\nspeculations around the capital. I just want to underline that when we talk about our parent company , you \\nknow, UBS had already up for -- one of the best in class capitalization, the quality of our capital in the parent \\ncompany was very strong. What I mentioned that is already embedded in our plan. We are absorbing USD 9 \\nbillion of concession granted to Credit Suisse. We are absorbing the progressive buffers that will come in as a \\nconsequence of market share and size. And we believe this is feasible and is part of the plan.  \\nSo, before we speculate about what we would do  to respond to any other changes in regulatory \\nrequirements, we need to understand what they are, because , believe me , we have not been consulted. We \\ndon't know what they are. And so, we need to have the full picture before we respond to this kind of \\nsituations.  \\nBut let me just say that having a global franchise, being competitive globally, is what makes us a very attractive \\nbank to our clients. Shrinking back to greatness is not a strategy and is not what will serve , not only our clients \\nand our shareholders well, but I'm also convinced is not going to serve well, Switzerland and i ts ambitions to \\nbe one of the leading financial center in the world. That's pretty clear to me.  \\nKian Abouhossein, JP Morgan  \\nThank you.  \\nGiulia Aurora Miotto, Morgan Stanley  \\nYeah. Hi. Good morning. So two questions from me as well. The first one just going back on the capital \\nproposal again. And you said, you were not con sulted  on this document and you need to see what the final \\nproposal looks like. So looking forward, what are the next steps? Do we need to wait until June or are you \\nnow part of the discussion , do we expect to have more clarity throughout the year? That's the first question.  \\nAnd then the second question more related to the quarter, there was some performance in transaction fee s \\nbetter than I expected in wealth. I'm wondering, is this just a transitory Q1 thing or is this continuing and what \\nshould we expect there? Thank you.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nI pick up  the first one, and then I'll pass it to Todd for the second. I mean, the reason - we are not yet clear if \\nwe're going to be formally part of any consultation or any discussions, of course, as I mentioned in my \\nremarks, we will make sure that our considerations are heard by the regulatory bodies and policymakers and \\nso that we can contri bute to  fact-based discussion s.  \\n \\n Page 17 of 24 \\n And of course, we also hope that the report of the investigating commission of the parliaments will highlight \\nsome of the reasons why Credit Suisse failed, and that should be a crucial element in contributing to fact-based \\ndiscussions on future regulations. So, June, as you mentioned, June, June is not a credible dat e because the \\ncommission is not expected to report before the end of the year. I also think that .. \\nGiulia Miotto, Morgan Stanley  \\nJune 2025 I meant, sorry.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nThat one is, I don't know about June 2025. I think that it's very unlikely that we're going to have more clarity \\nabout this matter in terms of what it means before year end or the early -- or even the early part of next year. \\nSo in the meantime, we have to  accept some level of uncertainty around this topic.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nYeah, hi Giulia , on the second question about TRX in GWM. So yeah, very strong 1Q. In terms of how we -- \\nhow one should think about it, overall in going forward, I'd say a few things. I mean, naturally, the \\nenvironment needs to be conducive to strong transactional flows – and 1Q was, but I would really highlight \\nthat it wasn ’t so much just beta.  \\nBut actually, it ’s an environment where you started to see risks come on, you saw some uncertainty, and it ’s \\nan environment that plays to our strengths, where we were able to advise in particular, across our regions in \\nmore complex, structured products where we saw significant volume up, so really played to our strengths and \\nthen also , I think structurally reflects a couple of things in addition that I would say  it gives us confidence as \\nwe look out forward.  \\nOne is that the align product shelf , so across Credit Suisse and UBS coming together, and the way we've \\napproached clients from that sense. And on the US side, as I highlighted, just really borrowing from the \\nplaybook outside the US, inside the US to really approach clients more jointly with the investment bank is also \\npaying off.  \\nSo we see there are some structural things that bode well as we look out. Of course, the environment needs to \\nbe conducive, but also in an environment like the current one is one that plays to our strengths as mentioned \\nand really allows us to drive transactional flows higher . \\nGiulia Miotto, Morgan Stanley  \\nThanks.  \\nJeremy Sigee , BNP Paribas Exane  \\nThank you. Good morning. Two questions, please. One is, you talked about the Investment Bank and the core \\nbusinesses that you've retained from Credit Suisse and the people you've brought over. I just wanted to – are \\nthey now fully productive in revenue terms ? Or is there some lag still to come through, as those people ramp \\nup? Are they up to speed already at this point?  \\n \\n Page 18 of 24 \\n And then my second question is sort of, again, on the capital theme. I saw in the report, you reiterate your \\nintention to do the 1 billion of buybacks in the second half of this year. I guess, that's a small enough amount \\nthat you can do it pretty much reg ardless of the new capital proposals. But I just wanted to hear your \\nthoughts on that.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nWell, let me take the first question is very  – you know,  of course everybody is now up and running and \\nproductive. And – but when you look at Banking, as you know, what does it mean being productive?   It does,  \\nyou know , there is a phase of going out and pitching and winning mandates and then it takes time until they \\nget executed. So, in a sense if you are asking me if they are productive in pitching and being engaged with \\nclients, they are . Everybody is full speed.  The momentum in winning mandates is great. You could see it in the \\nfourth quarter. In the first quarter, we have executed many of them. And we are very comfortable that the \\ninvestments and the trajectory of growth that we see going forward, if market conditions stay there to allow \\nthe execution of those mandates , are very promising.  \\nIn respect of the billion , so I think that you know, at this stage, the only constraints we have right now is the \\nwaiting until the parent bank merger is executed. We expect this to be in at the end of May and if everything \\ngoes through successfully , pending the regulatory approvals that we need , we intend to restart the share \\nbuybacks with up to a billion dollars for 2024.  \\nJeremy Sigee , BNP Paribas Exane  \\nVery helpful, thank you.  \\nAndrew Coombs , Citigroup  \\nGood morning. Two questions please, bas ic follow  ups. Firstly on the Non-core result, obviously a tremendous \\nresult both in terms of the RWA run -down but also the gains that you've booked during the quarter. Thank \\nyou for the revised guidance for the full year.  I just wanted to better understand the source of those gains in \\nQ1, I think you said conduit and corporate loan books and longevity portfolio. You  then don't expect that to \\nrepeat going forward. Is that because the low hanging fruit has already been achieved or because you're now \\nselling a different type of a sset, or anything  you can elaborate there will be  helpful.  \\nAnd then the second question, thank you for  the opening remark s, Sergio . On the parent bank capital , I just \\nwanted to check , the 9 billon you referenced , is that in relation to a 400% risk -weight  on foreign subsidiaries, \\nor is it the 300% as i t currently is phased? And then more broadly , a question  to the both of you , in the event \\nthat the risk weight on foreign subsidiaries does go up, to what extent do you think you can mitigate that \\nthrough the fungibility of capital , dividend , trapped capital and so forth? Thank you.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nHi, Andrew. I'll address the first question. I mean, in terms of the source of the gains, I think as , you know, as  \\nyou mentioned, and as of course I highlighted , it came from a number of the sort of sectors within NCL, \\nConduit , and Corporate Loans, Longevity , Securitized Products. We're also seeing, you know, strength  in \\nCredit and Equities and Macro as well. And, you know, the team has been doing a great job in unwinding \\nthese complex, longer dated transactions. And that continues to be what they're going to be focused on \\ndoing. So the source of the gains comes from , you know, the ability to add a lot of value to these complex \\ntransactions.  And you know, to be able to get the transactions closed out at levels that are above book value.  \\n \\n Page 19 of 24 \\n And as I highlighted, that's not an expectation that people should continue to have , not least just given that \\nsometimes we're going to make decisions to get out of positions where we know there's significant cost \\ntakeout or there's suboptimal capital  at the moment, it's very suboptimal from a capital efficiency perspective, \\nand so getting  out would  release  that. So they're going to be a number of factors that  – which is why , you \\nknow, we don't see 1Q repeating.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nSo if I can add  on that one , before I touch on the second question . I think that's the  – first of all, there is \\ndefinitely no low hanging fruit and if you look at our natural decay  profile change, it shows you that we are \\nnot really going for easy to sell but rather complex transaction s that also helps in many cases to unwind costs , \\nbecause priority number one in Non-core is to take down cost , and not necessarily to take down risk \\nweighted assets and market or credit risk weighted assets.   \\nSo, in that sense, it's very important that in many cases we are able, thanks to the good work the team is \\ndoing in managing these unwinds , to leverage the fact that we are not a forced seller. We are only going to \\ndispose assets when they create value to shareholders. And that's a – is a completely different position to be \\nin because our capital is strong. We can allow some delays or some time to elapse between the two.  \\nNow on the 9 billion , so there are two factors actually; one is the 250 % risk weightings and 400 % for foreign \\ncompanies and the elimination of the filter – of the regulatory filter that Credit Suisse had. The two combined \\naccount for 9 billion.  \\nAndrew Coombs , Citigroup  \\nAnd the ability to mitigate any increase in the foreign subsidiaries going forward ? Assum e it’s something \\nyou're already w orking  on given the already base increase , to what extent you th ink you could accelerate \\nthat. \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nNo the mitigation – look the mitigation I go back to is – I mean, I have to – it’s like replay, push the button \\nagain and replay what I told you or what I said before, we cannot speculate or respond to speculation or do \\nanalysis on things that we don't know. What we know is that we're going to hold , as a consequence of the \\nCredit Suisse acquisition , 9 plus 10 billion, so almost 20 billion of additional capital on an already very strong \\ncapital position UBS had . That's the fact. The rest , I don't know and we will comment when we know more.  \\nAndrew Coombs , Citigroup  \\nBrilliant, v ery clear. Thank you for that.  \\nAnke Reingen , RBC \\nYeah, thank you very much for taking my question. I'm just – I'm sorry to follow  up, just one thing. I mean, is \\nit fair to say that a result of the uncertainty and not really changing any step in your strategy and execution of \\nthe merger and specifically, with Q4 results , you mentioned, the potential amortization of additional D TA, just \\nconfirming this – at the current stage, this is going ahead.  \\n \\n Page 20 of 24 \\n And then on the net new assets, the 17 billion  [edit: 27 billion]  in Q1, that ’d be running below , if I were \\nthinking about $100 billion for this year  – should  it be rather than 100 billion this year , is it more like the 200 \\nbillion over the year s – or two years  – and more back end loaded towards the 2025 to reach the 200 billion ? \\nAnd has the decline in relationship managers had any impact on the net new assets growth in Q1 ? In the \\npast, you gave us some numbers about departed  relationship managers and the assets they have taken with \\nthem. Is that  the case , as being relatively low? Thank you very much.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nThank you, I’ll take the first question. I think that , Anke, I think  – this is a very complex integration, and we \\ncannot afford to be distracted in the execution of it. So we are sticking to our strategy. We are sticking to our \\nplan. We need to do that and at the same time, stay close to our clients. And so that's the reason why \\nengaging in hypothetical change of strategy or methodology we use in assess our – anything that goes \\naround capital – would be absolutely very distracting and not in the best interest of any stakeholders , because \\nwhat we want to have is a successful completion of this integration. And so we stay focused on the existing \\nstrategy and our approach . \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nYeah Anke, on th e second question, in terms of net new assets in GWM. I would just reiterate that  the \\ntrajectory that we highlighted over the next two years is, among other things, a function of the financial \\nresource optimization and balance sheet initiatives that the team is hard at work in undertaking . So 27 billion \\nin the quarter is a strong result, we're on track to deliver on our ambitions, which we said was 200 billion \\nover the course of two years. So I would continue to think about that in those terms.  \\nIn terms of the RM s who have left, you mentioned that we had given some numbers in the past. Yeah, I \\nmean, that has continued just to taper. As an impact, just given the number of RM s who have left , has \\nbecome sort of a non -topic at this point in time.  In terms of any current period, and in terms of the assets \\nthat they’ve taken with them, it is a very small percentage , ultimately, of the given – especially given the fact \\nthat the RM workforce in Credit Suisse is down 40% from the end of 2022 levels, and we've been able to \\nretain the lion  share of the assets. So, we consider that to be sort of a story not terribly worth following, and \\nin the end, we stay focused on our plans and our commitments.  \\nAnke Reingen , RBC  \\nThank you. Can I just ask on the DTA please? Are you reiterating that we expect to convert that 2 billion and \\nthe 500 million you talked about with Q4 results?  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nYeah. There's no change in terms of our approach to DTA s at the current time, An ke. \\nAnke Reingen , RBC  \\nThank you very much. Thank you.  \\n \\n \\n \\n Page 21 of 24 \\n Benjamin Goy , Deutsche Bank  \\nHi. Good morning. Two questions, please. One on your favorite topic , capital . Just conceptually , trying to \\nunderstand, because when the press i t’s reported , or the Minister of Finance speaks , about  capital , and we \\nnaturally assume it’s CET1 capital, but do you think it  could  also partially include additional tier 1  capital, \\nwhich might make it more manageable for you?  \\nAnd then secondly, on your  Global  Wealth Management net new loans in the quarter, another decline , it’s \\nvery similar to the Q4 decline. Just trying to reconcile that with your risk appetite returning statement  – being \\nconscious of the yield curve ’s still not  favorable but wondering if it's also more of a risk alignment still going \\non in the background, which is why your outstanding  remains negative ? Thank you very much.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nBenjamin, the first one is very short. As I say, we don ’t speculate or respond to speculation in respect of any \\nnumbers that has been flagged out there. So it ’s not – we are not in a position to understand where and how \\nthose  numbers are calculated, therefore we refrain from doing that.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nYeah, and Benjamin hi. On the GWM net new lending side, we are seeing continued deleveraging, some of \\nthat is market driven and some of that – i.e. rates driven, and some of that is as a function of the resource \\noptimization work that we're doing. So, that's an outcome that we're managing , to the extent it is the la tter, \\nwe are looking to drive higher revenues. And therefore, I ’m looking for the NIM to sort of hold up in that \\nrespect , because we're improving the revenue o ver RWA consideration.  \\nBut obviously, in the current rates environment, too, we're seeing either the ends of deleveraging and still yet \\nsome reticence to re -lever in some of our regions. So I expect that  we won't have a lot of momentum on re -\\nlevering in the current rates environment until we start to see rates come down , over – if, assuming they do – \\nover the next, say 12 to 18 months, so that external factor won't be , to me , a big driver in terms of \\nreleverage.  \\nBenjamin Goy , Deutsche Bank  \\nUnderstood. Thank you very much.  \\nPiers Brown , HSBC  \\nYeah. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Just two f rom me, just coming back on the cost issue, and \\nthe costs take out in the quarter in the NCL unit. I mean, it's quite impressive , you're down 26% quarter -on-\\nquarter.  And the cost takeout seems to be tracking more or less in line with the asset reduction . Just, I mean, \\nthe question is, should we expect that sort of linear relationship to continue or was it something particular in \\nterms of front loading costs takeout in the first quarter in NCL?  \\nAnd then the second question is back to regulation, not on capital but just wondering if there's anything in \\nany of the remarks, comments, reports, published by the Competition Commission that we need to be \\nmindful of, just in terms of the domestic market shares of the new group. Thanks.  \\n \\n \\n Page 22 of 24 \\n Todd Tuckner  \\nHey Piers. In terms of the first question on the NCL cost takeout. There isn't a linear relationship , I would say. \\nIt's, it could be , the relationship really doesn't have to flow linearly.  And that's because, the cost takeout will \\noften come as a result of taking out a portfolio that sits on a given system or supported by a given \\ninfrastructure or application that we ’re able to shut down. But there is of course, a relationship between the \\nasset takeout and the cost takeout.  I wouldn't say it's linear because you can have, you can be taking out \\nportions of a portfolio that still needs at least  a large share of the head count supporting that , whether it's the \\nfront office or mid or back, that's still supporting the broader portfolio.  And if you're not really able to \\ndecommission the associated technology, you may not get the sa ves there. So not linear, but for sure, it's \\nsomething we watch very carefully and we're pleased to see that it is moving with a reasonably high -degree \\nof correlation.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nNow on the competitive position. Let's forget for a second that we have a crystal clear agreement on that \\ntopic . Even if you go down to the substance, which is , I think, is relevant for us, for consumers, for clients, or \\neverybody to understand.  When you look at facts, it's quite clear that we have no dominant position in \\nSwitzerland, in banking. So I think that no matter if you look at deposits, at loans and mortgages, you look at \\nbranch  – number of branches ; in any dimension, UBS is not the largest bank in Switzerland in that sense.  I \\nthink we are the leading bank in Switzerland because of our capabilities, but that should not be confused \\nwith market share and size. So in that sense, we are fairly comfortable that both the agreement  and the facts \\nsupport our position that our plan is the right one to pursue.  \\nPiers Brown , HSBC  \\nThank you.  \\nTom Hallett , KBW  \\nHi. Morning. So just a quick one on Wealth Management NII, I think you were baking in three US rate cuts for \\nthis year in your guidance . If that was zero, what would that – or how would that alter your guidance?  \\nAnd then secondly, on the treatment of software intangible s, I suppose  it's fair to say it gets a bit more of a \\nbenefit relative to your European peers. I mean , if you were to align the ru les with Europe, what sort of \\nimpact would that ha ve on your capital? Thank you.  \\nSergio P. Ermotti  \\nSo, on the second question, as I said before, we are not speculating on any change in our regulatory \\nframework. The only thing I can say is that both in absolute global terms , but also vis -à-vis the European \\npeers, we have a pretty strong capital position, not only in absolute terms, but also the quality of our capital \\nbase.  \\nTodd Tuckner  \\nHey Tom, on GWM NII, yes, we modeled in as mentioned three US dollar  rate cuts . If there were fewer than \\nthose  – and Sergio even commented earlier that there is some upside , but of course, in our NII, but of course \\nthat depends on client behavior. It depends on how the balance sheet, you know , behaves. So statically, yes, \\n \\n Page 23 of 24 \\n that would be corrected to be upside.  If there were no rate cuts, you probably have some uptick of a point or \\ntwo on the NII. But of course, you know, we need to consider the dynamic relationship between client \\nbehavior and our balance sheet. So it's difficult to predict, but yes, I would just take away that – likely to be \\nsome degree of upside, all other things equal.  \\nTom Hallett , KBW  \\nOkay. Thank you.  \\nSarah Mackey  \\nThank you. I think there are no further questions. So with that we can close the call. And thank you, Sergio and \\nTodd for joining us today. We look forward to speaking to everyone again with our 2Q results.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n Page 24 of 24 \\n Cautionary statement regarding forward -looking statements | This document  contains statements that constitute “forward -looking statements,”  \\nincluding but not limited to management’s outlook for UBS’s financial performance, statements relating to the anticipated eff ect of transactions and \\nstrategic initiatives on UBS’s business and future development and goals or intentions to achieve climate,  sustainability and other social objectives. While \\nthese forward -looking statements represent UBS’s judgments, expectations and objectives concerning the matters described, a number of risks , uncertainties \\nand other important factors could cause actual dev elopments and results to differ materially from UBS’s expectations. In particular, terrorist activity and \\nconflicts in the Middle East, as well as the continuing Russia –Ukraine war, may have significant impacts on global markets, exacerbate global inflatio nary \\npressures, and slow global growth. In addition, the ongoing conflicts may continue to cause significant population displaceme nt, and lead to shortages of \\nvital commodities, including energy shortages and food insecurity outside the areas immediately i nvolved in armed conflict. Governmental responses to the \\narmed conflicts, including, with respect to the Russia –Ukraine war, coordinated successive sets of sanctions on Russia and Belarus, and Russian and \\nBelarusian entities and nationals, and the uncertai nty as to whether the ongoing conflicts will widen and intensify, may continue to have significant adverse \\neffects on the market and macroeconomic conditions, including in ways that cannot be anticipated. UBS’s acquisition of the Cr edit Suisse Group has \\nmaterially changed our outlook and strategic direction and introduced new operational challenges. The integration of the Credit  Suisse entities into the UBS \\nstructure is expected to take between three and five years and presents significant risks, including the risks that UBS Group AG may be unable to achieve \\nthe cost reductions and other benefits contemplated by the transaction. This creates significantly greater uncertainty about forward -looking statements. \\nOther factors that may affect our performance and ability to achieve our plans, outlook and other objectives also include, but are not limited to: (i) the \\ndegree to which UBS is successful in the execution of its strategic plans, including its cost reduction and efficiency initia tives and its ability to m anage its \\nlevels of risk -weighted assets (RWA) and leverage ratio denominator (LRD), liquidity coverage ratio and other financial resources, including  changes in RWA \\nassets and liabilities arising from higher market volatility and the size of the combined Group; (ii) the degree to which UBS is successful in implementing \\nchanges to its businesses to meet changing market, regulatory and other conditions, including as a result of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group; (iii) \\nincreased inflation and interes t rate volatility in major markets; (iv) developments in the macroeconomic climate and in the markets in which UBS operates \\nor to which it is exposed, including movements in securities prices or liquidity, credit spreads, currency exchange rates, de teriora tion or slow recovery in \\nresidential and commercial real estate markets, the effects of economic conditions, including increasing inflationary pressur es, market developments, \\nincreasing geopolitical tensions, and changes to national trade policies on the f inancial position or creditworthiness of UBS’s clients and counterparties, as \\nwell as on client sentiment and levels of activity;

Ermotti  \\n \\nSlide 3 – Key messages  \\nThank you, Sarah and good morning, everyone.  \\nBefore we provide an update on how we are delivering on our priorities to meet our 2026 commitments, let \\nme share some highlights for 2024.  \\nStrong fourth -quarter results contributed to even stronger full -year financial performance, as we rebuilt \\nprofitability across our businesses. Our full -year net profit of 5.1 billion and underlying return on CET1 capital \\nof 8.7% reflect our unwavering comm itment to serving our clients, our diversified global franchise and the \\ndisciplined progress we have made on our integration plans.   \\nThroughout 2024, we maintained robust momentum as we captured growth across our global asset -gathering \\nplatform and gained market share in the Investment Bank in the areas where we have made strategic \\ninvestments.  \\nWith over 70 billion Swiss francs of loans granted or renewed during the year, and outstanding  balance  of 350 \\nbillion , we also maintained our commitment as a reliable partner for the Swiss economy, supporting families \\nand businesses to achieve their goals.   \\nWe delivered on all of our key integration milestones in 2024, including all major legal entity mergers, and the \\nsuccessful completion of our client account migrations in Luxembourg, Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan in the \\nfourth quarter.  \\nThis builds upon the successful integration of our key operating entities, the optimization of our balance sheet \\nand the reduction of costs and risk -weighted assets in Non -core and Legacy. Combined, these milestones have \\nsignificantly reduced the execution  risk of the Credit Suisse acquisition.   \\nAs a result, we remain confident in our ability to substantially complete the integration and deliver on our \\nfinancial targets by the end of 2026.  \\n \\n \\n Page 2 of 35 \\n \\n Our capital position remains robust as we ended the year with a CET1 capital ratio of 14.3%. For the financial \\nyear 2024 , we intend to propose a dividend of 90 cents, representing a 29% increase year -on-year. This is in \\nline with our intention to calibrate the proportion of cash dividends and share repurchases.  \\nAs we execute on our business and integration plans, we are building additional capacity to invest in our people \\nand to enhance our products and capabilities. This will allow us to better serve our clients and position UBS for \\nfuture success.  \\nThat includes the Americas, a region that remains a core component of both our asset -gathering foundation \\nand our capital -efficient business model.  \\nIn 2024, we started to make changes across the business to introduce new capabilities that will help increase \\nthe operating leverage of our platform, improve profitability and drive sustainable growth.  \\nAcross all of our businesses and supporting functions, we continue to invest in technology, leveraging our \\nstrong foundation to improve the client experience and enhance how we operate.  \\nNow, I hand over to Todd who will cover the fourth -quarter results.   \\n \\n \\n Page 3 of 35 \\n \\n Todd Tuckner  \\n \\nSlide 4 – Continued positive operating leverage in 4Q24 on higher revenues and lower costs  \\nThank you Sergio, and good morning everyone.   \\nThroughout my remarks, I’ll refer to underlying results in US dollars and make year -over-year comparisons, \\nunless stated otherwise.  \\nFor the fourth quarter, profit before tax tripled to 1.8 billion. Revenue momentum in our core franchises and \\ncost synergies across the Group drove a 12 -point improvement in operating leverage. Our EPS for the quarter \\nwas 23 cents with a 7.2% underlying return on CET1 capital.  Our underlying cost -income ratio was 82%.   \\nSlide 5 – 4Q24 net profit at 0.8bn, with integration continuing at pace  \\nLooking at the drivers of our fourth quarter Group performance on slide 5.  Total revenues rose by 6% to 11 \\nbillion, driven mainly by strong top -line growth in Global Wealth Management and the Investment Bank, \\npowered by our capabilities and advice in supp ortive market conditions.  \\nOperating expenses declined by 6% year -over-year to 9.1 billion, and were 1% lower sequentially as progress \\non synergies and a stronger US dollar more than offset the expected 4Q tick -up in non -personnel expenses.  \\nThis achievement was supported by a lower  overall employee count, which fell sequentially by another 2%, to \\nbelow 129 thousand.  The total staff count is down 27 thousand, or 17%, from our 2022 baseline.  \\nExcluding litigation, variable compensation and currency effects, operating expenses decreased by 9% year -\\nover-year.  The 4% quarter -over-quarter increase was caused by seasonally higher charges, including the UK \\nbank levy and increased marketing expenditu res.  \\nOur reported profit before tax for the quarter included 0.7 billion of revenue adjustments relating to PPA effects, \\na remeasurement loss of 0.1 billion on an investment in an associate, and 1.3 billion of integration -related \\nexpenses.  \\nReported net profit was 0.8 billion in the quarter on an effective tax rate of 26%.  We expect a similar tax rate \\nin the first quarter.    \\nSlide 6 – Global Wealth Management  \\nTurning to our business divisions, and starting with Global Wealth Management on slide 6.  \\nGWM’s pre -tax profit was 1.1 billion, an increase of over 80% as revenues grew by 10%.  Excluding litigation \\ncharges, PBT rose to 1.2 billion.  \\nNet new assets reached 18 billion and net new fee -generating assets were 13 billion, fueled by sales of \\nmandates and separately managed accounts.  Flow performance this quarter reflects the maturity of over 50 \\nbillion of fixed -term deposits associated with  our 2023 win -back campaign.  Like in previous quarters, we \\n \\n \\n Page 4 of 35 \\n \\n managed to retain over 85% on our platform, including converting over 20% into more profitable solutions, \\nincluding mandates.  \\nFor the full year 2024, we acquired net new assets of 97 billion, representing a 2.5% growth rate.  As I’ve \\nhighlighted in the past, our net new asset achievement this year reflects several challenges that we successfully \\nnavigated over the course of 2024.    \\nThis includes retaining the vast majority of Credit Suisse invested assets despite significant levels of relationship \\nmanager attrition, keeping the bulk of maturing fixed -term deposits as just mentioned in the context of 4Q, \\nand increasing profitability o n sub -hurdle lending relationships from our balance sheet optimization efforts.   \\nCollectively, while these factors weighed down flows by around 30 billion, importantly they’ve contributed to \\nenhanced profitability and returns.  This is evidenced by the 3 percentage point year -over-year increase in \\nrevenues over RWA.  \\nRecurring net fee income increased by 12% to 3.3 billion as our invested assets grew sequentially to 4.2 trillion, \\nabsorbing roughly 80 billion in FX headwinds.  Client traction with mandates remained strong with around 5 \\nbillion in net new mandates global ly, mainly driven by sales of our differentiated discretionary solutions and \\nsupported by continued momentum in SMAs in the US.   \\nMargins held up sequentially and are expected to remain around these levels, especially as recently migrated \\nclients and those remaining on the Credit Suisse platform now have access to the full breadth of our CIO value -\\nchain -led offering.  \\nThis quarter we once again demonstrated the benefits of combining our leading markets solutions and \\ncapabilities with our CIO’s investment calls.  This drove a 12% increase in transaction -based revenues in an \\nenvironment that saw broad re -risking after the  US elections.  \\nStructured products, equities, and alternatives all recorded double -digit transaction revenue increases.  Our \\ninvestments in capabilities, solutions, and unified teams support the durability of this revenue line and fuel our \\nability to capture wallet -share  in all climates.  \\nYear-on-year transaction revenue growth was led by APAC and the Americas, up by 30% and 13%, \\nrespectively.   \\nNet interest income at 1.7 billion was up 4% sequentially, reflecting improvements in both lending and deposit \\nmargins.  While fixed term deposit balances decreased in the quarter, we saw inflows into sweeps and current \\naccounts across our platform as our clients increased transactional balances in a constructive trading \\nenvironment.   \\nI would note that the planned sweep deposit pricing changes I mentioned previously went into effect for our \\nUS advisory accounts in early December.  Our 2025 outlook as a result of introducing these rate adjustments \\nremains unchanged.  \\nTurning to our NII outlook for GWM.  Since I offered an initial view on 2025 last quarter, we’ve seen a significant \\ndivergence in rates expectations between the US dollar, on the one hand, and the Swiss franc and Euro on the \\nother.  \\n \\n \\n Page 5 of 35 \\n \\n This distinction is important for GWM.  While our US business is effectively operated entirely in US dollars, in \\nGWM’s businesses outside the US, half of all deposits, and the majority of loans and low -beta transactional \\naccount balances, are denominated i n currencies other than the US dollar.  \\nLooking at the rates outlook, the Federal Reserve is now expected to cut US dollar rates more gradually.  \\nMeanwhile, both the Swiss and the European central banks are expected to continue to more actively cut.  \\nBased on this, in the first quarter, we expect to see headwinds from lower rates, particularly in the Swiss franc \\nand Euro, and lower balances from deployment of sweep and transactional account balances, partially offset \\nby higher margins from balance shee t optimization.  Combined with a lower day count effect, this is expected \\nto result in a low -to-mid single -digit-percentage sequential decrease in GWM’s NII.  \\nLooking further out, lower Swiss franc and Euro rates will remain a headwind to deposit margins, partially offset \\nby the benefits of continued balance sheet optimization, particularly on the deposit side. Net new loan growth \\nshould also help. I should note  that if we do see a more hawkish US dollar rates policy, while helpful to deposit \\nmargins, this is likely to moderate the extent of re -leveraging, particularly in Lombard lending.   \\nFor full year 2025 compared to 2024, we expect a low single digit percentage decrease in NII, inflecting by 2Q, \\nwith the second half of the year broadly flat versus 2H24.  \\nUnderlying operating expenses were unchanged from last year at 4.8 billion, with lower personnel and support \\ncosts offset by higher variable compensation tied to revenues and increased litigation provisions.  To offer a \\nlook-through comparison, excluding l itigation, variable compensation, FX, and last year’s FDIC special \\nassessment, costs were down 5% year -over-year.  \\nSlide 7 – Personal & Corporate Banking (CHF)  \\nTurning to Personal and Corporate Banking on slide 7.  \\nP&C delivered fourth quarter pre -tax profit of 572 million Swiss francs, down 18%, primarily from lower interest \\nrates affecting net interest income, down 8%, and elevated credit loss expense.   \\nRecurring net fee income increased by 8% driven by higher volumes of investment products and gross margin \\nexpansion.  Transaction -based revenues were up 13%, also on higher client activity.  \\nSequentially, NII decreased slightly by 1%.  We offset some of the effects of the SNB’s third 25 -basis point rate \\ncut from late September by moderately decreasing deposit rates and pricing loans to appropriately reflect risk \\nand capital costs.  \\nAfter the 50 basis point cut by the SNB in December there is a reasonable likelihood that we’ll see interest rates \\ndrop to zero by mid -2025.  \\nThe impact of near -zero rates will drive down deposit margins both sequentially and for the full year 2025.  \\nAdditional headwinds in 1Q are expected from the sequential day count effect and lower rates in US dollar and \\nEuro affecting deposit margins on tra nsactional accounts.   \\n \\n \\n Page 6 of 35 \\n \\n Hence, for P&C’s Swiss franc NII, we currently expect a roughly 10% sequential decline in the first quarter.  For \\nfull year 2025, the drop will be somewhat more pronounced versus 2024, with NII expected to trough in the \\nsecond quarter and plateau thereafte r.   \\nFrom there, any move in interest rates, whether negative or positive, should be constructive to our NII and net \\ninterest margin in P&C.  \\nCredit loss expense was 155 million Swiss francs, a 25 -basis point cost of risk on an average loan portfolio of \\n243 billion.  The quarterly result was driven by Stage 3 charges, predominantly from new -venture financings \\nand loans to corporates in the metal s and automotive industries, which have shown financial vulnerability in a \\nchallenging market environment across Europe.  \\nThese exposures, by and large, are on the Credit Suisse platform, reflecting lending practices and underwriting \\nstandards from the pre -acquisition period.   \\nWe expect CLE to remain elevated at around 350 million Swiss francs in 2025 as we continue to build allowances \\nfor pre -acquisition Credit Suisse portfolios, with many exposures still having more than a year until maturity.  In \\nthe first quarter, we may see  lower CLE versus the implied quarterly average due to seasonal factors.   \\nOperating expenses in P&C were 1.1 billion Swiss francs, up 2%, and flat sequentially, as the business offset \\nincreased investments in building up support functions related to its larger footprint through cost reduction \\ninitiatives and synergy realization.   \\nSlide 8 – Asset Management  \\nMoving to Asset Management, on slide 8.  Pre -tax profit increased by 20% to 224 million as strong cost \\ndiscipline more than offset lower revenues.   \\nOverall revenues were down 7%, or 6% excluding gains on asset sales.  \\nNet management fees declined by 5%, mainly from continuing shifts out of active equities compressing top -\\nline margins.   \\nPerformance fees were 44 million, compared to 52 million in the prior year quarter, with improvement in hedge \\nfund solutions more than offset by decreases across other products, including Fixed Income funds.  \\nNet new money in the quarter was positive 33 billion, led by a large institutional inflow in passive Equities and \\nnet flows into money market funds.  For the full -year 2024, net new money was 45 billion, a strong result in \\nlight of flow dis -synergies we we re expecting from integrating Credit Suisse Asset Management.  \\nOperating expenses were 15% lower, both year -over-year and sequentially, as the business is demonstrating \\ngood progress in transforming its operating model and driving cost saves.   \\nSlide 9 – Investment Bank  \\nOn to slide 9 and the Investment Bank.  Pre -tax profit of 452 million was driven by strong revenue performance, \\nup 37% year -on-year. \\n \\n \\n Page 7 of 35 \\n \\n Banking revenues increased by 19% to 675 million, with advisory, up 36%, and LCM, which more than doubled \\nits revenues, the main drivers of growth.  Regionally, we saw particular strength in the Americas, up 33%.  \\nMarkets revenues increased by 44% to 1.9 billion with increased client activity on higher cash volumes and \\nsupportive volatility across equities and FX.  This led to our best fourth quarter Markets revenue on record with \\nparticular strength in financing su pported by all -time-high client balances.  \\nFor Markets, regional revenues in the Americas and APAC surged by around 50%, and grew by about a third \\nin EMEA, driven by broad -based increases across both equities and FRC.  \\nOperating expenses were down 4% on lower personnel costs.   \\nSlide 10 – Non-core and Legacy  \\nOn slide 10, Non -core and Legacy’s pre -tax loss in the quarter was 606 million.  Revenues were negative 58 \\nmillion, mainly reflecting funding costs that, unlike in prior quarters, were not offset by gains on exits or the \\ncarry in our now much smaller credi t book.  \\nOperating expenses were down by nearly 50% year -on-year and 5% sequentially, as we continue to make \\ngood progress in driving out costs.  \\nNCL risk -weighted assets were 41 billion, down 3 billion sequentially, mainly from position exits.  LRD was down \\n15 billion, or 22% quarter -on-quarter.   \\nSlide 11 – A balance sheet for all seasons as a key pillar of our strategy  \\nTurning to our capital and balance sheet position on slide 11.  As of the end of the fourth quarter, our balance \\nsheet for all seasons consisted of 1.6 trillion in total assets, including around 600 billion in end -of-period loans \\nand 750 billion in end -of-period deposits.   \\nOur loan portfolio reflected credit -impaired exposures of 1%, up sequentially by 4 basis points.  The cost of risk \\nin the quarter increased to 15 basis points, as credit loss expense in our Swiss business drove this measure \\nhigher.  \\nWe ended the year with a sequentially unchanged CET1 capital ratio of 14.3%, as a decline in CET1 capital of \\n2.8 billion was offset by a proportionate decrease in risk weighted assets of 21 billion.  CET1 capital was mainly \\naffected by the stronger US doll ar as well as by higher cash taxes and dividend accruals, more than offsetting \\nquarterly profits.  RWA likewise was lower on currency effects as well as asset size reductions, mainly in the IB \\nand NCL.   \\nSlide 12 – Strong execution in 2024, delivering ahead of plan  \\nTo summarize, our fourth quarter performance caps off a strong 2024 in which our Non -core and Legacy team \\nsuccessfully ran down balance sheet and costs and our core franchises demonstrated strength and scale in \\ndelivering for our clients, even while absorb ing substantial costs associated with the integration.   \\nWith that, I hand back to Sergio for the investor update.   \\n \\n \\n Page 8 of 35 \\n \\n Sergio P. Ermotti  \\n \\nSlide 14: Executing on our proven strategy to deliver for all stakeholders  \\nThank you, Todd.  \\nFor over a decade, UBS has been a source of strength and stability for all of our stakeholders thanks to the \\nconsistent execution of our capital -generative strategy and a commitment to maintaining a balance sheet for \\nall seasons.  \\nOur global capabilities empower strong collaboration across our businesses to deliver the best of UBS to our \\nclients, and our disciplined focus on risk and efficiency is at the forefront of our culture.  This is why our clients \\ncontinue to extend their trust and confidence in UBS, and our employees are proud to work here. It is how we \\ngenerate significant value for our shareholders while remaining a consistent and reliable economic partner in \\nthe communities where we operate. And it has also allowed us to be a source of financial stability for \\nSwitzerland and the wider financial system in March of 2023.  \\nThe same principles guide us as we build an even stronger, safer and more efficient firm, and position UBS for \\nsustainably higher returns and long -term growth.  \\nSlide 15: Unique globally diversified model focused on asset gathering businesses  \\nOur unique business model, with our asset gathering businesses generating around 60% of our revenues, \\nprovides us with an attractive risk and return profile that continues to stand out among our global peers.  \\nWe are the largest truly global wealth manager, and the leading universal bank in Switzerland.  \\nThese two key pillars of our strategy are enhanced by a portfolio of best -in-class capabilities across Asset \\nManagement and our competitive, but capital -light Investment Bank.  \\nWith leading franchises in the world’s largest and fastest -growing markets, our regional diversification is a \\nstrategic advantage and also provides  us unique value for both our clients and investors.  \\nSlide 16: On track to substantially complete the integration by the end of 2026  \\nTurning to the integration.  \\nAs I highlighted earlier, we are on track with our plans thanks to the successful delivery of our key objectives in \\n2024, having completed over 4,000 milestones during the year.  \\nFollowing the merger of our Parent Banks, we have now migrated over 90% of client accounts outside of \\nSwitzerland onto UBS platforms. In addition, the integration of the Investment Bank is now complete, and in \\nAsset Management, we made good progress migrat ing portfolios onto our infrastructure and rationalizing our \\nfund shelf.  \\n \\n \\n Page 9 of 35 \\n \\n We also continue to follow our technology decommissioning roadmap. To date, we have removed over 40% \\nof Non -core and Legacy’s applications, worked through 16 petabytes of data and reduced the number of legacy \\nservers by over 40%.  \\nThanks to our restructuring efforts and the active wind -down of NCL, we have captured almost 60% of our \\ntargeted 13 billion gross cost savings.  \\nWe will look to maintain this momentum in 2025 as our focus shifts to migrating the majority of client accounts \\nin Switzerland, and decommissioning over twelve hundred Credit Suisse models and applications.  \\nWe have always said that our progress on the integration of Credit Suisse will not be a straight line. Our \\nperformance in 2025 will continue to reflect significant restructuring work necessary to integrate our businesses \\nand right -size our cost base.  \\nHaving said that, our progress to date supports an incremental improvement in our returns this year compared \\nto our previous guidance.  \\nWe remain confident in our ability to substantially complete the integration and deliver on our targets and \\nambitions by the end of 2026. At the same time, we will continue to invest to drive sustainable growth and \\nlong-term value beyond the integration.  \\nSlide 17: Continuing to invest in technology to drive business outcomes  \\n Investing in technology to benefit our clients and empower our colleagues is one of the key ways we are \\npreparing for the future.  \\nWe continue to invest in our best -in-class Cloud infrastructure with over 70% in the public and private Cloud. \\nThis is a key facilitator of our integration progress, allowing us to reduce complexity and costs as we remove \\nlegacy applications, while maintai ning our compliance and security standards.  \\nIt is also an important catalyst for innovation as we continue to invest in tools to enhance our client offering \\nand increase efficiency and effectiveness.  \\nA good example is our roll -out of 50,000 Microsoft Copilot licenses to our employees in the largest deployment \\nwithin the global financial services industry to date.  \\nWe are also seeing strong benefits from our proprietary generative A.I. solutions. One example is in the U.S., \\nwhere our advanced analytics platform supported our financial advisors with over 13 million automated insights \\nand actionable opportunities. Solu tions like this improve productivity and our ability to deliver tailored solutions \\nto our clients.  \\nSlide 18: On track to deliver on our cost and profitability ambitions in our core businesses  \\nWe are on track to deliver on our 2026 exit rate ambitions across our core businesses. While we are encouraged \\nby our progress to date, this slide also reflects the significant work that lies ahead to achieve our objectives.  \\n \\n \\n Page 10 of 35 \\n \\n In GWM, we remain focused on leveraging our enhanced capabilities and solutions to maintain client \\nmomentum. At the same time, we aim to capture the benefits of integration -related synergies and improve \\nadvisor productivity.  \\nWith the client account migrations achieved in APAC, we are even better placed to leverage our number -one \\nposition in the region to drive market -leading growth.  \\nIn the Americas, we are making targeted investments to deepen relationships with our ultra -high net worth \\nclients, accelerate growth in the high net worth and core affluent segments and expand our loan and deposit \\noffering.  \\nThese growth initiatives will be supported by actions we have already taken to enhance our technology offering, \\nsimplify our organizational structure and improve execution.  \\nI am confident in our ability to deliver mid -teen PBT margins as we exit 2026. Then, the business will be better \\npositioned to further expand profit margins and capture long -term growth. Todd will take you through our \\nplans in more detail.  \\nIn P&C, as we have said previously, declining Swiss franc rates are expected to continue to affect revenues. We \\nare still de -facto operating two separate banks, including branches, staff, and technology, but we are well \\npositioned to start delivering cost synergies later this year and into 2026 as we unite those platforms.  \\nUnfortunately, as we reported previously, this will lead to certain role reductions in Switzerland. We plan to \\nmitigate the impact of these as much as possible through natural attrition, early retirement and other measures.  \\nFor those impacted we will provide proactive support in helping to find a new job, and a comprehensive social \\nplan that combines the strongest components of the prior UBS and Credit Suisse plans. I am also especially \\nproud of efforts to prioritize the hiri ng of internal candidates: over two -thirds of open positions in Switzerland \\nwere filled this way in 2024.  \\nIn Asset Management, we remain focused on continuing to capture opportunities where we have a \\ndifferentiated and scalable offering.  \\nThis includes our newly launched Unified Global Alternatives unit, which makes us the fifth -largest Limited \\nPartner in Alternatives with promising growth prospects. At the same time, we will remain focused on realizing \\ncost synergies and structural efficie ncies to create capacity for investments and improve profitability.  \\nIn the Investment Bank, I am encouraged by the progress our fully integrated teams are making to deliver for \\nclients as we seize market share gains in our areas of strategic importance.  \\nAs we continue to deploy our products and services across our broader institutional client base and increase \\nconnectivity to GWM and P&C to deliver on our return ambitions, we will maintain our well -established risk \\nand capital discipline.  \\nSlide 19: Well placed to balance resiliency, growth and attractive capital returns  \\n Turning to capital.  \\n \\n \\n Page 11 of 35 \\n \\n We continue to target a CET1 capital ratio of around 14%. At this level, we will be able to go through the \\nintegration period and beyond with a strong capital buffer relative to minimum requirements.  This will allow us \\nto remain a source of stability while we self -fund growth and deliver attractive capital returns to our \\nshareholders.  \\nFor the 2025 financial year, we plan to accrue for an increase in our dividend of around 10 percent. We also \\nplan to repurchase another 1 billion dollars of shares in the first half of this year, and up to an additional 2 \\nbillion in the second half. As in the past, our share repurchases will be consistent with delivering on our financial \\nplans and maintaining our CET1 capital ratio target of around 14%, and assuming no material, immediate \\nchanges to the current capital regime.  \\nOur ambition for capital returns to exceed pre -acquisition levels in 2026 remains unchanged.  \\nNow, following the publication of the Parliamentary Investigation Commission’s report in December, we expect \\nfurther developments in the ongoing review of the capital regime in Switzerland. Based on the latest public \\ncommunication from the State Secretariat for International Finance, the public consultation on the proposal is \\nexpected to begin in May. Therefore, at this time, we are not in a position to offer any new information.   \\nAs we have said in the past, we support the vast majority of proposals from the Swiss Federal Council on how \\nto enhance the regulatory framework in Switzerland. In our discussions with Swiss authorities, we continue to \\nmaintain our view that the Swiss capital regime is one of the strongest when consistently and coherently \\napplied. While it is also crystal clear that the overall quality of our capital is of a much higher standard than \\nCredit Suisse’s, we accept that some adjustments and clarifications to the current regime may be necessary.  \\nHowever, a disproportionate outcome in terms of requirements at the Parent Bank level would drive our capital \\nat the Group level to overshoot the current requirements. Therefore, we believe that any significant change is \\nunjustified.  Offsetting the consequences of higher requirements would make us uncompetitive domestically \\nand abroad, hamper our ability to help clients grow and, importantly, make banking services more expensive \\nfor Swiss families and enterprises in the long run. It will also damage the nation’s standing as an attractive \\nglobal financial center and ultimately hurt our position as the third -largest private employer in Switzerland.  \\nOf course, this would have an impact on our returns on capital. But even more importantly it would impede \\nour ability to compete for capital in the global marketplace, particularly in a moment of financial stress. As a \\nreminder, our current ambitions are b ased on a 14% CET1 capital ratio.  \\nI’ve been reading some recent reports. So, let me be very clear. There are no easy fixes in terms of repatriation \\nof capital from foreign subsidiaries or balance sheet optimization that are not already included in our plans.  \\nTherefore, while I am extremely confident in our capital generation capacity under any outcome, our \\nshareholder returns and returns on capital would be affected. Todd will provide more detail later.  \\nWe want to continue to be a source of strength for our clients, employees, shareholders and Switzerland.  \\nFor that reason, it is very important that a comprehensive cost/benefit analysis on the consequences of any \\nmaterial changes of capital requirements is carried out. We remain hopeful that any potential changes will be \\nproportionate, targeted, internationally aligned and coherent with the strategic objectives set out by the Swiss \\nFederal Council.  \\n \\n \\n Page 12 of 35 \\n \\n Slide 20: Rebuilding profitability and positioning for sustainable growth post -integration  \\nAs I mentioned before, we have substantially de -risked the integration across many dimensions.  \\nThis is reflected in our return profile, which has significantly improved compared to a year ago.  \\nOur goal is to continue to rebuild profitability in 2025 as we further progress our integration plan and capture \\nthe benefits of our enhanced scale and capabilities across our businesses.  \\nWe remain well positioned to deliver on our 15% return on CET1 capital target by the end 2026. We will then \\nlook to achieve UBS’s pre -acquisition levels of profitability and deliver on our 2028 ambitions.  \\nWe have achieved so much over the last two years, and I am proud of the immense effort of all of my colleagues.  \\nBut there is no room for complacency, and we remain focused on serving our clients, delivering on the next \\nphase of the integration and fulfilling our growth initiatives as we position UBS for a successful future.  \\nWith that, I hand back to Todd for more details on our plans.    \\n \\n \\n Page 13 of 35 \\n \\n Todd Tuckner  \\n \\nSlide 21 – Growth in core business profitability to drive returns  \\nThanks again, Sergio. I will now offer a more detailed perspective on our financial outlook for 2025 and the \\ntrajectory towards our exit -2026 targets and ambitions, starting on slide 21.  \\nWith each of our core businesses well positioned to drive sustainable growth, in 2025 we expect to generate \\nan underlying return on CET1 capital of around 10% versus 8.7% in 2024. This year -on-year increase reflects \\nour expectation that Non -core and Legacy  will weigh on our financial performance more significantly than last \\nyear.  \\nImportantly, this also means that our core businesses are expected to be the main drivers of year -on-year growth \\nin returns despite continuing to absorb, together with NCL, the costs associated with restructuring and \\nintegrating the businesses, legal entit ies, infrastructure and teams inherited with the acquisition.  \\nFor full -year 2025, we expect an effective tax rate of around 20%, as we aim to implement tax planning later \\nin the year, mainly related to the combination of legal entities in the US.  \\nThe acceleration we expect in 2026, when our in -year return on CET1 should be low teens and our exit -rate \\naround 15%, will be driven predominantly by the benefits from more than three years of extensive integration, \\nrestructuring and transformation effort.   \\nAs I’ve highlighted in the past, we continue to expect more significant cost reductions across the core businesses \\nas we retire legacy infrastructure and create further staff capacity.  \\nRevenues should also receive an uplift as we complete the integration and play more on our front foot with no \\ndistractions, generating alpha across our core franchises.  \\nMoreover, most of the headwinds to returns we see in 2025 are expected to dissipate by the end of 2026. \\nThese include NII and credit loss expenses in Switzerland, with the latter, starting next year, expected to reflect \\na substantial conversion towards P&C ’s historical average cost of risk as a result of increased allowances and \\nlegacy Credit Suisse loan maturities.  \\nAdditionally, as we exit 2026, we expect to see better profitability in our US wealth business, and further \\nreductions to our Non -core and Legacy portfolio, decreasing its drag on resources and profits.  \\nAs I’ve mentioned before, the plans underpinning our ambitions are largely determined by factors within our \\ncontrol.  While we expect to continue to invest for growth, we retain the necessary optionality and operating \\nflexibility to support our profitabili ty and returns ambitions, regardless of market conditions.   \\nSlide 22 – Achieved 58% of gross cost saves ambition, on track to ~13bn by year -end 2026  \\nTurning to costs on Slide 22. As of year -end, we‘ve delivered 7.5 billion of cumulative gross run -rate cost saves, \\nof which 3.4 billion in 2024, putting us well on track towards achieving our goal of around 13 billion by the \\nend of 2026.  \\n \\n \\n Page 14 of 35 \\n \\n Of the cumulative gross saves achieved to date, 4 billion contributed to net cost reductions, with much of this \\nprogress driven by NCL.  \\nImportantly, while the overall cost base decreased by 10% from its 2022 base line, if we exclude litigation and \\nvariable compensation linked to revenues, we delivered a 17% net reduction in underlying expenses on this \\nlook-through basis.  \\nLooking out over the next two years, we expect around 5 and a half billion of additional gross cost saves across \\ntechnology, third party spend, real estate and from unlocking additional staff capacity.  \\nAs we’ve highlighted previously, while we remain continuously focused on driving cost savings by reducing \\nduplication and streamlining wherever possible, we do not expect our sequential cost reduction to be linear.  \\nThe impact on our cost base varies each quarter, depending on the timing of large -scale integration initiatives \\nthat drive efficiencies across infrastructure, real estate and workforce optimization.  \\nOver the next two years, the most meaningful driver of cost reductions will be the decommissioning of legacy \\ninfrastructure, with the most prominent example the retirement of the Swiss platform, which will only happen \\nafter the client account migration is finalized next year.  \\nAt that point, we’ll decommission the associated hardware, data centers and software applications, including \\nsystems in the middle and back office that are linked to client facing platforms.  \\nThe continued run -down of NCL and further rationalization of our real estate footprint and legal entity structure \\nwill also support our realizing cost synergies over the next two years as we work towards our exit -2026 \\ncost/income ratio target of less than 70%.  \\nMoreover, with almost 60% of our gross cost save ambition achieved through the end of 2024, we now have \\na clearer line of sight as to the costs to achieve the successful completion of our integration plans.  \\nWe now expect cumulative integration -related expenses to total around 14 billion. The 1 billion in incremental \\nspend largely compensates for lower -than-anticipated staff attrition levels and accelerated real estate exits. It \\nalso accounts for investments i n new opportunities to unlock long -term value creation in connection with select \\nCredit Suisse businesses.   \\nSlide 23 – GWM – Unrivaled scale with interconnected global franchises  \\nTurning to our business divisions and starting with Global Wealth Management, on slide 23.  \\nWith over 4 trillion in invested assets, our scale, global connectivity, innovation and CIO -led advice and solutions \\nuniquely position us to capture wallet and seize growth opportunities across our global footprint.  \\nGWM Americas, which comprises our US, Canada and Latin America wealth businesses is a leading wealth \\nmanagement provider, with 2.1 trillion of assets served by nearly 6 thousand financial advisors.  \\nIn Switzerland and EMEA, we’re the number one player, combining our global offering with regional \\nadaptations and client proximity.  \\n \\n \\n Page 15 of 35 \\n \\n And, in APAC, with a broad and well -diversified footprint, we’re the number one wealth manager, twice as \\nlarge as our next closest competitor.   \\nSlide 24 – GWM – Capitalizing on integration and growing the platform  \\nMoving to slide 24. In 2024, GWM recorded an underlying pre -tax profit of almost 5 billion and an underlying \\ncost/income ratio of 80%, while restoring its capital efficiency to levels similar to those before the acquisition.  \\nIn 2025, returns are expected to grow year -over-year as we continue to capitalize on our enduring competitive \\nadvantages, underpinned by secular tailwinds.  \\nThe industry trends we see accelerating across our global family, ultra and high net worth client segments, \\nincluding legacy and longevity -based planning needs, geographic wealth migration and multi -disciplinary client \\nsolutions, play right to our strength s. We expect these dynamics to drive revenue growth in 2025.  \\nMoreover, our teams of advisors, investment managers and solution specialists are leveraging our client account \\nmigration efforts as a unique opportunity to review and rebalance client portfolios, while supporting our clients \\nduring their transition to the  UBS platform. This work supports our outlook of continued, increasing mandate \\npenetration and gross margin stability.  \\nAlso, GWM’s costs are expected to decrease over the course of 2025, principally as we decommission platforms \\nfollowing the first wave of client account migration work completed last year.  \\nAs in 2024, GWM’s net new asset ambition will continue to reflect the actions and other dynamics I’ve \\nhighlighted that support higher pre -tax margins and returns on attributed equity, but, at times, come at the \\nexpense of flows.  \\nWhile in Switzerland, EMEA and APAC, the impact on flows is expected to soften over the course of the year, \\nin the US, our efforts to align financial advisor incentives with our strategic priorities may result in a short -term \\nincrease in FA attrition, crea ting an additional headwind for net new assets in the coming months. We therefore \\nmaintain our net new asset ambition of around 100 billion for 2025.  \\nYet, in 2026, with the integration behind us, and flow headwinds fully addressed, we expect GWM net new \\nassets to begin to accelerate towards our ambition of 200 billion per annum and over 5 trillion in invested assets \\nby 2028.  \\nMoreover, the improvement in ECM activity we’re starting to observe across the globe should ultimately play \\nto our asset -gathering strengths. This coincides with increasing levels of monetization among wealth \\nmanagement clients, which is expected to transl ate into greater opportunities to intensify engagement, capture \\nshare of wallet, and deliver advice and solutions.   \\nSlide 25 – GWM Americas – Strong franchise with upside on profitability  \\nMoving to the Americas on slide 25.  \\nOur Americas wealth business, our foothold into the world’s largest wealth pool, is a key pillar of our long -term \\ngrowth strategy and value proposition to clients.  \\n \\n \\n Page 16 of 35 \\n \\n In addition to accounting for around 50% of our total asset base, it also contributes a similar proportion to \\nGWM’s global revenues. Given the strategic importance of the Americas business, we recognize that improving \\nits financial performance is both a ne cessity and a priority.  \\nSince 2019, we’ve grown the region’s invested assets and revenues at a CAGR of 8% and 4%, respectively, \\nand delivered profit margins averaging mid -teens. After reaching a record pre -tax margin of 19% in 2021, \\nwe’ve seen profitability retreat to its current  level of around 10%.  \\nWhile our revenues have grown, expenses have grown faster.  \\nWith a business model mostly geared towards the most financially sophisticated ultra and family clients, the \\npost-pandemic market dynamics of rising equity prices and soaring interest rates caused a shift in our revenue \\nmix that drove up variable compensat ion levels and compressed profit margins.  \\nAt the same time, technology costs were increasing as part of our efforts to improve and modernize the digital \\nexperience for our clients and advisors, but also to address past investments in large programs where delivery \\nhad been suboptimal. On top of thi s, the cost of recruiting advisors, back office spend and litigation charges all \\ngrew.  \\nTo address these challenges, we’re changing how we operate to improve profitability and position the business \\nfor more efficient and sustainable growth.  \\nSince the end of last year, we’ve already taken actions to streamline our organizational structure, improve cost \\ndiscipline and align the incentives of our financial advisors to our strategic objectives. As these changes take \\nhold, and given our intention to fund incremental strategic investments, we expect our pre -tax margin in 2025 \\nto remain at broadly current levels. We then expect to make more material progress and steadily improve \\ntowards mid -teens by  2027.  \\nAt that point, the business will be better positioned to further expand its profitability and help the global wealth \\nfranchise deliver beyond its end -2026 target of a greater than 30% underlying pre -tax margin.  \\nLet me highlight the key changes we’re implementing on slide 26.   \\nSlide 26 –  GWM Americas – Working to deliver ~15% PBT margin by 2027 (1/2)  \\nFirst, on service models. Our strong track record in serving sophisticated clients demonstrates the effectiveness \\nof close collaboration across the organization. This is clearly reflected in the 21% year -over-year increase in \\nAmericas’ transactional revenues after we introduced joint coverage of GWM clients with IB markets specialists.  \\nMoreover, our experience tells us that the use of one or more of our specialized capabilities has a meaningful \\nmultiplier effect on revenue generation. We’re building a regionally -aligned, multi -disciplinary team approach, \\nand extending this offering to a broader population of our existing ultra -high net worth clients to accelerate \\nrevenue growth. We’re rolling out this set -up immediately, and scaling it over the course of 2025.  \\nSecond, on client mix. Going forward we intend to better balance our client base across wealth bands by \\nincreasing investment and penetration in the high net worth and core affluent segments to drive scale and \\nprofitability.  \\n \\n \\n Page 17 of 35 \\n \\n To that end, we’re streamlining and automating product and content distribution and developing more tailored \\nsegment -specific solutions, leveraging our CIO and National Sales capabilities.  \\nIn addition, we’re investing in our digitally -led advice model in the Wealth Advice Center to make it a more \\nmeaningful contributor to organic growth and to lower our cost to serve. By more than doubling our Advice \\nCenter staff, we aim to create further ca pacity to acquire and serve more clients and increase wallet with existing \\nones. In addition, the Wealth Advice Center becomes an effective pipeline for future FAs and a more cost -\\nefficient way to scale our business.  \\nAnother key aspect of our rebalancing efforts relates to enhancing our feeder channels. We intend to expand \\nsources of asset acquisition by revising our referral and incentive structures while centralizing and investing in \\ndigital marketing. We’re also dev eloping a comprehensive, integrated workplace wealth solution across equity \\nand retirement plans, and financial planning and wellness. We believe a signature workplace wealth offering \\nwith state -of-the-art digital capabilities will serve as a highly effect ive client -lead generator, aligning with our \\npriority to improve penetration across wealth bands.    \\nThird. On the capabilities side, we’re taking critical steps to build out a full suite of banking capabilities to \\nenhance our ability to serve our clients and their business interests. This will help us expand our access to \\ndeposits, better balance our rev enue mix, deepen client relationships, and, importantly, foster enduring \\nengagement and connectivity between our clients and UBS.  \\nExpanding and enhancing our banking product offering requires that we obtain a National Charter, a multi -\\nyear process that is presently in full swing.   \\nSlide 27 –  GWM Americas – Working to deliver ~15% PBT margin by 2027 (2/2)  \\nNow moving to slide 27.  \\nUnderpinning these initiatives and their success is a necessary operational re -alignment of the structure, \\nperformance culture and tech strategy in our Americas wealth franchise.  \\nSo, fourth, effective January first, we simplified the organizational structure to drive greater collaboration, \\nreduce duplication and create synergies, thereby contributing to improved productivity and efficiency. This \\nincludes regionally aligning our cli ent-facing teams, reducing management layers and fostering clear \\naccountability and faster decision -making.  \\nRecently, we also announced changes to our financial advisor compensation model. We aim to better align FA \\nincentives with the strategic goals of the firm by rewarding net new money, new client acquisition and the \\nbroadening of existing client relationship s, with a specific incentive for NII growth.  \\nWhile we designed these changes to incentivize greater production and ultimately higher compensation levels \\nfor advisors in full sync with our strategy, we may see a short -term rise in FA attrition, which is reflected in our \\npre-tax margin expectation for 2025.  \\nAnd finally, we’re implementing a strategic re -set in terms of how we invest and modernize our technology \\ninfrastructure. We’re now delivering new and advanced digital capabilities in a dynamic, modular fashion that \\nmake it easier for our clients and advis ors to do business with, and on behalf of, UBS.  \\n \\n \\n Page 18 of 35 \\n \\n This approach will enable more efficient execution of our technology roadmap with improved payback, which, \\ntogether with an expanded tech budget, will create additional capacity to fund innovative solutions to improve \\nadvisor productivity and drive growth.  \\nWe believe these actions, which are being decisively executed by our new leadership team, will drive margins \\nto a mid -teens level by 2027, while positioning the Americas wealth business for long -term growth.  \\nA final word on providing more visibility to track our performance going forward. While the ultimate measure \\nof our progress in the Americas is improvement in our regional pre -tax margin, beginning in 1Q, we’ll enhance \\nour regional disclosure by breaking o ut revenue across the various categories and including prior period \\ncomparatives.  \\nSlide 28 – P&C – A core pillar of our strategy and reliable partner to the Swiss economy  \\nTurning to slide 26 and onto our Swiss business. As the leading bank for corporate and private clients in the \\ncountry, our Swiss universal bank, with P&C at its core, showcases the power of close collaboration, creating \\nvalue for clients.  \\nEven while absorbing NII and CLE headwinds, optimizing its balance sheet, and preparing for the client account \\nmigration, P&C alone contributed over one third of the Group’s 2024 underlying pre -tax profits.   \\nAs we expect the headwinds I highlighted earlier to weigh on P&C’s returns in 2025, we aim to partially mitigate \\nthe effects of these challenges by growing non -NII revenues, while also striving to minimize client and asset \\noutflows during the migration pro cess. \\nMoreover, the completion of the client account migration work will allow us to realize cost synergies and further \\ninvest in digital capabilities improving the client experience and efficiency of our platform.  \\nBy 2026, we intend to fully capitalize on growth opportunities with no distractions. Our Swiss business will be \\nuniquely positioned to offer exceptional value throughout the client lifecycle by delivering a comprehensive \\nsuite of services spanning wealth m anagement, asset management and investment banking.  \\nOur primary focus will be on reinforcing our standing as the go -to bank for large corporates, entrepreneurs and \\nemerging affluent clients with leading financing, asset servicing and wealth advice capabilities.  \\nThis positioning, coupled with a more streamlined cost base, give us confidence in our ability to grow the P&C \\nbusiness at least as fast as Swiss GDP, while delivering a cost/income ratio of less than 50% and a pre -tax return \\non equity of near 20% by the e nd of 2026.  \\n  \\nSlide 29 –  AM – Driving focused growth and improving operating leverage  \\nI now turn to Asset Management on slide 29.  \\nOur strategic positioning, expanded product offering and enhanced regional scale in select markets are already \\nsupporting healthy momentum in Asset Management. Despite the impact of the integration, we saw 45 billion \\n \\n \\n Page 19 of 35 \\n \\n in net new money enter our platform in 2024 while we remain focused on continuing to capture opportunities \\nwhere we have a differentiated and scalable offering.  \\nThis includes our recently launched Unified Global Alternatives unit, which, with nearly 300 billion in invested \\nassets, makes us a leading global player and top -5 limited partner. By combining our leading manager selection \\nfranchises across GWM and Asset Management, we can now offer our wealth management and institutional \\nclients access to exclusive investment opportunities, while providing GPs with a single point of access to the full \\ndistribution power of UBS.  \\nOverall, with a focus on alternatives, improved traditional investment performance and customized client \\nsolutions at scale, we continue to expect positive net new money growth in 2025 while completing our fund \\nshelf transition and platform consolidation.  \\nAt the same time, we’re investing in our existing platform to build -out key capabilities, create cost efficiencies \\nand support our AI strategy.  \\nWe’ll also remain focused on realizing cost synergies from the integration and driving structural operational \\nefficiencies from our strategic cost program. Together with further exits of non -strategic businesses, these \\nefforts are expected to improve our p rofit margin in Asset Management to above 30% by the end of 2026.   \\nSlide 30 – IB - Integration complete, unlocking opportunities for long -term value  \\nNow moving to the Investment Bank, on slide 30.  \\nOver the last twelve months, we’ve generated more than half a billion of incremental underlying revenue in \\nGlobal Banking and delivered record performance in Global Markets, including reaching record market share \\nin Cash Equities.  \\nLooking forward, with favorable market conditions, the completion of the Credit Suisse integration, and earlier \\ninvestments starting to pay off, we aim to enhance our IB’s returns in 2025.  \\nIn Banking, we remain encouraged by our pipeline in M&A and LCM and our improved position in the Americas, \\nwhich together are expected to support year -on-year revenue growth in 2025.  \\nI should note that, while there continues to be broad -based positive sentiment around the market backdrop, \\nglobal fee pools in January were off by more than 20% year -on-year.  Additionally, despite greater market \\nactivity in equity capital markets, product ivity improvement visible in our own ECM business is more likely to \\nyield meaningful revenue growth later in 2025 and into 2026, considering the timeline of our pipeline build.  \\nThis said, with market share in the Americas over two times pre -acquisition levels, we remain confident in our \\nability to double Banking revenues in 2026 compared to our 2022 baseline.  \\nIt’s also worth highlighting that our Investment Bank will be the only major player in the US and Europe \\nimplementing final Basel III regulations, and in particular FRTB. Upholding our capital -light business model \\ndespite this additional cost of capital, t he IB remains committed to achieve its pre -tax return on equity ambition \\nof 15% through the cycle while continuing to consume no more than 25% of the Group’s risk weighted assets.   \\n \\n \\n Page 20 of 35 \\n \\n Slide 31 –  NCL – Run-down well ahead of schedule  \\nTurning to Non -core and Legacy on slide 31.  \\nThe performance delivered by the Non -core and Legacy team in 2024 contributed to a significant acceleration \\nin our de -risking, cost saving and capital release plans.  \\nIn particular, what we achieved during the last 6 quarters has fundamentally altered NCL’s  balance sheet and \\nrisk position entering 2025, with RWA from its Credit, Securitized Products, Equities and Macro books reduced \\nby over 70%.  \\nIn addition to now being much smaller, and yielding less net carry, these books are broadly hedged against \\nmarket moves, thereby effectively mitigating risks but also limiting revenue upside.  \\nAdditionally, a significant portion of the funding costs associated with the overall portfolio relates to long -dated \\nHoldco and Opco debt that Credit Suisse issued during its crisis. These instruments are prohibitively expensive \\nto redeem prior to maturity , making them a sticky component of NCL’s costs, irrespective of funding needs.  \\nAs a result, for full year 2025, we estimate NCL’s top line at around negative 500 million, mainly from funding \\ncosts, with revenues from remaining fair value positions and continued exits expected around zero. Excluded \\nfrom this estimate is a gain of arou nd 100 million expected in the first quarter from closing the sale of Credit \\nSuisse’s US mortgage servicing company that we announced last year.  \\nWe also anticipate NCL’s underlying operating expenses ex -litigation to continue to reduce over the course of \\n2025, averaging around 450 million per quarter.  \\nAccordingly, in 2025, NCL’s underlying pre -tax loss excluding litigation is expected to be around 2.2 billion, \\nalbeit with sequential improvements as expenses and consumption -based funding costs decrease.  \\nThis compares to an underlying pre -tax loss in 2024 of around 800 million, inclusive of litigation releases. 2024’s \\nperformance benefitted from net carry income and our exiting positions at prices above book value, neither of \\nwhich is expected to repeat at  similar levels. Consequently, in 2025, NCL is expected to substantially weigh on \\nreturns year -over-year.  \\nLooking further out, we expect NCL to exit 2026 with less than 5% of Group RWA, consisting of less than 10 \\nbillion of market and credit risk. We also expect to exit 2026 with pre -tax loss of under 1 billion as the business \\ncontinues its strong cost reducti on trajectory. This is anticipated to consist of annualized operating expenses of \\naround 750 million and annualized net funding costs of around 200 million.  \\nWe then intend to run down NCL’s legacy operating expenses to a level below 250 million by the end of 2028 \\nwith funding costs tapering over an extended timeframe as legacy Credit Suisse funding matures. By the end \\nof 2028, we forecast around 100 million of  legacy funding costs per annum, fully running down by 2033.  \\nOur outlook for the run -off of NCL’s operational risk RWA for now remains in line with the trajectory we \\nmodeled under our internal method and disclosed previously. This reflects the fact that, unlike what is expected \\nto eventually apply in the US, UK and across Europe, the 2025 Swiss implementation of the standardized \\n \\n \\n Page 21 of 35 \\n \\n approach imposes an internal loss multiplier well above 1, thereby resulting in significant RWA primarily for \\nlosses and matters we inherited from Credit Suisse.    \\nSlide 32 – Disciplined management of capital, liquidity and funding  \\nPicking up on my earlier comments, slide 32 showcases our strong financial position at year -end 2024 and \\nrelated regulatory measures. Our balance sheet for all seasons underpins our ability to consistently deliver for \\nour clients and shareholders, while we  ourselves maintain resilience through disciplined risk management and \\nstrong capital and liquidity levels.  \\nAt the end of 2024, our Group total loss -absorbing capacity stood at 185 billion, with a going concern capital \\nratio of 17.6%, and, as mentioned, a CET1 capital ratio of 14.3%.  \\nWe closed 2024 with AT1 capital at 3.3% of RWA. During the year, we successfully issued 3.5 billion in AT1 as \\nwe build towards our ambition and regulatory allowance of 4.3% of RWA. Given our progress to date and \\nbased on our projected 2025 funding needs, w e expect our AT1 capital to remain at current levels through \\n2025 with new issuance offsetting potential calls.  \\nGone -concern capital at year -end was 98 billion. As a reminder, while this is around 40 billion above the Group \\nregulatory minimum, our binding constraint is UBS AG’s standalone requirement. Looking ahead, we’re \\ntargeting to bring down Group HoldCo to arou nd 90 billion by the end of 2025 while still retaining resilient \\nbuffers over regulatory minimums. This target, which is expected to contribute substantial savings in funding \\ncosts, is based on the expectation that UBS AG standalone requirements will decre ase as a result of further \\nbalance sheet reductions and the reorganization of remaining former Credit Suisse operating companies.  \\nUBS AG’s standalone CET1 capital ratio at year -end is estimated to be 13.5%. For the foreseeable future, we \\nexpect UBS AG to operate with a standalone CET1 capital ratio in the range of 12.5% to 13%, around 2 and \\na half points above the current regulatory minimum on a fully applied basis.  \\nThis guidance factors in the effects of our ongoing integration efforts and also considers the prospect of settling \\nCredit Suisse legacy litigation matters that could result in charges to the parent bank despite coverage at the \\nGroup level from PPA reserve s established on the acquisition date. This target capital level also accounts for \\nplanned dividends and capital from subsidiaries.  \\nDuring the fourth quarter, 13 billion of capital was repatriated to the parent bank from its subsidiaries in the \\nUK and the US.  \\nOf the total, 6 billion was paid up from UBS Americas Holding. The UK subsidiary, Credit Suisse International, \\nrepatriated 7 billion, with around 5 billion of additional distributions expected as we continue to unwind or \\ntransfer its positions, subject to customary regulatory approval.  \\nAs Sergio mentioned, it’s important to note that we’ve planned for this distribution of capital from subsidiaries \\nsince the acquisition. As such, it forms part of our capital return ambitions while maintaining our target capital \\nratios at both the Group le vel and the parent bank.  \\n \\n \\n Page 22 of 35 \\n \\n Therefore, broadly speaking, new capital requirements from Too Big To Fail imposed at the parent bank level \\nwould need to be funded by a higher retention of profits, consequently leading to an overshooting of capital \\nat the Group level and resulting in a l ower overall return on CET1 capital, all other things being equal.  \\nOn to liquidity and funding. As we aim to balance efficiency with resiliency and safety, over the past 18 months, \\nwe’ve been maintaining our LCR above pre -acquisition levels. This approach was necessary to facilitate the \\nphase -in of the more stringent Swis s liquidity requirements, which has now been completed, and to sustain a \\nconservative liquidity profile during the initial stages of our balance sheet stabilization and integration process.  \\nGoing forward, we expect to operate with an LCR below our 4Q24 level of 188%, reflecting continued efforts \\nto manage towards a more efficient funding structure and reduced uncertainties associated with execution risk.  \\nOverall, our current funding strategy focuses on enhancing the quality of our liability portfolios while delivering \\ncost efficiencies. This involves the right -sizing of our AT1 and TLAC stacks, disciplined deposit pricing, and active \\nmanagement of our liab ilities across tenors and products to ensure a robust, diversified, and resilient funding \\nprofile. Coupled with significant balance sheet reductions achieved in 2024 and tighter spreads, these measures \\nhave already generated annual funding cost savings of 650 million, with an additional 350 million expected by \\n2026.   \\nSlide 33 – Balance sheet optimization funds profitable growth  \\nTurning to slide 33 on RWA and starting with an update on the implementation of the final Basel III reforms, \\nwhich in Switzerland took effect on January 1st.  \\nWe intend to report a day -1 impact of around 1 billion of incremental RWA, broadly neutral to our CET1 capital \\nratio, a result reflective of many months of intense, diligent preparation. This amount of RWA includes increases \\nrelated to FRTB of 9 billion, d ecreases from credit -risk related adjustments of 1 billion, and a reduction in \\noperational risk of 7 billion.  \\nLooking at our expectations through 2026. Over the next two years, we expect our Group RWA to increase by \\naround 2 percent at constant FX from our 1 January 2025 pro -forma levels. This reflects around 15 billion higher \\nRWA from business growth in the core businesses, with the offset driven by the ongoing run -off in NCL.  \\nSumming this up, we get to the same expected RWA level at the end of 2026 as we guided a year ago. However, \\nwith faster NCL reductions than foreseen, a lower than expected headwind from Basel III finalization, and \\naccelerated benefits from our balance shee t optimization efforts, we increased capacity to support additional \\nRWA growth in our core businesses to drive incremental revenues.   \\nSlide 34 – Reiterating our financial targets and long -term ambitions  \\nIn conclusion, we’re pleased with the progress and achievement made in 2024. And as we move forward, we’re \\nconfident in our ability to successfully deliver on our integration plans, meet our financial targets and drive long -\\nterm value creation for our shar eholders.  \\nWith that, let’s open up for questions.  \\n \\n \\n Page 23 of 35 \\n \\n Analyst Q&A (CEO and CFO)  \\n \\nChris Hallam , Goldman Sach s \\nYeah. Good morning, everybody. So on integration, on the one hand, you  ran ahead of plan in 2024 , \\nclearly , the RoCET1 has ended up much better than expected , but on the other hand, you're also guiding to \\naround an extra  1 billion in cumulative integration cost by year end 2026 with an unchanged exit rate on \\nreturns. So , I guess , to what extent can we characterize this? Is it essentially the easy part of the integration \\nhas now come to an end and now the hard work on decommissioning and data integration begins, i.e., \\nhave we seen, have we sort of front loaded the integration tailwinds or is there still scope to outperform \\nhere over the next couple of years?  \\nAnd then second , on capital, you have the caveats on the buyback target that this is on the basis of no \\nmaterial and immediate change in the current capital regime. What's your assessment of the likelihood that \\nsuch changes could be both material and immediate , versus the potential for them being material, but with \\na long phase in or smaller than expected, but with immediate applicability? And what is your best sense on \\nwhen we might get final clarity and resolution on this topic? Sergio, I think you mentioned earlier that the \\npublic consultation begins in May. Thank you.  \\nSergio  P. Ermotti  \\nLet me pick up the second question and then I'll pass it to Todd. So , I think in terms of, you know, the \\ncaveating on our capital returns is quite consistent with previous language. You know, being, you know, \\nstaying at 14%, delivering on our financial plans, but also reducing the risk of the execution of the \\nintegration. S o in that sense, you know, I just want to remind that the massive migration of data we're \\ngoing to go through in 2025 creates potential operational risk. So we have to be prudent about how we \\nalso look at share buybacks. Having said that, I'm still confident that we will be able to do that.  \\nNow, you know, I have no more visibility than you have in respect of how things are going to develop other \\nthan what is publicly presented. I have, you know, I can continue to say that it is for us not appropriate to \\nspeculate on any outcome. And, you know , so we will engage till the last minutes to make sure that \\nwhatever proposal is put on the place is reflecting of the concerns and topics that I raised in my remarks.  \\nTodd  Tuckner  \\nAnd Chris, on the first one, just to point out a few things that no, it's not – the change is not reflective of \\nwhat we consider to be more, more complex versus less complex. Important to note that, you know, when \\nwe developed this view a year back, this w as seen as a very low multiplier when you look at 13 billion of \\ncost to achieve versus the gross cost saves that we anticipated. And we're still even with 14 billion at a very \\nlow multiplier.  \\nAnd so it should be seen in that light, but it's important to highlight that the changes were invited by \\ncertain assumptions we modeled a year ago and we saw changes which I highlighted in my comments \\nearlier. But also importantly, we've identified increme ntal opportunities as we've worked through the \\nintegration to unlock additional shareholder value, and that's taken some incremental cost to achieve that.  \\n \\n \\n Page 24 of 35 \\n \\n Chris Hallam , Goldman Sach s \\nOkay. Thanks very much.  \\n \\nAnke Reingen , RBC \\nSorry. Yeah. Thank you much for taking my question. Two questions, please. On the first one coming back \\nto the too big to fail was, I mean, you stressed a few times the potential impact on your return currently, on \\nyour current assumptions based on 14%. I know there's a lot of uncertainty, but do you think considering \\ndepending on the outcome, you will have room to offset your ROE dilution for more capital requirements? \\nAnd then thank you on the US wealth management operation, a few details here. I'm jus t wondering \\nobviously you talked about improving the performance of the US operations a few times before. So what \\nwill be  different this time that this will work out? Thank you very much.  \\nSergio  P. Ermotti  \\nThank you, Anke. Unfortunately, as I mentioned before, there is no easy fixes and there is no potential \\noffset on the table that is not already planned and communicated. So no easy fixes, no low hanging fruits. \\nWhatever comes is on top of our plans, and it  will be dilutive. Todd?  \\nTodd  Tuckner  \\nHi, Anke. You know, look, in terms of what's different, we wanted to highlight the things that we're doing \\nnow and demonstrate the initiatives we're undertaking and the plans that we have that will help us chip \\naway. You know, we're being realistic in term s of what we think the margins can be over the mid -term, \\nand we have a very comprehensive way at that. There is no silver bullet where there's one thing where you \\nsay that's going to effectively transform the pre -tax margin. But what I think you heard me say, and Sergio \\nalluded to in his opening, is that w e're very focused to actually across these various levers. We're \\nimplementing them all. And they're, you know, in the collective, we're going to contribute to improving the \\nefficiency of the business. So I'd say that's our focus and that's where we look, t hat's the outcome we're \\nlooking to drive.  \\nAnke Reingen , RBC \\nThank you.  \\n \\nJeremy Sigee , BNP Paribas  \\nYeah. Morning. Thank you. Two questions, please. Firstly, just to sort of revenue in the quarter, the capital \\nmarkets growth. So ECM and DCM was a bit less than some of the peer groups, 11% year -on-year. I just \\nwondered if there's any mix reasons for that or if there's any sort of delay still in Credit Suisse teams \\nbecoming fully productive. So just a question on capital markets revenues.  \\nAnd then second question is on the foreign subsidiaries topic. It sounds like you've reduced the UBS \\n \\n \\n Page 25 of 35 \\n \\n Americas CET1 ratio to around 20% from the previous 27%. In the past, you've run that anywhere from \\n14% to 22%. Is it realistic to think about going back into the mid to high teens in that subsidiary on a, say, \\nfive-year view?  \\nTodd  Tuckner  \\nHi, Jeremy. Just on the second one. So we are targeting and as you acknowledge from the capital \\nrepatriation, the CET1, capital in the IHC has come down significantly. We are targeting a lower CET1 \\ncapital ratio, say, in the upper teens level, but on a lik e-for-like basis under the Swiss standards, that's more \\nin line with the 13% to 15% CET1 capital ratio. So that addresses that.  \\nOn the IB question, I'll – just to point out on DCM, clearly, we're underweight versus peers. So you're \\nseeing that manifest in the, in our performance . In ECM, as I highlighted, you know, we're building, but the \\ntiming of our pipeline build is likely to yield more payback later in 2025 into 2026.  \\nJeremy Sigee , BNP Paribas  \\nOkay. Thank you.  \\n \\nKian Abouhossein , JPMorgan  \\nYes, thanks for taking my question. I really only have question regarding the key slide 32. Sergio, I get the \\nmessage : don't get overexcited in terms of how capital would be repatriated and sol ve potentially a capital \\nissue. But if I look at slide 32 and I got very excited when I saw the 13 billion, but clearly, it hasn't ended up \\nin the parent bank. It has been further upstreamed. It looks like it. And I'm just trying to understand the \\nrationale of the upstream and also trying to understand if there's room to downstream again, if necessary.  \\nAnd in that context and also trying to understand how much more capital is there in CS International? It \\nshould be something like 5 billion to 6 billion from what I calculate. And if there's any other subsidiaries \\nthat you would  highlight, where there's room for potential further upstreaming into the parent going \\nforward? So really just trying to square the process. I'm a little bit confused in that sense and if you could \\nhelp me, I would really appreciate  it. \\nSergio  P. Ermotti  \\nThank you, Kian. I'm sorry, and I really appreciate your enthusiasm. And I'm sorry that you started with an \\nenthusiasm and then you ended up being confused. So in that sense, I can only reiterate that we don't \\nreally have some , so much low -hanging fruits here. There is no short fixes. There are technicalities that I \\nthink that Todd can explain you now, but that's essentially the situation. So we have been quite coherent \\nand consistent in saying and planning for capital, you know , well ahead of the curve when we started to \\nplan for the 2026 targets.  \\nKian Abouhossein , JPMorgan  \\nSergio, just to add. I'm a bank analyst. I can get excited very quickly so just to put in context . \\n \\n \\n Page 26 of 35 \\n \\n Sergio  P. Ermotti  \\nWell don ’t tell me . \\nTodd  Tuckner  \\nKian, I think it's worth just pointing out that, remember, when we acquired Credit Suisse and the capital \\nratios  at the parent bank were, you know, distressed relative to what the UBS AG's fully applied capital \\nratio was and the strength and resilience of our capital on the UBS side. Also to consider, you know, the \\nequity double leverage that was there on the Credit Su isse side. And as we inherited that, the pressure it \\nput, you know, on our own, just given what we had to address and pushing up that double leverage.  \\nSo, you know, taking out the capital and rebalancing the capital from former Credit Suisse subsidiaries in, \\nsay, the UK and the US, you know, up to the parent and fundamentally at group level, as you say, has been \\npart of the plan, but also helps to allevi ate the pressure in the equity double leverage. And I think that's an \\nimportant point to mention. And that's why we made the comment that, you know, if there's going to be \\nonerous capital imposed on the parent bank, it's going to be funded with the retenti on of future profits.  \\nKian Abouhossein , JPMorgan  \\nAnd just on double leverage, how much of the 13 billion do you actually require for double leverage and \\nhow much do you allocate for payback to shareholders? So we just get an idea how much is potentially \\nexcess in the holding, if there's any.  \\nTodd  Tuckner  \\nIt's a – look, of that amount that we have repatriated, there's a significant part of it that is used to support \\nmoving to a more normalized level of equity double leverage level, a significant portion of it. Thank you, \\nKian.  \\nKian Abouhossein , JPMorgan  \\nThank you. Okay. And just on the 6 billion in the CS International, roughly 5 to 6 billion, is that correct, \\nthat's what's remaining?  \\nTodd  Tuckner  \\nYes, I highlighted that in my comments as well that that's what we see. You know, naturally, it's a function \\nof timing and ensuring that we continue to run down the positions in that entity and get the support from \\nthe regulator to repatriate the remaining capital in that entity as we transfer our positions , as I mentioned. \\nAnd, you know, there could be leakage between now and then if we have losses in the entit y. So, you \\nknow, conservatively, I mentioned around 5 billion that would come from CSI from here.  \\nKian Abouhossein , JPMorgan  \\nThank you.  \\nGiulia Miotto , Morgan Stanley  \\n \\n \\n Page 27 of 35 \\n \\n Yes. Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two. Going back to slide 31 on the Non-\\ncore deleveraging, how is it possible that, if I exclude op risk, which I understand is driven by a formula, \\nthat's fine. But on credit and market risk, capital risk came down by 42 billion since Q2 2023, and now you \\nonly plan to cut 7 billion in 2025. Why wouldn't we expect a faster deleveraging there given the market is \\nstill very supportive? And then secondly, thanks for all the additional detail on the GWM in the US. On the \\nNII discussion in that division, which I look forward to t he disclosure in Q1 - I guess having operating under \\na national charter other than Utah would help. But how quickly do you expect to get that license, please? \\nThank you.  \\nTodd  Tuckner  \\nGiulia. So on the credit and market risk ambition in terms of the levels taking it down,  you know,  I think \\nthis goes really to the point I highlighted in my comments in the context of the underlying PBT we see in \\n2025 versus 2024. I made comments that, you know, the positions at this point are much smaller than \\nwe've seen. They're hedged at times. They  could be – could have transfer restrictions associated with them. \\nWe have to ensure the counterparty is willing to terminate. There could be exotic security types with \\nbespoke features that limit potential buyers.  \\nSo there are a lot of issues as you get down into the portfolio and you have much smaller positions in these \\nbooks, that's going to take, you know, extensive amount of work to see, you know, chip away at progress. \\nSo a lot of the, you know, the big rocks a nd larger positions that generated significant RWA reduction, but \\nalso invited an ability to exit at levels above book value, you know, we're going to become further and \\nfarther and less likely as we move forward. So I think it's just important to understa nd that in the context as \\nwell of the RWA rundown.  \\nIn terms of your second question on the national charter and the timing, look, we're working on moving \\nforward with getting the application in. There's a lot of work being done. And we're going to work as \\nquickly as we can to get that rolled out and to enh ance our banking product offering. I mean, we're not \\nstanding still at the moment. We're doing a lot of work in that respect now also to, you know, go live. But \\ncertainly, having that license will unlock certain product capabilities that just aren't possib le until we have it.  \\nGiulia Miotto , Morgan Stanley  \\nGot it. But is it fair to expect that, you know, three years longer, shorter?  \\nTodd  Tuckner  \\nGiulia, I think that's just something we'll continue to update you on. I don't want to predict the process \\nbecause we're working obviously also with supervisors to get that, get the license approved. So the timeline \\nis something we're working actively on, but we'll keep you updated.  \\nGiulia Miotto , Morgan Stanley  \\nUnderstood. Thank you.  \\nSergio  P. Ermotti  \\nAnd maybe just to add on, on Non-core, we always said that at the end of the day, of course, if we really \\n \\n \\n Page 28 of 35 \\n \\n want to take down market and credit risk overnight, we could probably find a price at which to do it. But \\nnow if that price is well in excess of our cost of capital and expected return, that would be a stupid trade. \\nSo we are constantly looking to optimize  shareholder interest as we wind down this asset. So it doesn't \\nreally make sense to create new capital at a cost that is well above, how we expect to deliver in terms of \\nreturns.  \\nGiulia Miotto , Morgan Stanley  \\nGot it. Thank you.  \\n \\nStefan Stalmann , Autonomous Research  \\nHi. Yes, good morning. Thank you very much for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about the US wealth \\nmanagement plans, please. It looks like you're tilting  away the business mix from the high end of the \\nmarket towards more affluent and lower wealth brackets, which is pretty much the opposite of what \\nyou've been trying to achieve over the last 20 years, I would say. What has changed? Why are you coming \\nto thi s different assessment of the relative attractiveness of different wealth brackets in the US?  \\nAnd the second question, I just wanted to make sure that I understood this correctly. The share buyback \\nplans and aims that you outlined, they are not yet accrued and deducted from CET1 capital at the year end, \\nisn't it? Thank you very much.  \\nTodd  Tuckner  \\nHi, Stefan. The – yeah, with respect to the 2 billion [Edit: 3 billion ] that we aim to buy back, you know, \\nbased on the conditionality that Sergio described, that is correct. On the US wealth side, I think it's just \\nimportant to point out that it's not a shift in strategy. What we said was we're looking to rebalance more \\ninto the high net worth and affluent client segments. And the reality there is that one where we're quite \\noverweight in ultra, which is, of course, you know, our strength.  \\nBut it's also important to point out that the return on assets in that segment versus as you move down \\nclient segments is, of course, lower, and so the profitability as you move down segments is higher. And so \\nwhat we're trying to do is rebalance so to sta y obviously very, to stay very penetrated in ultra, but to \\nincrease our penetration in high net worth and affluent sort of to create a better balance in line, more in \\nline with the market, a bit more in line, although of course, we want to stay more overwe ight at the top \\nend because as I said, that's our strength and our what we bring to – the strength that we bring to the \\ntable.  \\nBut it is really important to emphasize that, yes, that versus the market, you could see that as we have on \\nslide 26, that, you know, we're looking just to shift and rebalance, you know, more into high net worth \\nand affluent where the profitability is impr oved. And yeah, the point is that...  \\nStefan Stalmann , Autonomous Research  \\nThank you  \\n \\n \\n Page 29 of 35 \\n \\n Todd  Tuckner  \\n...it's a – It's a rebalancing as opposed to a strategy change.  \\nStefan Stalmann , Autonomous Research  \\nOkay. Yeah. Just to quickly follow up on the first part of the question. Is the 1 billion share buyback plan \\nalso not deducted from CET1 capital or is it?  \\nTodd  Tuckner  \\nThat's in  [Edit: the CET1 capital i.e. not deducted] . \\nStefan Stalmann , Autonomous Research  \\nIt’s in. Okay. Thank you very much.  \\nAndrew Coombs , Citi \\nGood morning. One follow -up on GWM Americas and then perhaps I can touch on P&C, NII. On the GWM \\nAmericas, you highlighted a couple of times how you are adjusting the FA incentives to align them better \\nwith your  strategic goals around net new money, sign acquisition and NII growth. I bet if you can just \\nelaborate a bit more there on exactly what changes you are making, how you think those changes compare \\nto your US peer group, especially given your comment in the near term it might lead some FA attrition and \\nlower net new money? That's the first question.  \\nSecond question on the P&C  NII, it obviously has been of your biggest headwinds . You're guiding to , I think \\nthat was , well a  much more pronounced drop this year than last year. But you're still expecting it to plateau \\nafter the second quarter. So if I just ask, what are your rate assumptions? Take the SNB rate . And I think \\nyou made a comment that it should plateau regardless of where the rate trajectory is thereafter . So perhaps \\nif you could elaborate on that. And then also what your loan assumptions, given that your loan balances \\nshrunk by another  couple of billion this quarter. Thank you.  \\nTodd  Tuckner  \\nSo first ,  on your first question in respect to the FA comp changes, you know, I think the changes that I \\nhighlighted that aligned better with our strategy also are more aligned to what we believe or observe are \\nthe comp models at our competitors as well. We had certain features we think that were perhaps off \\nmarket and we are looking more to align with what our peers do.  \\nBut I think the more important point though is that, you know, in discussing this with, you know, many \\nfinancial and getting their take on these changes, it's clear that those who are very aligned with our \\nstrategy of bringing value to their clients and gr owing their books of business and, you know, as I said, \\nbringing more solutions to their clients from essentially across what we can offer, those FAs will benefit in \\nthis model, and they'll get paid more.  And I think that's the key point.  \\nMy comment about FA attrition is just that those who may have benefited from features that we have \\neliminated may decide that it – that they would be better off trading away and we have to cater for that \\n \\n \\n Page 30 of 35 \\n \\n prospect in our in our modeling and so that's why I mentioned that. But, you know, it's important to keep \\nin mind that the changes we're making are really not intended to reduce compensation, but to increase it \\nas long as it's being done in ways that are v ery aligned with our strategy. And I think that's the most \\nimportant point.  \\nOn P&C, net interest income, you had several questions. I mean, in terms of rate assumptions, well, first of \\nall, you know, the current rates are at 50 basis points, having come down 125 basis points over the last \\nthree quarters of 2024. There's an expecta tion, if you look at implied forwards, that the rate curve will \\napproach near -zero. So there is really a lack of deposit margin room for maneuver as we look out, which is \\nwhy, you know, we think that the full year 2025 NII, especially if rates move down further, will be even \\nmore pronounced than the Q1 guidance.  \\nI talked about plateauing, you know, once we inflect because if you look at the yield curve, it's actually \\nquite flat if not even inverted, but it's certainly flat. And as such, you know, we don't see movements in it. \\nSo therefore, you know, if it's effect ively hitting a trough, I see it plateauing. And then I commented that, \\nwhich was your other question, you know, if rates move, obviously, if they move up, it gives us a bit more \\ndeposit margin room for maneuver. If they move down into negative territory, that is also helpful because \\nwe can typically charge certain clients and also drive greater lending NIM as well.  \\nAs far as the expectation around loan balances, we have a stable outlook for lending in P&C and also a \\nstable outlook for deposits in P&C. So we're quite focused continuing to do balance optimization, ensure \\nthat the pricing reflects the appropriate cost o f risk and capital. And on the deposit side, we've been very \\nthoughtful in how we have moved pricing down in relation to the central bank dropping rates in order to \\nretain deposits where possible.  \\nStefan Stalmann , Autonomous Research  \\nVery helpful. Thank you very much.  \\n \\nAmit Goel , Mediobanca  \\nHi. Thank you and thank you for the clarifications on the capital. I've got just a couple of questions again \\non the US business. And so I guess, one, I was just wanted to understand a bit better, you know, as you get \\nto the 15% PBT margin in 2027, you know , what is the kind of plan or thought process in terms of getting \\nto kind of peer levels or 25%, 30% operating margin in the future or do you, I don't know if you think \\npeers are overearning? But what the step is there? And if, you know, building out the m ore comprehensive \\nbanking offering and delivery model is part of that, but what cost is involved in that?  \\nAnd then secondly, also just curious, in terms of the PBT margin that you're targeting to sustain in 2027, I \\nthink previously you were talking about mid -teens in 2026. So just to check, is that slightly later or is it the \\nsame basic expectation? Thank you.  \\nTodd  Tuckner  \\nYeah. So in terms of the expectations, we haven't really articulated that other than I've said in the past that \\nexpected mid -teens in the midterm. We talked about the business and Sergio and I've been doing this. So I \\n \\n \\n Page 31 of 35 \\n \\n don't think it's inconsistent. But where we're talking over the next couple of years to continue to build and \\nwe think by 2027, we'll be at that at the mid -teens level.  \\nI mean, as far as comparing to peers and we don't – this isn't a comparison to peers for us or sorry, \\nnarrowing. It's not about effectively catching peers, but it's more about narrowing the gap. That's what \\nwe've said consistently , in order to, you know, to improve the overall cost -to-income ratio for the business \\noverall. And in the US, to put us in a position where we're contributing significantly more to the overall \\nprofitability of Global Wealth Management.  \\nIn terms of the banking capabilities and the other capabilities I talked about, those investments are catered \\nfor in my comments. I did say that we're making incremental technology investments and also investments \\nin our capabilities and in the collective,  you know, that's also being priced into our 2025 pre -tax margin \\nexpectation. But also as we, you know, as we guided looking out to 2027 as well.  \\nAmit Goel , Mediobanca  \\nThank you. Can I just follow up just in terms of that investment and in terms of points of operating margin, \\nwould that be kind of 2, 3 or 5 percentage points of operating margin that you're investing in those years \\nor just to think about thereafter, how m uch could potentially drop out or how much is just ongoing \\ninvestment?  \\nTodd  Tuckner  \\nI'd just say the investments that we're making, we already – we've been investing in the business. So it's \\nimportant to keep that in mind. But we are making , now we're ensuring that the investments that we \\nmake in technology are done in a way where the payback is improved, as I mentioned, improved ROI. \\nWe’re also funding incremental investments, as I say, and that is captured in the pre -tax margin expectation \\nfor 2025 and as we grow it. So, you know, I wouldn't model it falling out. I mean, this will be technology \\ninvestments we're going to continue to make  for the business to help it grow.  \\nAmit Goel , Mediobanca  \\nThank you.  \\n \\nAntonio Reale , Bank of America  \\nGood morning. It's Antonio from Bank of America. Two questions for me, please. Actually, it's two follow -\\nups, really. One on capital and one on the P&C. So you've repatriated the 13 billion capital at the parent \\ncompany this quarter. And despite that, your CET1 ratio at the AG level was only up 20 bps or so Q -on-Q \\nto 13.5% now. Could you please explain why that was the case and maybe talk us through the moving \\nparts? I'm sorry if i t's a repetition, but I think it's important.  \\nAnd the second question is, again, a follow -up on your Swiss business. You've talked about your NII \\nguidance. Can you just remind us your sensitivity to rates and hedging structure in Switzerland? And more \\nin general, what flexibility would you have to mit igate some of this trend on NII with the rest for the P&L? \\nYou've alluded to more cost synergies. So if you can share a little bit more about the moving parts of the \\n \\n \\n Page 32 of 35 \\n \\n P&L, that would be that would be super helpful. Thank you.  \\nTodd  Tuckner  \\nSo in terms of the mitigants a bit to the headwinds, you know, we're definitely focusing on driving as you \\nsaw in 4Q continuing to drive where possible, non -NII revenue growth improve on recurring revenue and \\nP&C and also on transaction revenues. That will  be a focus to partially offset the headwinds that we see in \\nP&C.  \\nI mean as far as abilities to effectively hedge or extend duration, I mean that's just not when the rates are \\nthis low and with the flat yield curve, you know, extending duration, for example, on non -maturing \\ndeposits doesn't offer much of an advantage at all. In fact, it could lock in funding costs and rather than \\nallow us to benefit from future rate cuts, including if they go below zero and also creates some mismatched \\nrisk, mismatch risk as well. So, you know, if the rates are going to near zero, as I sa id, we have very limited \\nroom for maneuverability, and we just have to wait until we see some daylight in terms of changes in that \\nyield curve.  \\nOn the capital question you had in terms of what you're missing, I think in terms of the CET1 capital ratio \\nat UBS AG after it received the capital from the subsidiaries, you know, we are accruing a dividend to the \\nparent to address the point that I made b efore in response to Kian's question. So it's a dividend accrual that \\nwill serve as an offset to the – sorry, dividend accrual to group. To be clear, to offset the capital repatriated \\nto AG, it s first tier subsidiary.  \\nAntonio Reale , Bank of America  \\nThank you very much.  \\n \\nPiers Brown , HSBC  \\nYes, good morning, everybody. I just got two follow -ups. One, I just wanted to make sure on if I got the \\nmessage correct on client risk appetite. I mean, you've talked about the move into sweep  accounts and \\nobviously the fourth quarter NII was much better than we anticipated. But then on the transaction side, \\nyou're little bit below street  expectations. When I look at the loan number, that's still declining. So just \\nappetite for re -leveraging and sort of look forward on the client activity into the first quarter. Can you \\ncomment that, please?  \\nAnd then just a technical question maybe on the Basel III final outcome. I mean, I said it's basically no \\nchange to CET1. I think you had guided to a 30 basis points impact originally. So what's moved in your \\nfavor on implementation of Basel III final that 's caused a delta? Thanks.  \\nTodd  Tuckner  \\nHi Piers, so on – I'll just take your second question first. So in terms of the Basel III, look, I guided down last \\nquarter to a lower level than I had been guiding. You know, as we started to get more visibility and make \\nprogress, the team has done an excell ent job at ensuring that we were able to mitigate where we can in \\nsome of the aspects that were at work or infrastructure improvements, model alignments, also exiting \\n \\n \\n Page 33 of 35 \\n \\n positions and running down risks. So all of those things contributed to our ability to be able to, you know, \\nultimately print the day -one level that's far inside where we had guided.  \\nIn terms of re -leveraging opportunities, you know, for sure in Global Wealth Management with rates, you \\nknow, potentially higher, you know, we're not or not going , coming down as quickly as perhaps we \\nanticipated a quarter ago or certainly two quarters ago. You know, that's going to be helpful. That's going \\nto be helpful for deposit margins as I mentioned, but probably, we'll have a little bit of a chilling effect o n \\nre-leveraging, which is something that with rates coming down, we expect to see both in, you know, in all \\nparts of the of the wealth business, which involves really where we have US dollar exposure in the US \\nbusiness naturally, but also in our APAC part of the business.  \\nAnd so we, you know, if rates sort of back up, then we'll have positive effects on deposit margins, but the \\nextent of re -leveraging that we're pricing into the outlook, you know, we may see that come in less \\naggressively.  \\nPiers Brown , HSBC  \\nThat's perfect. Thanks. Just on global banking, you mentioned a 20% change in pipeline, was it up or \\ndown? I didn't catch that.  \\nSergio  P. Ermotti  \\nWhat we mentioned, it's not our pipeline. What we said is that according to market data. So the industry is \\ndown 26% year -to-date [Edit: 21% ], so for the first month. So our pipeline is building up. We are very \\nconfident about the ability to generate new business and build up our market share. But you know, if you \\nlook at according to market data, January, on January, you know, the amount of fe es and activity is down \\n26%  [Edit: 21% ] if I remember correctly.  \\nTodd  Tuckner   \\nSo yeah, it came in – the final number came in, yes, sorry, Piers, I got your question. The fee pool is down \\naround 21 percentage for January.  \\nPiers Brown , HSBC  \\n21, okay. So in any case, to handle in front so...  \\nTodd  Tuckner  \\nExactly. \\nSergio  P. Ermotti  \\nSo that's industry and not UBS. Just to be clear.  \\nPiers Brown , HSBC  \\nOk, Thanks very much  \\n \\n \\n Page 34 of 35 \\n \\n Sergio  P. Ermotti  \\nOkay. So there are no more questions. There are no more questions. So thank you for calling in and for your \\nquestions. So I'll touch base next quarter. Thank you.   \\n \\n \\n Page 35 of 35 \\n \\n Cautionary statement regarding forward -looking statements | This document  contains statements that constitute “forward -looking statements”, \\nincluding but not limited to management’s outlook for UBS’s financial performance, statements relating to the anticipated eff ect of transactions and \\nstrategic initiatives on UBS’s business and future  development and goals or intentions to achieve climate, sustainability and other social objectives.

Good morning and thank you all for joining our first  quarter 202 5 \\nearnings call. I am joined today by our Chief Executive Officer, Jane Fraser , and our Chief Financial Officer, \\nMark Mason.  \\n \\nI'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website, \\ncitigroup.com, may  contain forward -looking statements which are based on management's current \\nexpectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ \\nmaterially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those de scribed in our earnings \\nmaterials as well as in our SEC filing s. \\n \\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Jane.  \\n \\nJANE FRASER : Thank you, Jenn, and a very good morning to everyone. First, I am going to discuss our first \\nquarter results and then talk about the environment we are operating in and how we are positioning the \\nbank for it.  \\nThis morning, we reported net income of $4.1 billion and earnings per share of $1.96 with an R oTCE of 9.1%.  \\nOverall, it was a strong quarter, marked by continued momentum in each of our five businesses.  We \\nmaintained a disciplined approach to our expenses, which declined by 5% year -over -year.  We delivered our \\nthird consecutive quarter of positive  operating leverage for each of our five lines of business and the fourth \\nconsecutive quarter for the firm overall.   \\nWe increased both our return on tangible common equity in each business and our return of capital to our \\nshareholders.  This quarter is a further proof point of how the consistent execution of our strategy is \\nimproving our performance.   \\nServices recorded its highest first quarter revenue in a decade. TTS continues to demonstrate momentum in \\nthe key underlying drivers across U .S. dollar clearing and cross -border activity.  Securities Services gained \\nshare and grew its Assets Under Custody and Administration to $26 trillion.  \\nMarkets had a good quarter with revenue up 12%.  The three most significant Fixed Income businesses – \\nRates, Spread Products and FX – each contributed to an overall 8% increase over last year.  And i n a good \\nmacro quarter for Equities, we were up 23% as we continued with our long -term strategy to augment our \\nhigh derivatives share with a larger prime business.  \\nBanking was up 12%, as we continue to gain share in Investment Banking across most industry sectors.  Most \\nnotably M&A revenue nearly doubled.  We are seeing the benefits of our talent investments – as you can see \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  First  Quarter  202 5 Earnings  Call  \\nApril  15, 202 5 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 5 Citigroup Inc.   2 \\n by the lead ing role  we played  in some of the year’s biggest transactions such as advising Altair on the \\nSiemens acquisition and on the recently announced Intra -Cellular transaction by J&J.  \\nTurning to Wealth, all three businesses contributed to overall growth of 24% and fee revenue drove non -\\ninterest revenue growth of 16%. We remain focused on capturing assets our clients have “off” us as \\ndemonstrated by the roughly 11% organic growth in clie nt investment assets.  Andy and his new team are \\nmaking excellent progress executing our strategy, with the business delivering record revenue this quarter \\nand improved efficiency and returns.  \\nUSPB was up 2%, driven mainly by increased loan balances and spending in Branded Cards.  The high credit \\nquality of our cards portfolio reflects the focus we have put on prime consumers and our portfolio continued \\nto perform in line with our expectations.  Overall, USPB’s return increased to nearly 13%.  \\nDuring the quarter, we returned $2.8 billion in capital to our shareholders including $1.75 billion of buybacks \\nas part of our $20 billion plan, which is about $250 million more than we had originally guided.  That’s our \\nhighest quarterly amount since 2022  and demonstrates our commitment to returning capital.  We ended the \\nquarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.4% and our tangible book value per share crossed $90.  \\nTurning to our strategic priorities, our transformation investments continue to modernize our infrastructure, \\nsimplify our processes, and reduce manual touchpoints.  During the quarter, we retired legacy applications \\nand automated reconciliations to name but a few accomplishments.  \\nWe are also integrating AI directly into our business operations to improve the client experience.  The latest \\nexample is “Agent Assist,” our first generative AI tool for customer service in U .S. Personal Banking.  It is \\ndesigned to help our team resolve inquiries faster and it is now being piloted in credit cards.  \\nFrom quarter to quarter, we are building on our track record of progress, and I am confident in our ability to \\ncontinue delivering despite the uncertainty of the moment.   \\nIn terms of the macro environment, I am not going to try to predict the unpredictable.  While our corporate \\nand consumer clients are resilient and in good financial health, the world is in a wait -and -see mode and is \\nfacing a more negative macro -outlook than anyone had anticipated at the beginning of the year. And we \\nknow that prolonged uncertainty generally hurts confidence.  \\nThe changes underway globally will go beyond trade and tariffs.  In the U .S. for example, regulation and tax \\npolicy are all likely to look different in a year’s time.  These changes will not only have economic impacts but \\ngeopolitical and cultural ones as well.   \\nWe appreciate the Administration taking a fresh look at regulations across all industries to unlock growth.  \\nWe welcome the changes being discussed in our own industry to place more focus on material financial risks \\nand to make it easier for banks to contr ibute to economic growth and  to improve client service.  \\nWhen all is said and done, and these long -standing trade imbalances and other structural shifts are behind \\nus, the U.S. will still be the world’s leading economy, and the dollar will remain the reserve currency.  \\nThe deep knowledge and breadth of capabilities that we have from decades on the ground in so many local \\nmarkets are real points of distinction when serving our client s, from reconfiguring their supply chains , to \\naddressing their hedging and funding approaches , to advising on their strategic agendas.   \\nI am very confident that we have built a strategy based on a diversified business mix that will perform in a \\nwide variety of macro scenarios and is differentiating in times like these.  \\nWith capital strength, plentiful liquidity and strong reserves, we can navigate through any environment from \\na position of strength.  In periods of stress, we have shown that we are a port during the storm for our clients, \\nthe global markets, and the econo my, and this time is no different.  We are ready to lean in.  \\nAs I look forward to the rest of the year, we shall remain disciplined about returning capital and managing \\nour expenses whilst protecting necessary investments in our businesses as well as our transformation.  And \\nwe shall not allow the uncertainty to distract us from executing our strategy and improving our returns.  \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  First  Quarter  202 5 Earnings  Call  \\nApril  15, 202 5 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 5 Citigroup Inc.   3 \\n Now, over to Mark and then we would be happy to take your questions.  \\nMARK MASON : Thanks, Jane and good morning, everyone. I am going to start with the firmwide financial \\nresults, focusing on year -over -year comparisons unless I indicate otherwise, and then review the \\nperformance of our businesses in greater detail.  \\nOn slide 6, we show financial results for the full firm.  This quarter we reported net income of $4.1 billion, EPS \\nof $1.96 and an RoTCE  of 9.1% on $21.6 billion of revenues, generating positive operating leverage for the \\nfirm and in each of our five businesses.  Total revenues were up 3%, driven by growth in each of our businesses \\nlargely offset by a decline in All Other.  Net interest income excluding Markets was up 2%, driven by USPB, \\nWealth and Services, largely offset by declines in All Other and Banking.  Non -interest revenues excluding \\nMarkets were down 6%, as better results in Banking and Wealth were more than offset by declines in All  \\nOther, USPB and Services.  And total Markets revenues were up 12%.  Expenses of $13.4 billion, were down \\n5%.  Cost of credit was $2.7 billion, primarily consisting of net credit losses in Cards as well as a firmwide net \\nACL build, reflecting the uncertainty and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook.  Before I move on, I \\nwould like to note that certain card transaction processing fees paid primarily to networks were previously \\npresented in operating expenses and are now presented as a contra -revenue in non -interest revenue, \\nprimarily impacting USPB.  This change does not impact net income, and prior periods have been aligned. \\nWe’ve provided additional detail in the appendix of the presentation on slide 22.  \\nOn slide 7, we show the expense trend over the past five quarters. As we’ve said in the past, we are very \\nfocused on bringing down our expense base.  At the same time, the transformation remains our #1 priority, \\nand we will continue to make the investments needed, specifically as it relates to data and regulatory \\nreporting.  Having said that, the drivers of our expense reduction going forward remain consistent with those \\nthat we have referenced in the past . Savings related to stranded cost reduction, producti vity from our prior \\ninvestments and our organizational simplification,  all of which allow us to self -fund our investments in \\ntransformation.  As we look at this quarter, expenses declined by 5%, which included a favorable FX impact.  \\nThe decline was driven by a smaller FDIC special assessment, absence of a restructuring charge and lower \\ncompensation.  Partially offset by increases in technology and communications, professional fees related to \\ntransformation, as well as advertising and marketing.  And looking at  the rest of the year, we remain on track \\nto meet our full year expense target.  \\nOn slide 8, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics.  As I mentioned, the firm’s cost of credit was \\n$2.7 billion, primarily consisting of net credit losses in cards as well as a firmwide net ACL build.  The ACL \\nbuild reflects uncertainty and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook, including a further skew to the \\ndownside scenario in our CECL framework.  Our reserves now incorporate an eight -quarter weighted average \\nunemployment rate of 5.1%, which includes a downside scenario average unemployment  rate of 6.7%. \\nLargely offsetting this build was a release related to lower balances in our card portfolios.  At the end of the \\nquarter, we had $22.8 billion in total reserves with a reserve -to-funded loans ratio of 2.7%.  Now turning to \\nconsumer credit on the left -hand side of the page, approximately 85% of our card portfolios are to \\nconsumers with FICO scores of 660 or higher.  NCL rates increased sequentially in both card portfolios, \\nconsistent with historical seasonal patterns, and we continue to see stabi lization in delinquency rates across \\nboth portfolios.  And our reserve to funded loan ratio in our card portfolio is 8.2%.  And corporate non -accrual \\nloans remain low, reflecting the investment grade nature of our portfolio.  Based on the quality and mix of our \\nportfolio we believe we are well -reserved, but as always, we continue to monitor the evolving \\nmacroeconomic outlook.  \\nTurning to slide 9, where I will speak to sequential variances.  Citi’s $2.6 trillion balance sheet increased 9% \\ndriven by growth in trading -related assets , which is typical given the seasonal increase in Markets activity.  \\nWe also built our cash position as we let investment securities roll off and opportunistically issued long -term \\ndebt.  Loans increased 1% , driven by Services and Markets, largely offset by lower balances in cards.  Our $1.3 \\ntrillion deposit base remains well -diversified across regions, indus tries, customers and account types, and \\nincreased 2%, primarily driven by Services.  We reported 117% average LCR and maintained $960 billion of \\navailable liquidity resources. We ended the quarter with a preliminary 13.4% CET1 Capital ratio, down \\napproximately 20 basis points, as net income was more than offset by capital distributions, RWA growth and \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  First  Quarter  202 5 Earnings  Call  \\nApril  15, 202 5 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 5 Citigroup Inc.   4 \\n higher DTA deductions.  We continue to feel very good about the strength and quality of our balance sheet, \\nand our robust capital and liquidity position us well to support our clients in a range of economic \\nenvironments.  \\nTurning to the businesses on slide 10, we show the results for Services in the first quarter.  Services revenues \\nwere up 3%, driven by growth in TTS.  NII increased 5%, driven by higher deposit spreads as well as an \\nincrease in deposit and loan balances.  NIR declined 4%, driven by the absence of certain episodic fees in \\nSecurities Services as well as higher revenue share and the impact of FX across both TTS and Securities \\nServices.  That said, we continue to see strength in underlying fee drivers across the bu siness, as you can see \\non the bottom right -hand side of the page.  Expenses declined 3%, largely driven by lower deposit insurance \\ncosts, severance and legal expenses.  Average loans increased 6% , driven by continued demand for export \\nagency finance as well as working capital loans.  Average deposits increased 2% as we continue to see growth \\nin operating deposits.  Services generated positive operating leverage for the third consecutive quarter and \\ndelivered net income of $1.6 billion, and continued to deliver a high RoTCE of 26.2%.  \\nOn slide 11, we show the results for Markets in the first quarter.  Markets revenues were up 12%, driven by \\ngrowth across both Fixed Income and Equities.  Fixed Income revenues increased 8%, with  Rates and \\nCurrencies up 9%, reflecting increased client activity and monetization.  And Spread Products and Other \\nFixed Income, up 7%, driven by higher client activity and loan growth.  Equities revenues increased 23%, \\nprimarily driven by Equity Derivatives, on increased market volatility and higher client activity, an d \\nmomentum in Prime Services, with Prime balances up approximately 16%.  Expenses increased 2%, driven by \\nhigher volume and other revenue -related expenses.  Cost of credit was $201 million, primarily related to \\nSpread Products, driven by net credit losses and a net ACL build.  Average loans increased 7%, driven by \\nfinancing activity in Spread Products.  Markets generated positive operating leverage for the fourth \\nconsecutive quarter and delivered net income of $1.8 billion and an RoTCE of 14.3%.  \\nOn slide 12, we show the results for Banking in the first quarter. Banking revenues were up 12%, driven by \\ngrowth in Investment Banking as well as the impact of mark -to-market on loan hedges, partially offset by a \\ndecline in Corporate Lending.  Investment Banking fees increased 14%, with growth in M&A partially offset \\nby declines in DCM and ECM.  M&A was up 84%, as we gained share overall and across numerous sectors.  \\nDCM was down 3% compared to a near -record first quarter last year.  And ECM was down 26%, amid  a \\npullback in the wallet for follow -ons and convertibles.  Corporate Lending revenues, excluding mark -to-\\nmarket on loan hedges, declined 1%, as increases in revenue share were more than offset by the combined \\nimpact of lower loan balances and higher recoveries in the prior year.  Expenses declined 12%, largely driven \\nby lower compensation, as we see the benefits of our prior actions to right -size the workforce and expense \\nbase.  Cost of credit was $214 million, consisting of a n ACL build of $180 million, driv en by changes in the \\nmacroeconomic outlook, and net credit losses.  Banking generated positive operating leverage for the fifth \\nconsecutive quarter, and delivered net income of $543 million and an RoTCE of 10.7%.  \\nOn slide 13, we show the results for Wealth in the first quarter.  Wealth revenues were up 24%, with growth \\nacross Citigold, the Private Bank and Wealth at Work.  NII increased 30%, driven by higher deposit spreads \\npartially offset by lower deposit balances.  And NIR increased 16%, primarily driven by growth in investment \\nfee revenues, as we grew client investment assets by 16%.  This includes net new investment assets of $16.5 \\nbillion in the quarter and over $56 billion in the last 12 months, representing appr oximately 11% organic \\ngrowth.  Expenses were roughly flat, as the benefits of our prior actions to right -size the workforce and \\nexpense base as well as lower technology expenses were offset by higher revenue -related expenses and \\nseverance.  End -of-period client balances increased 7%, driven by higher net new investment asset flows and \\nmarket valuations.  Average loans declined 2%, as we continue to be strategic in deploying the balance sheet \\nto support growth in client investment assets.  Average deposits also declined 2%, driven by a shift in \\ndeposits to higher -yielding investments on Citi’s platform and other operating outflows, largely offset by \\nclient transfers from USPB, reflecting our ability to support clients as their wealth and investment needs \\nevolve.  Wealth had a pre -tax margin of 17% and generated positive operating leverage for the fourth \\nconsecutive quarter, and delivered net income of $284 million and an RoTCE of 9.4%.  \\nOn slide 14, we show the results for U.S. Personal Banking in the first quarter.  U.S. Personal Banking revenues \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  First  Quarter  202 5 Earnings  Call  \\nApril  15, 202 5 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 5 Citigroup Inc.   5 \\n were up 2%, driven by growth in Branded Cards and Retail Banking, largely offset by a decline in Retail \\nServices.  Branded Cards revenues increased 9%, with interest -earning balance growth of 8% and we \\ncontinue to see spend growth, which was up 3%.  Retail Banking revenues increased 17%, driven by the \\nimpact of higher deposit spreads.  And in Retail Services revenues declined 11%, primarily driven by higher \\npartner payment accruals.  Expenses were roughly flat, due to continued productivity savings offset by hi gher \\nadvertising and marketing as well as legal expenses.  Cost of credit was $1.8 billion, consisting of net credit \\nlosses, partially offset by a net ACL release of $172 million.  This included a build related to changes in the \\nportfolio composition and macroeconomic outlook, which was more than offset by a release due to lower \\ncard balances, largely in Retail Services.  Notwithstanding this release, our cards reserve to funded loan ratio \\nincreased to 8.2% from 7.9% last quarter . Average deposits declined 11% , driven by client transfers to Wealth \\nthat I just mentioned.  USPB generated positive operating leverage for the tenth consecutive quarter and \\ndelivered net income of $745 million and an RoTCE of 12.9%.  \\nOn slide 15, we show results for All Other on a managed basis, which includes Corporate /Other and Legacy \\nFranchises and excludes divestiture -related items. Revenues declined 39%, with declines across both \\nCorporate /Other and Legacy Franchises.  Corporate /Other was largely driven by lower NII as well as the \\nimpact of mark -to-market valuation changes on certain investments on NIR.  Legacy Franchises was driven \\nby the impact of Mexican peso depreciation, expiration of TSAs in our closed exit markets and continue d \\nreduction from our wind -down markets.  Expenses declined 17%, driven by a smaller FDIC special \\nassessment, absence of a restructuring charge, reduction from exit markets and wind -downs and the impact \\nof Mexican peso depreciation.  And cost of credit was $359 million, largely driven by net credit losses of $256 \\nmillion, driven by consumer loans in Mexico.  \\nOn slide 16, I’ll briefly touch on our full year 2025 outlook, which we’ve adjusted for the impact of the card \\ntransaction processing fee presentation change that I mentioned earlier, but is otherwise unchanged.  As you \\nknow, in January, we provided guidance for full year revenue and expense s as well as card NCLs – and that \\nguidance was informed by a number of scenarios and assumptions . Based on what we know today, and \\nassuming markets remain open and constructive, we still expect to deliver full year revenu es of \\napproximately $83.1 to $84.1 billion, with net interest income excluding Markets up approximately 2 % to \\n3%.  And we expect full year expenses to be slightly lower than $53.4 billion.  Clearly there remains a lot of \\nuncertainty, but we are confident that our diversified business model and resilient strategy can withstand \\nmany environments, and we remain well -positioned to support our clients.  So, while a lot is changing around \\nus, we remain steadfast and focused on continuing to execute on our transforma tion and strategy while \\nremaining disciplined with our expenses and capital with an eye towards improving returns over time.   \\nAnd with that . Jane and I would be happy to take your questions.  \\nOPERATOR:  Our first question will come from the line of Glenn Schorr  with Evercore . Your line is now open. \\nPlease go ahead.   \\nGLENN SCHORR : Hi, thanks very much.  So, I know it's early, but I'm curious if you could help us with a \\nrefresher on Treasury and Trade Solutions and Services in general. In terms of what opportunities there's risk, \\nbut also opportunities in helping clients manage through this re -tariffing and redrawing of economic lines. I \\nthink about nationalization and vertical integration as bad things, but a lot of shifting , and maybe you can \\nhelp clients deal with all that shifting. But anything any help there would be great.  \\nJANE FRASER:  Glen n, I would be delighted to do so.  So, our diversified business mix is very well positioned \\nfor a variety of scenarios. We think we'v e got a very broad suite of products and services. And they are the \\nones that clients need if they're going to be repositioning for a new order in trade or broader impacts here . \\nAnd think about what you've seen over the last few years where we played a very central role : the Ukraine -\\nRussia war, China, the COVID -related supply chains. We saw a lot of growth from deepening with clients and \\nacquiring new ones because they need us , because we have exactly the expertise and the products and \\nservices that multinational institutions need, and we have them in the places that they need it. Now , the mix \\nof those different revenues, different products and services we have could be different depending on which \\nscenario prevails. And what I have to say at the moment, the level of engag ement that we have with our \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  First  Quarter  202 5 Earnings  Call  \\nApril  15, 202 5 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 5 Citigroup Inc.   6 \\n clients all around the world, is just off the charts, given the unique depth of our presence and the insights we \\nhave in all the markets.  \\nSo, if I dig down a bit more, what would the persistence of high tariffs, what would it mean? Well, it would \\ndampen economic activity here in the in the U.S. and abroad. Cross -border trade flows will change , we'll be \\nin the middle of facilitating that. So, we expect to be very busy there along with the hedging and associated \\nfinancing activity that goes with it because it's not just about TTS. This is about the bundle of different \\ncapabilities we bring to bear. And take some comfort , look at what happened w ith the Ukraine war . We grew \\na lot in that time period. Equally, most of our business is very local. Think of what Services is, it's payroll, it's \\nsupplier management, it's liquidity, it's payables, it's receivables. And we're very deeply embedded into our \\nclients' day -to-day operations in every market they work in as well as across market flows. And that's not \\ngoing to  change. It's not nearly as sensitive to tariffs. And I would say, I think all of us recognize the \\nenvironment is very fluid right now. So l et me also just say for clarity sake, at the firm wide  level, our R oTCE \\ntargets for 2026 are still 10% to 11%. The drivers behind them are the same, but the revenue mix might be \\ndifferent. We'll certainly know more as things get clearer as to how that plays out.  \\nI think actually the other thing you mentioned about nationalization. Most of our clients have been clients \\nfor decades. I mean, a number of them have been clients for over a century. And it would not be British \\nunderstatement  to say that we are deeply embedded into them. I mean, it is extraordinary how deep we are. \\nWe've been on the ground for over a century, and we are viewed as quasi -local in most of these markets. Cit i \\nis not a bunch of suitcase bankers that fly in . We're not transactional. We're very u nique in the footprint. And \\nthese factors do make us less vulnerable to the different geopolitical dynamics that are going on.  \\nOPERATOR: Our next question comes from t he line of come from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line \\nis now open. Please go ahead.   \\nJIM MITCHELL : Hey good morning.  Maybe Jane, just following up on that conversation , and you talked about \\nleaning  into , as being a port in the  storm and leaning  into it. So, I guess in the near term, are you seeing sort \\nof demand already in terms of your balance sheet, whether it's raising liquidity and deposit flow like sort of \\nflight to safety deposit flows and sort of the trading aspect of it from this volatility in April,  have you sort of \\nalready seen greater demand from clients?  \\nJANE FRASER : What I'd say about the clients at the moment, you're seeing deals still happening. We've done \\na number of them, as we've talked about, even over this last weekend, we were pretty busy, but I would say \\nthat most clients are pausing their plans. Now no one i s taking bets  in the market right now. We're seeing \\nthem prep for more headwinds. So, we're seeing some bolstering of already strong balance sheet s. \\nRemember, our client base aren't the smaller companies in the mid -market that are going to get  more \\npummeled in this type of environment. So that our clients are getting ready. We're seeing some accelerating \\nof imports to stockpile inventories . We are seeing a pausing on significant CapEx, while everyone waits to \\nget clarity on the full agenda. And in that full agenda, remember, there's tax bill, there's deregulation actions. \\nThese are some positives that will be coming. It's a very big agenda. Clients appreciate it's going to take time. \\nIn terms of the trading side, what we're seeing is it is prett y orderly out there. There's a lot of complicated \\ndynamics happening, but it's not being catalyzed by liquidity crisis or other things going on. Let's not fight \\nthe war, the l ast war. The issue we're tackling at the moment is something different. And we're seeing clients \\ntaking the opportunity to de -risk. We are, others are , so that if we have more turbulence ahead, everyone is \\nin a stronger position for it, and that is a good thing. But it's early days, Jim. We've got to see how this unfolds.  \\nJIM MITCHELL:  Sure. No, I appreciate that color. And then maybe for Mark, I mean, you highlighted at least \\non a period -end basis, deposit growth and commercial loan growth looked pretty good on a period -end basis \\nquarter -over -quarter. So, I guess when we think about the  NII assumptions, deposit and loan growth looks \\ngood, but anything different given the strong start to the NI I ex -Market s story and seemingly some good \\nmomentum in deposit and loan growth. Do you feel good, better, worse on sort of your NII o utlook for this \\nyear?  \\nMARK MASON:  Yes. Thanks, Jim. Look, I continue to feel good about the NII outlook. There's obviously \\nuncertainty that Jane has referenced, but that 2% to 3% ex -Markets. We've talked in the past about what \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  First  Quarter  202 5 Earnings  Call  \\nApril  15, 202 5 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 5 Citigroup Inc.   7 \\n the tailwinds and headwinds are. And you referenced, we saw some of that play through in the quarter in \\nterms of deposit volumes. We saw a good operating momentum in our Services business in TTS in particular. \\nThe loan growth saw not just in average interest -earning balances on the Branded Card s side, but also saw  \\ntrade loan growth as well. And so those are going to be important tailwinds as I think about the balance of \\nthe quarter. You've heard me reference as well , reinvestment from maturing securities i n our investment \\nportfolio into higher -yielding assets, including cash, and you can see that on the balance sheet that some of \\nthat started to take place as well in helping deposit spreads. And then the team has been very, very engaged \\nas it relates to deposit repricing and managing beta through the current environment. So, the combination \\nof those things, along with the removal of the reduction of late fees are really tailwinds that contribute to \\nthat 2% to 3% growth, and then there's some headwinds. So lo wer rates on floating rate assets would be a \\n[head wind ]. The potential of FX translation, primarily in Mexico would be a [head wind ], but  net-net, I feel \\ngood about the 2% to 3% growth in NII ex-Markets.  \\nOPERATOR:  Our next question come s from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo . Your line is now open, please go \\nahead.   \\nMIKE MAYO: Hi, I just wanted to continue the discussion about , on one hand you’re a port  in the storm. \\nYou've been embedded decades and you're not a bunch of suit case bankers. So that message has  landed . \\nOn the other hand, I mean, you are the bank that facilitates global trade in the middle of a global trade war. \\nAnd so, I think the concern is not just the possibility that that revenues will nose dive , but credit will implode \\nor as I've heard many, many times that Citigroup is going to stub its toe, just 100 countries in the mix of it all. \\nWhat else can you say in addition to what you said to e ither reassure investors that the oversight is strong or \\nthat you have your arms around the situation, the best that that you can, again, recognizing it's a fluid \\nsituation. Thank you.  \\nJANE FRASER : So, you've seen us perform extremely well over the last few years in the face of pretty \\nwrenching changes in the global economy. You ’ve see n it with say, shifts in supply chains after COVID and \\nthen between the geopolitical tensions that are going on, you saw it in pretty significant changes that were \\nhappening from the Russia and Ukraine war. And you see us exactly as that, we are where the c lients come, \\nit's hedging for foreign exchange, interest rates, commodities, you see it for how they're looking at changing \\ntheir financing around, and we tend to be the ones that are helping them reconfigure the flows. So, from that \\npoint of view, we are the active agent in a lot this mix. And we are a port in the storm as I said, Mike, we've got \\nvery strong balance sheet , capital and liquidity to deploy. We have the big strategic changes and organization \\nchanges behind us, and they're enabling us to be on the front foot. And this is a firm that is much more agile \\nand able to respond and be much more focused on clients righ t now. So, I feel good about this.  \\nMARK MASON:  Yes. The only thing I'd add, I mean, Jane, you're spot on, right. We come in with a strong \\nbalance sheet, strong capital, strong liquidity. If you think about your point around credit, Mike, we've said \\nrepeatedly, and you can see it in the numbers. We skew towards the higher investment grade, larger \\nmultinationals who also come into this with strong balance sheets. We've been very disciplined about that \\nrisk framework, our risk appetite, both on the corporate side as well as it relates to our consumers.  And then \\nwhat we tend to see in times of stress is a flight to quality as it relates to deposits. And so again, depending \\non how this evolves, we're well positioned to manage whatever the needs are of our clients, whether that be \\nlending needs or the stor ing of liquidity, and we're very well reserved to manage whatever credit risk may \\ncome with that despite us being skewed towards higher quality names in both of those demographics.  \\nMIKE MAYO:  Okay. The flip side of this is you did say the drivers are same. They might be different in \\nmagnitude to take you from where you are now you had over 9% R oTCE in the quarter. You said you're on \\ntrack to get to 10% to 11% next year. Can you put a little meat on the bones kind of verbal waterfall chart, if \\nyou would, or maybe some numbers around org simplification stranded costs, productivity savings. How do \\nwe get from 9% in the first quarter to that magical double -digit return target for next yea r? \\nMARK MASON:  Again, as we talked about before, it is a combination of continued momentum on the top \\nline. And this is Jane's point around how that mix may evolve, but the 3% plus that we're expecting this year, \\nand again, in 2026 , is an important contribution to that. You often see in our business where one  may be \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  First  Quarter  202 5 Earnings  Call  \\nApril  15, 202 5 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 5 Citigroup Inc.   8 \\n under pressure, the other one tends to outperform and overcompensate whether it be Banking fees and how \\nthose evolve, but volatility that may come with that, that uplifts the Markets business. So that continued \\nfocus on top -line performance will be important. You've heard me reaffirm the expense target for 2025 in \\nterms of getting down to the $53.4  [billion] . We still have a path to getting less than $53 [billion]  in 2026. \\nThat will be important. Obviously, if revenue softens there, we will see expenses come down in tandem with \\nthat, a combination of volume -related transaction costs but other levers that we will look to pull in the \\nproductivity savings we expect to  come from prior investments is an important aspect as well. An d then \\nwe've continued to optimize the use of our balance sheet and the capital that we have. You see that we have \\nbrought our CET1 down to 13.4%. We're continuing to return capital. Those become very important aspects \\nto getting to that target. Now look, it's uncertain and how the world evolves is hard to forecast at this point, \\nright? So could a stressed macro environment create an impact on credit and a build of reserves, absolutely, \\nright? That could happen towards the end of 2025. If it does happen in 2025 and losses end up showing up \\nin 2026. They end up being self -funded, so to speak, by the reserves that would have been established. So, \\nwe sit here today and as Jane mentioned, we're seeing nothing that would suggest that we shouldn't be \\ntargeting the 10% to 11%  [RoTCE] . So, we remain committed to that 10% to 11%  [RoTCE] . There's a path with \\nthe combination of those levers that I've mentioned. And importantly, this quarter is yet another proof point \\nthat our strategy is resilient, that we've got the ri ght team on the ground to execute against it and that it's \\nshowing up in our numbers it's showing up in our returns.  \\nJANE FRASER: And I'd just remind everyone, we're a very different bank than the one  we were a few years ago \\nin terms of our business mix, our risk profile and all the investments we've made into the business. And I \\nthink you can see us managing the bank doing what we say we'll do and please take some confidence in that.  \\nOPERATOR:  Our next question will come from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.  Your \\nline is now open, please go ahead.   \\nEBRAHIM POONAWALA:  I guess Mark, just wanted to on Slide 9 and the capital waterfall. I guess we are all \\nthinking about what buybacks can do in the second half of this year. So, if you don't mind, one, the RWA sort \\nof drag , the 32 basis points. Is that normal as we think about what the RWA consumption should look like ? \\nJust talk about that in the context of getting to a 13.1% CET1 by the end of the year . And how we can back \\ninto the pace of buybacks.  \\nMARK MASON:  Yes. So, I'd say a couple of things. So one, last quarter, we announced a $20 billion share \\nrepurchase program. And we continue to feel good about that program, as you would expect. And we \\nincreased our buybacks this year, or this quarter, I should say, to the $1 .75 billion , seeing the strength of the \\nperformance that was playing out through the quarter. And so those are both, I think, indications of our \\ncontinued commitment to returning capital to the shareholders. We're clear on where we're trading, and \\nwe're clear that, th at is a smart thing to do once we've funded demand from a client point of view across our \\nbusinesses, that's accretive to returns. And so, the RWA consumption is tied to that demand that we see. We \\nthink we've seen good client demand across the platform th at's helped drive the top line momentum that \\nyou see in each and every  one  of our businesses that's helped to drive the improved returns that you see in \\nthe quarter in each and every one  of our businesses. And as we see that demand, again, accretive in returns, \\nwe'll be looking to meet that as a first priority. We are targeting the 13.1 % [CET1  Capital ratio ] by the end of \\nthe year. But as you know, we'll get a new stress ed capital buffer in June on the heels of the DFAST /CCAR \\nwork that's just been submitted , and we'll have to see what that tells us. That's hard to forecast as you well \\nknow. And so based on what that tells us will inform that downward trajectory, but that is what we're focused \\non. The combination of funding growth that's accretive to returns and returning capital to shareholders in a \\nway that's consistent with that repurchase program.  \\nEBRAHIM POONAWALA:  Understood. And I guess you mentioned, I think, in your prepared remarks, the \\nreserves on the card book went up to 8.2%. Remind us, I mean, I think , and the genesis of both questions is I \\nthink there's a fragility to your R oTCE guidance for next year that I think makes investors nervous. And I'm \\njust trying to get to the pieces around buybacks? And then in terms of credit, like how what's it baking in \\naround the unemployment rate? What would cause you to ratchet up provisioni ng in the nea r term? What \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  First  Quarter  202 5 Earnings  Call  \\nApril  15, 202 5 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 5 Citigroup Inc.   9 \\n kind of an implied  job market deterioration do we need to see for the credit outlook to deteriorate fast and \\nmaterially?  Thanks.  \\nMARK MASON:  Yes. Let me take that in a couple of different pieces. So, the first thing I'd say is that as I look \\nat our credit exposure and I look at the consumer, the consumer continues to be resilient and discerning in \\ntheir spend. And in fact, we did see spend hold up in the quarter, and we saw spend actually increase in our \\nBranded Card s portfolio , up about 3%. The consumer has - we've seen a shift towards essentials and away \\nfrom travel and entertainment. There's certainly a general performance that's consistent w ith what we've \\nexpected when we look at delinquencies, when we look at the loss rates that played to through the quarter, \\nthere are no surprises there as we think about that.  \\nJANE FRASER:  And April is performing in line with that as well.  \\nMARK MASON:  Thank you. Yes. And April has been consistent that. As we think about reserves, we ended \\nthe quarter at about $23 billion of reserves across the entire business. That's about a 2.7% reserve -to-loan \\nratio. When I look at the drivers of that, as you know, when we establish  when we do our [CECL ] analysis on \\na quarterly basis, we have three  scenarios that we run. A host of other stress scenarios, but that inform the \\n[CECL]  analysis , there are three  scenarios, the base case  scenario, there's a downside scenario and there's \\nan upside scenario. And as we looked at the macroeconomic outlook and key variables that go into those \\nscenarios, we assumed a deterioration in that macro -outlook. And we increased the probability or the \\nweighting towards the downside scenario in light of what we were seeing in the macro environment. When \\nyou look through to some of the of the key variables,  or one variable s you referenced , unemployment, the \\naverage unemployment rate was 5.1% across those three  scenarios. The unemployment rate in the downside \\nscenario, the average was 6.7% across those eight  quarters. And so, we've assumed some pretty meaningful \\nshifts in unemployment, particularly on that downside our analysis. That informed the increase in our ACL \\nreserves that's referenced in the deck . And that increase was offset a bit by the sequential reduction in \\nvolumes that is somewhat seasonal. So hopefully, that helps. We feel good  about those reserves based on \\nwhat we know and our current view of the macroeconomic environment, and we'll obviously do that on a \\nquarterly basis as things continue to evolve.  \\nOPERATOR:  Our next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Truist Securities.  Your line is now \\nopen, please go ahead.   \\nJOHN MCDONALD : Thank you. Hi Mark, I wanted to ask you about capital optimization levers that you have \\nto you've done , made some good progress in RWA mitigation . Is there still some room to go there. And then \\nalso, could you maybe increase the pace of DTA utilization to reduce the TCE density in a way to help the \\nRoTCE goal.  \\nMARK MASON: Yes, sure. So, look, we're always looking at opportunities to further optimize the use of \\ncapital. In Markets we've talked about last year a lot about the revenue to RWA as a tool that we've been \\nusing there. That's continued to increase that metric and ratio. We continue to look at, are we optimizing \\nbalance sheet and getting the broader revenue streams we 'd expect from our client base, when we do our \\ncorporate lending work and some of that is showing up in how we've now introduced the revenue sharing as \\na tool to ensure we're capturing broader revenues from clients when we are using balance sheet. So, we're \\nconstantly working through this and identifying opportunities to ensure we're getting the highest return on \\nthat. In fact, as you look thro ugh the material we provided, you'll see that in light of the improvement we've \\nseen across all of our businesses last year as well as our forecast for growth this year, there, in fact, is a shift \\nin the TCE. And so, the allocated TCE has gone down for man y of these businesses because they have shown \\ngood PPNR growth, good profitability. And so, as we stress test it internally, the stress ed losses with the \\nbusinesses have, in fact, come down. Now obviously, we have to adhere to the regulator stress test, and so \\nthat shifted from the businesses into Corporate /Other, but it is a positive sign as we think about how the \\nstress ed capital buffer might evolve and as we exit different parts of the franchise, the underlying segments \\nare already showing that that improvement would suggest lower levels of stress ed losses. And so that's \\nanother important point that we diligently manage even if we can't control the impact at the top of the house. \\nYour point around DTA, we continue to focus on bringing the DTA down. As you know, that is largely driven \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  First  Quarter  202 5 Earnings  Call  \\nApril  15, 202 5 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 5 Citigroup Inc.   10 \\n by our ability to generate more U.S. income, which we're also very focused on. We did see a pickup this \\nquarter, which is really just a timing difference pickup. It happens in the first quarter of every year. It is tied \\nto deferred compensation and loan lo ss reserves as timing difference DTA and as we earn more income \\nthrough the balance of the year and obviously create income tax liability, it will utilize that increase we saw \\nor offset that that increase we saw in the first quarter here. We are targeting bringing down in 2025 and in \\n2026 in order to contribute optimizing capital.  \\nJOHN MCDONALD:  I wanted to ask Jane about the Banamex IPO planning. Just an update on where that \\nstands, assuming that market conditions create some risk to the timing. Is it fair to say that there were pros \\nand cons from the shareholder perspective to holding on to that  business longer given that it's a profitable \\nentity?  \\nJANE FRASER: Look, first of all, we continue to be on track with the preparation for the IPO, John. I was just \\ndown in Mexico  last week. And the team is fully focused on driving Banamex's business performance . I was \\nvery pleased to see improvements and not the underlying drivers of their performance when is down there. \\nAnd they're also focused on getting the work done to be able to go public, things like the prepared audited \\nfinancial statements or filling the various regulatory requirements. As we told the m we want to see the \\nbusiness performance improving and we want to make sure that we are doing everything in our control to be \\nin a position to IPO by the year -end. And to the second part of your question, we will always look at what we \\nbelieve to be in th e best  interest of our shareholders. We believe that the best interest of our shareholders is \\nto be able to IPO this business. We think that is the right thing. It fits with Citi's strategy for all the reasons \\nwe've talked about in the past, we're the best  owner of the corporate franchise we have there. We are not the \\nbest owner of a domestic bank. So, the timing of when we IPO will be driven by market conditions. It will be \\ndriven by the timing of regulatory approvals. So that could move that from 2025 into 2026. And we will \\nalways be guided by what we think will maximize value for our shareholders.  \\nOPERATOR:  Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin  with Autonomous . Your line is now open, \\nplease go ahead . \\nKEN USDIN : Thanks, good morning. I wanted to follow up on the points you made about the consumer \\nhanging in there through April. And Mark, you mentioned that there could be more uncertainty as we get \\nlater. But I believe you're still intact with your charge -off guide s for the year. I think just noticing Retail \\nServices was, I think, expectedly higher than high end at 6 .43%. Can you just remind us again how you're \\nexpecting the cadence of credit card losses to trajected for both Branded Cards and Retail Services as you \\ngo forward?  Thanks.  \\nMARK MASON: Sure. Again, we do obviously feel that we are well reserved here. We did expect to see a \\npickup in the first half of the year before trending down in the back half of the year. And so that's kind of the \\ncadence that we'd expect between now and the end of t he year. The first half is usually seasonally higher \\nthan the back half of the year, and you see that in Retail Services. I would also point out that and you can see \\nit in the deck and I think it's the second page of the appendix but also in the supplement , you are starting to \\nsee that delinquency buckets, we show the 90 -day plus delinquency bucket starting to trend down in Retail \\nServices, that is also an important indicator in terms of how we look at the expected losses, if you will, in the \\ngo forward. And so that seasonality as well as that trend is a good sign.  \\nJANE FRASER:  We've also , I think one  of the pieces Gonzalo and the team have done a good job with is , \\nthey've been proactive and tightening risk and acquisitions and existing programs in the last couple of years. \\nAnd I think that also puts us into another reason where we feel in a good position as we head into whatever \\nlies ahead.  \\nKEN USDIN:  Very good. And one just a follow -up on NII and your outlook. Did you make any changes to \\nincluding card fee still in the NII guide? Is that now removed? Does that fill in there? I know there's a lot of \\nputs and takes given the change in the forward curve, if you can help us understand which curve you're using \\nand some of the balancing act there, that would be great.  \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  First  Quarter  202 5 Earnings  Call  \\nApril  15, 202 5 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 5 Citigroup Inc.   11 \\n MARK MASON: Yes. So, look, the late fee impact is , for us , is important, and we included it in the range that \\nwe had given, and we still feel good. We've now removed it, obviously, with the changes that have taken \\nplace, but we have not changed our range because there's obviously going to be puts and takes that o ccur. \\nIt does have an impact on the Retail Services print that we have in the quarter and more importantly, the \\nyear -over -year that you see there of down 11% because, as you know, we share profits w ith those partners. \\nAnd so that that that down 11% we see in the quarter is informed by last year where we had an assumption  \\nthat the late fee rule was going to come into play and therefore, we had less profit to share with our partners \\nversus this year first quarter where we've assumed it would not come into play and, therefore, have more \\nprofits to share with our partners. An d so important to point that out on Retail Services, which jumps out in \\nUSPB, that it's unlikely that we see that downward percentag e in the remaining quarters because it's really \\na byproduct of what we assumed last year. versus this year on late fees. In terms of the curve and the NII \\nguidance we gave, we assumed two  to three  [U.S. interest rate] cuts. We're now assuming a fourth but given \\nthe timing and that it would be back -loaded in the year, it doesn't have a significant impact on the NII \\nguidance that we've given, the 2% to 3% ex -Markets.  \\nOPERATOR:  Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open, \\nplease go ahead.   \\nBETSY GRASECK:  Hi good morning.  Two questions. Just first on the buyback. I noticed you came in at $1.75 \\nbillion. Is that right this quarter?  \\nMARK MASON: Yes.  \\nBETSY GRASECK:  And I know you indicated that you're looking to keep pace. And I'm wondering, does that \\nmean at $1.75 billion or does that mean keep pace with the increased Q -on-Q, which was $250  million? And  \\nso, I know you're laughing, just trying to understand how you're thinking about that, given what we discussed \\nlast quarter, which is you have so much opportunity here for buyback and the accretion is so powerful. So, if \\nyou don't mind.  \\nMARK MASON: Sure. So, look, we're targeting a similar level. As you know, we've been working to bring the \\nCET1 [Capital ratio] down. We brought it down 20 basis points this quarter. We're still focused on bringing it \\ndown to 13.1%. There is uncertainty. The uncertainty is multifaceted. And to some extent, you think about \\nthe uncertainty with the SCB. We'll hopefully get some clari ty on that as we often do in the summer, and that \\nwill inform the pace at which we bring that that down. And then there's the bro ader market uncertainty, and \\nwe want to obviously be there to support clients, and the demand may come on the heels of that. And so, \\nthis quarter, like I said, similar level of share repurchases . $20 billion program that we will continue to work \\nthrough . SCB clarity soon, hopefully, favorable clarity, and we're steadfast focused on it. Ja ne, I don't know \\nif you want to add anything to that?  \\nJANE FRASER: We like buying back and giving capital back to our shareholders. So, it's a priority for us and \\nwill continue to be.  \\nBETSY GRASECK:  Okay. Excellent. And then, Jane, just separately, on Slide 2, you identify the main priorities \\nfor 2025 and 2026, many of which we've talked about here this call. I just wanted to understand from your \\nperspective on the transformation, how far along do you feel you are in the modernizing your infrastructure? \\nAnd what kind of time frame do we have to go from here t o check the box on that one, if you ever can check \\nthe box. And then separately on the Commercial Banking segment, if you could jus t give us some insights \\nthere, too.  \\nJANE FRASER:  Okay. There's a lot in there. So, as you remember, the transformation is a very large body of \\nwork. We're overhauling our infrastructure. We're reducing and modernizing our applications . We're \\nsimplifying our processes. And so, we're addressing the different root causes of what held  us back , \\nthoroughly and once  and  for all. And I feel good about the progress we've made. We're seeing more and more \\nof the benefit into how we run bank. As you know, we fell behind in data, particularly regarding regulatory  \\nreporting. We've taken action to get that into shape, and we're confident in how that's now progressing. In \\nmany parts, the risk management compliance programs, we're already operating at or c lose to the target \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  First  Quarter  202 5 Earnings  Call  \\nApril  15, 202 5 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 5 Citigroup Inc.   12 \\n state. So, our focus is now ensuring we're delivering the risk reductions and the outcomes in a sustainable \\nway. And I'm excited about the work we've been doing in making sure that our technology and our overall \\ncontrol environment is what we call modern and simple.  We're simplifying and standardizing controls across \\ncommon activities. We've put a lot more preventative and detective controls in place. We're upgrading others \\nthat weren't effective enough. We're driving automation. We're driving straight -thro ugh processing of our \\nend -to-end processes across the bank. And you've heard us talk pretty consistently over the last couple of \\nyears about the work to make the technology infrastructure onto consolidating on to single platforms, \\nretiring legacy applicati ons. So, I'd say where we are as many of the efforts are now impacting how we run \\nthe bank better and more efficiently and in a much more controlled way. There's still work to do. And as you \\nsay, I'm not sure any bank finishes its modernization because the  pace of innovation is there. And we're still \\ninnovating and investing in supporting our businesses , with new innovations in different areas . Talk briefly \\nabout AI, a lot of work in Services there, USPB and Andy in Wealth. So, there's a lot going on. I think you can \\ntell I'm pretty excited about it. I'm pleased where we're headed and at the pace we're heading.  \\nOPERATOR:  Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is now open, please \\ngo ahead.   \\nJANE FRASER: I forgot to do the C ommercial Bank side. We can come back to it. Sorry, Betsy, I forgot to \\nmention the Commercial Bank in my enthusiasm on our  modernization efforts. Look, I think we are \\npositioned to be the go -to bank for commercial clients. So, these are ones with cross -border needs. We've \\ngot these unique capabilities that , particularly the born -digital clients who are then going global very quickly , \\nthey can just sit on top of our existing capabilities in Services. And we help them go globa l. Then we help \\nthem think about their IPO or M&A or financing opportunities and the banking wallet builds on top of it. \\nWe've got quite a unique value proposition. I've been very pleased to see the growth we've been seeing in \\nacquiring new companies, who will be the future major players as they grow in global economies. And this is \\nhappening in many of the big bright spots around the world. It's in India. It's in Australia. It's happening in \\nJapan. It's happening through Europe as well as in North America.  So, a lot of good future growth activities \\nthere, good returns.  \\nOPERATOR:  We will now take our  next question from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is now open, please \\ngo ahead.   \\nERIKA NAJARIAN: Hi, good afternoon.  Just a follow -up question here on the buyback pacing. Your message \\nhas been pretty clear about the first half versus the second half. That said, with the stock at $65 versus \\ntangible book at $90, I guess, are you just so scared from the volatility of the S CB result that, that just must \\nbe hurdle before you can accelerate the buyback? And Mark, perhaps if you could sort of dispel some of the \\nnotion that sometimes happens in some of these chats with buy -siders about your in ability to dividend from \\nthe bank sub to the holding company in order to increase your buybacks over the near term. If you could \\naddress that, too, that would be great.  \\nMARK MASON:  Yes, sure. So, look, we have accelerated the pace of buybacks. And I think this quarter is a \\ngood example where I had guided for $1.5 billion, and we kicked it up to $1.75 billion. And I think you should \\nexpect that as we see opportunities to continue to d o that, then we're going to do it. And you should expect \\nthat given where we are trading relative to book value that we're constantly focused on those opportunities \\nto take it up more than we had planned or more than expected. Look, I think we are, we have seen a lot of \\nvolatility in the SCB. And we're not the only ones. Other players in the industry have as well. I think we're \\nencouraged by the dialogue that we're hearing, but there is still some risk to the SCB coming in different this \\nyear versus  last year. And I think , I don't think we should lose  sight . We're not losing sight of that. So, we'll \\nget more clarity when the SCB comes, I think that will be important. We obviously are generating good \\nearnings quarter after quarter, which obviously cre ates the capacity for us to do more here. And I think we've \\nevidenced a willingness to do that. I think in terms of your other question with regard, your question implying \\nwhether there are any restrictions. We don't have any restrictions on the buyback s. We would not have \\nannounced a $20 billion buyback program if we didn't think we could execute the program in a reasonable \\namount of time. And so obviously, we disclosed what we dividend out from the bank, and you can look at \\nthat over the last three  years,  we've dividend somewhere in the range of $0 to $5 billion in any given quarter. \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  First  Quarter  202 5 Earnings  Call  \\nApril  15, 202 5 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 5 Citigroup Inc.   13 \\n But again, there are no restrictions imposed by the FRB, which governs the parent on the ability to pay \\ndividends and buy back stock. In addition to that, we have multiple sources of funding, including loans to \\nsubsidiaries, which could be remitted as well  as debt issuance programs as well as the earnings that are \\ngenerated that put - we are well positioned to do , to execute on the program that we've described and to \\ncontinue our desired pace of buybacks.  \\nERIKA NAJARIAN:  Got it. And just my second question. Mark, you mentioned the four  cuts that's now \\nembedded in your NII outlook, I'm guessing that's for the U.S. How should we think about how you're \\nthinking of global rates ? Obviously, it's a basket of countries and currencies that we have to think about . And \\nif your top exposures are exposed to lower rates, how should we think about deposit spreads in Services from \\nhere?  \\nMARK MASON : I think I'd say , I guess the easiest way to answer the question is to point to the IRE analysis \\nthat we show on a quarterly basis. And there are a lot of - that's obviously a risk measure. There are a lot of \\nlimitations associated with taking it too deeply or taking it too  literally, but as you know, it is a view on how \\nlower rates could impact Citi over a 12-month period. It assumes a static balance sheet, no growth, no \\nchange in composition or mix or changes in our hedging actions. And it is an instantaneous shock to the \\nentire curve. With that said, we do break out the impact for U.S. dollar versus non -U.S. dollar. Remember, as \\nyou just referenced, there are over 60 currencies, but that asset sensitivity would suggest with a  - in the \\nfourth quarter  - with a 100 -basis point move across the currencies that the non -U.S. dollar impact would be \\n$1 billion over a 12 -month period. And so that take that with a grain of salt, but that gives you some sense as \\nto the sensitivity to rates, that would assume all o f those currencies and  rates in those countries moved at \\nthe same time across the curve , and we did nothing to actively manage or dynamically manage the balance \\nsheet.  \\nOPERATOR:  Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.  Your line is now open, \\nplease go ahead.   \\nVIVEK JUNEJA : Thanks for taking my questions.  A couple of them as follow -ups to questions that have been \\nasked. First one  for you, Mark. The doing buybacks of the dividending  from the bank to the holding company \\nthat we just asked. How much are you willing to let your double leverage go up? Is there any sort of internal \\nlimits that you follow, what would be the implications of that from a funding cost standpoint ? \\nMARK MASON : Yes. Look, we have internal limits. We have management action triggers internally. We're not \\nanywhere close to those limits or triggers . It's not something that I'm worried about as it relates to the \\nbuyback program that I have and/or the buybacks that we forecasted over the balance of the year.  \\nVIVEK JUNEJA:  Jane, sharing about all turmoil and reading some new stories about mandates being shifted \\nfrom U.S. broker -dealers to local players. Jane, are you concerned about that? Is that a shift that's starting \\noutside the U.S.  for big players like yourselves and others who are widespread globally, does this start to \\ncreate stronger competitors or move some business away over time?  \\nJANE FRASER : No, it doesn't. We haven't seen any shifts of business away from us. And just remember the \\nnature of our business. These are many of these markets around the world we've been in for over a century. \\nWe were the first bank in , sometimes we're the only international bank  in, and we truly have a unique \\nfootprint that we are everywhere, and we're able to connect everything everywhere, and there aren’t  other \\nbanks that have this. They don’t have the scale, they don't have the depth of local capabilities. They don't \\nhave the risk management skills. You don't have all of these different elements that the clients need now. \\nAnd they need in this type of environment where things are shifting aroun d. It's very easy to move your supply \\nchains around on our platform , to shift  the mix of different businesses. You're doing different geographies \\nyou're in. And as I said, a lot of the work we do is very local, and we're at the cutting -edge  leading edge, in \\nServices, both in TTS, custody, in particular, our corporate bank ers have  got very strong, deep relationships. \\nWe've got balance sheet strength. So, you tend to see flights to quality in these environments. And when \\nyou're in the emerging markets, there is only one  word for quality, and that's Citi.  \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  First  Quarter  202 5 Earnings  Call  \\nApril  15, 202 5 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 5 Citigroup Inc.   14 \\n OPERATOR:  Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.  Your line is now open, please \\ngo ahead.   \\nGERARD CASSIDY:  Hi Jane, Hi Mark. Mark, you touched on in your opening comments about the seasonal \\nincrease in trading -related assets. And then the growth was very strong. Was there any types of strategies \\nthat you guys employed? Because when you go back in other season al periods, first quarter of prior years, \\nwe've not seen this kind of growth. So, what led to this kind of success of growing your trading assets so well \\nthis quarter?  \\nMARK MASON: Yes. Again, it's the growth you've seen across the platform  in both fixed income as well as \\nequities and so that equities growth of 23% strong performance in derivatives in prime and prime balance \\ngrowth tied to that particularly with hedge funds and asset managers as they looked at regional reallocation, \\nstrong contribution there. And then, rates and currencies , good  increase d client activity in portfolio trading. \\nAnd then, we saw a lot of good spread product momentum driven by higher client ac tivity and loan growth . \\nAnd so, the nature of the activity, the structure of the products and what have you were all contributing \\nfactors there. Really strong performance across the business. And it obviously shows up in both the assets \\nand the – the trading assets and the tradin g liabilities and the funding mechanisms associated with that.  \\nGERARD CASSIDY:  Very good. And then as a quick follow -up, you guys gave us good details about the \\nallocation of equity. I think it was Slide 23. I was curious , I noticed that you've lowered some. The total equity \\ndoesn't change, of course, but you did lower the allocation of the equity for different lines like Wealth and \\nBanking. What was the thinking behind lowering it in the first quarter relative to 2024?  \\nMARK MASON:  Yes. So, as you probably know, Gerard, we kind of look at this on an annual basis. It's a \\nprocess that we run , and we run it at the end of the year with an eye towards how we want to make \\nadjustments in the year that's following. As we looked at the performance of the business, overall, our five  \\nbusinesses have improved their PPNR and their profitability and therefore, improving their resiliency in \\nstress scenarios and reducing their stress losses. And so, as we thought about that that underlyin g strength \\nwe saw as well as our forecast for what demand would be through 2025 , those were important factors in \\nthat allocation or that attribution to the businesses for TCE. So, in a way, they're getting the benefit of that \\nimproved resiliency even before it shows up in our Stress Capital Buffer, right? And so, each of the \\nbusinesses , we talked about Markets as a great example. We've been talking about optimizing use of capital , \\nrevenue to RWA , and the improvement all last year. We talked about that. And you see that showed up in \\ntheir performance, but also showed up therefore, in the amount of TCE allocation that they have this year. \\nSo hopefully, that helps. Obviously, regulatory capital hasn't changed in the aggregate, that's comprised of \\nthe RWA, GSIB and Stress Capital Buffers. But over time, we'd expect, as we've talked about our strategy, \\nwe'd expect exits to obviously continue to come off the balance sheet, and we'd expect our strategy and the \\nresiliency of our PPNR and the steadiness of those earnings to ultimately sh ow up in our Stress ed Capital \\nBuffer . \\nOPERATOR:  Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.  Your line is now \\nopen, please go ahead.   \\nMATT O’CONNOR:  Hi, just a follow -up on the expenses , came in a bit lower than expected 1Q even ex the \\naccounting change. What's your thought process for the rest of the year? Because I'm getting at is off in 1Q \\nthe high -water mark. So, if you trickle down a little bit from here, that would imply costs comin g in a below \\nwhat you're expecting. Can you just talk about the trajectory here?  \\nMARK MASON:  Sure. So again, I gave kind of stuck to the guidance that we had given in January. So expenses  \\n$53.4  [billion ] for the full year. We did come in at $13.4  [billion ] in the quarter. I kind of went through the puts \\nand takes around that. I'd expect probably a bit of a tick  up in Q2 when I think about the things in front of us \\nand some of the continued investments that we plan to make in transformation and some of the other things \\nunderneath that, like data and regulatory  reporting. And then I'd expect it to trend down so that we get to \\nthe target of the $53.4 [billion ] that I referenced for the full year. And so likely see a tick up and then a trend \\ndown and landing the full year at the guidance here.  Obviously, revenue moves . Sorry, go ahead.  \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  First  Quarter  202 5 Earnings  Call  \\nApril  15, 202 5 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 5 Citigroup Inc.   15 \\n MATT O’CONNOR:  No, no, please go ahead.  \\nMARK MASON:  I'd say, obviously, if revenue moves in either direction, we'll adjust accordingly. If we have \\nupside to revenue, you'd expect to see some of that variable in transaction costs move in that direction as \\nwell. And if we see pressure on revenues, we'll be focused on ensuring that we are bringing our expenses \\ndown as well.  \\nMATT O’CONNOR:  Okay. And then just any way to frame how much cost will go up from 1Q to 2Q based on \\nwhat you're thinking there?  \\nMARK MASON:  I'm not giving second quarter guidance kind of beyond what I've factored into the full year at \\nthis stage.  \\nOPERATOR:  Our next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with HSBC . Your line is now open, please \\ngo ahead.   \\nSAUL MARTINEZ : Just following up on the expenses. Your 202 6 target of a 10% to 11% R oTCE , I think you're \\ntargeting expenses being below $53 billion. I assume with the accounting change that should recalibrate to \\nbeing below, call it, $53.5  billion , is that , or $52.5  billion,  sorry. Is that a fair assumption or a conclusion from \\nthat?  \\nMARK MASON:  Sure. $52.6 [billion ]. \\nSAUL MARTINEZ:  I was just  rounding down.  \\nMARK MASON:  Yes. Yes, I bet. But yes, I mean it's a change in line -item  terms of that association fee. And \\nsure, I targeted 2026 as less than $53 [billion ]. And with that $400 million, you sure you can deduct that \\nfrom the $53 [billion ]. \\nSAUL MARTINEZ:  Got it. Just wanted to clarify that. And then I guess, secondly, on wealth management. The \\nnet new assets are pretty impressive then they trend, $16.5 billion, I think, something like 11% of beginning \\nperiod of client assets over the last couple of quarters. So, it seems like Andy is really delivering there. Just \\nanything in strength across the different products, but anything you want to highlight there as to what's \\ndriving that? And any comments just on the durability of that kind of moment um?  \\nJANE FRASER : Look, the strategy that Andy has laid out and talked about is working. We've got the franchise \\nvery focused around net new investment assets , bringing those in from the $5 trillion of assets that are off \\nus with existing clients , as well as new wealth that that is being created and new clients we're bringing to the \\nfranchise. And so, I'm very pleased as well with the caliber of the team that he has brought to bear here. We've \\ngot real horsepower and firepower in our investment cap abilities. And he is also investing to improve client \\nexperience, a new relationship with Palantir here as well. And it's a team that's on the front foot. And in this \\nenvironment, around the world, clients are really looking to us for advice because there are not many global \\nwealth managers. They're looking to us for a global perspective, the capabilities we've got on the ground all \\naround the globe and helping put them into good position amidst the u ncertainty. So, we are a destination \\nof choice right now, and we're taking full advantage of it. I don't see that changing. This is the strength of Citi . \\nThe strategy is working.  \\nOPERATOR:  There are no further questions. I'll now turn the call over to Je nn Landis for closing remarks.   \\nJENNIFER LANDIS: Thank you all for joining us. We appreciate all the questions. Have a great afternoon.  \\nOPERATOR:  This concludes Citi's First  Quarter 202 5 Earnings Call.

Good morning and thank you all for joining our fourth  quarter \\n2024 earnings call. I am joined today by our Chief Executive Officer, Jane Fraser , and our Chief Financial \\nOfficer, Mark Mason.  \\n \\nI'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website, \\ncitigroup.com, may  contain forward -looking statements which are based on management's current \\nexpectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ \\nmaterially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those de scribed in our earnings \\nmaterials as well as in our SEC filing s. \\n \\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Jane.  \\n \\nJANE FRASER : Thank you, Jenn, and a very good morning to everyone. I am going to start with the macro \\nbackdrop, and then walk you through our results for the full year. I will share some thoughts on the progress \\nwe are making executing our strategy and then conclude wi th why we have decided to adjust our 2026 \\nreturn target.  \\nWe entered 2025 with strategic clarity and good momentum across all our businesses.  From the global \\nmacro perspective, economies have done a good job tolerating hikes from central banks, and inflation has \\nclearly been receding. While policies will certain ly impact economic activity, whether in the form of tariffs or \\ntaxes, 2025 doesn’t look that different from 202 4.    \\nThe U.S. remains at the heart of the macro picture.  Growth is not only being driven by the higher end \\nconsumer, but also by a strong, innovative corporate sector.  China’s growth has been slower than expected \\nbut there is still the prospect of further sti mulus.   Europe continues to underachieve.  And many emerging \\nmarkets have re -emerged as bright spots, a trend which certainly benefits us given our global network and \\ndeep presence in countries such as India and throughout the Middle East and ASEAN.  I told you 2024 was a \\ncritical year and I am proud of what we accomplished and how our businesses performed.  We finished with \\na very strong fourth quarter, which Mark will detail shortly.   \\nFor the full year, our net income was up nearly 40% to $12.7 billion.  We exceeded our full -year revenue target \\nwith revenues up 5% ex -divestitures.  Fee revenue was up 17% and we saw a smaller impact from Argentina’s \\ncurrency devaluation. We delivered exp enses within our guidance and improved our efficiency ratio by 340 \\nbps whilst increasing investment in our Transformation .  Our RoTCE  grew over 200 bps, albeit from a low \\nlevel.  Our five core businesses each generated positive operating leverage for the fu ll year, which we also \\nachieved at the firm level.  \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Fourth  Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nJanuary  15, 202 5 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 5 Citigroup Inc.   2 \\n Services was up 9% and had another record year, despite the lower rate environment, as a result of new \\nmandates and our emphasis on fee growth. We grew share in both TTS and Securities Services.  \\nCapped by our best fourth quarter in a decade, Markets was up 6%.  The performance of this franchise in a \\nlow -volatility year shows the benefits of our diversified product mix.   \\nEquities was strong throughout and was up 26% in what was a record year for us.  \\nBanking was up 32% as we gained share across all three investment banking products.  And we announced \\nan innovative $25 billion private credit partnership with our longtime client Apollo. Under Vis’ leadership, we \\nexpect to continue to gain on our competit ion in 2025 and beyond.   \\n2024 was the turning point for Wealth, as we sharpened our focus on investments, right -sized the expense \\nbase, and improved the client experience.  Revenue was up 7% for the year, including fee growth of 18%. \\nCitigold and Asia were particularly strong and Net New Investment Asset flows grew a very pleasing 40%. \\nWe attracted top talent throughout the year in Wealth, most recently bringing in Kate Moore as our CIO and \\nAnne McCosker as our Head of Lending.  This business has tremendous potential with both new and existing \\nclients, and we are really leaning into it.  \\nUSPB revenues were up 6% driven by borrowing across both card portfolios and by fee growth.  We \\nannounced a 10 -year extension of our co -branded partnership with American Airlines, ensuring that this \\nvaluable relationship enters into its fifth decade.  With  the acquisition of the Barclays portfolio, we will \\nbecome A merican Airlines ’ exclusive partner in 2026 and we expect to deliver more value for our cardholders \\nand higher returns for our shareholders as a result.  \\nWe grew our Tangible Book Value per share by 4% and ended 2024 with a CET1 Ratio of 13.6%, approximately \\n150 basis points above our regulatory capital requirement.        \\nAfter repurchasing $1 billion in common shares during the fourth quarter, we returned almost $7 billion in \\ncapital to our common shareholders in 2024.  Given how committed we are to returning capital, I  am \\nparticularly pleased to announce that our Board authorized a $20 billion share repurchase program.   \\nYou can see the very tangible progress we are making in executing the strategy that we laid out at our Investor \\nDay three years ago.  We have materially simplified our firm since then.  We exited consumer businesses in \\nnine countries, and near completion o f our wind -downs in three and are on track to exit the final two.  This \\nincludes Banamex, which we legally separated from our institutional business in December.  We are now fully \\nfocused on getting ready to IPO, with the timing heavily dependent on regula tory approvals and market \\nconditions of course.  \\nTo align our structure with our strategy, we went through a significant simplification of our organization, \\nremoving management layers and the regional construct.  This has accelerated decision making and made \\nus a better partner to our clients.  \\nWe have strengthened our culture by better aligning compensation with our shareholders’ interests, \\nenhancing our scorecards to ensure we are delivering for clients. We attracted top industry talent throughout \\nour organization and that includes new leaders around my table for Banking, Wealth and Technology.   We \\nhave raised the bar on what we demand from each other and what we expect to deliver to our clients.  \\nWe have continued to innovate to improve the client experience and our efficiency.  We are now live with Citi \\nPayments Express in 18 countries, and have converted four million retail bank customers to our Simplified \\nBanking platform in the U.S.  We acceler ated our use of AI, arming 30,000 developers with tools to write \\ncode and launched two AI platforms to make 143,000 colleagues more efficient.  \\nThe investments we’re making to modernize our infrastructure, streamline processes and automate controls \\nare changing how we run the bank. We consolidated our balance sheet reporting to one unified ledger.   We \\nimplemented a cloud -based solution for risk a nalytics to better value trading assets. We have closed out \\nthree long -standing consent orders. Our capital, liquidity and reserves are robust.  Our focused strategy, \\nsimpler structure and targeted client selection have all reduced our risk profile signifi cantly.   \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Fourth  Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nJanuary  15, 202 5 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 5 Citigroup Inc.   3 \\n We have made considerable progress on our Transformation .  While there are areas that are more advanced, \\nthere are others where we still have a lot more work to do, particularly around data and regulatory reporting, \\nas last summer’s regulatory actions reinforced. We have reviewed the entire data program and mad e changes \\nto its governance and structure as well as increased the level of investment.    \\nAs CEO, I want this company set up for long -term success and to ensure that we have enough capacity to \\ninvest for that.  In terms of expense guidance therefore, most of the saves from the org simplification and \\nstranded costs will be used to fund the addit ional investments we need to make this year in both \\nTransformation  and technology. As a result, we expect our total expenses in 2025 to be slightly below the \\n2024 level and to deliver another year of positive operating leverage.  We expect our elevated exp ense level \\nto be temporary and for it to keep coming down beyond 2025.   \\nHowever, when we take the required investments into account, we now expect our 2026 RoTCE  to be \\nbetween 10% and 11%. The 2026 RoTCE  is a waypoint; it is not a destination.  Our intention is to continue to \\nimprove returns well above that level and we are accountable for doing so.  We are relentless in our \\ndetermination to run the bank more efficiently, fulfill Citi’s potential and meet  the expectations of our \\nshareholders.  \\nBefore I turn it over to Mark, I’d like to acknowledge the catastrophic wildfires in Los Angeles. Many of our \\nclients and several of our colleagues have lost their homes and we will do whatever we can to help them \\nrecover from this devastating event.  They  and their loved ones are in all of our thoughts at Citi.  \\nNow, over to Mark.  \\nMARK MASON : Thanks, Jane and good morning, everyone. I am going to start with the fourth quarter and \\nfull-year financial results, focusing on year -over -year comparisons unless I indicate otherwise. I’ll also focus \\non our current expectations for 2025 and 2026.  \\nOn slide 7, we show financial results for the full firm, which reflect improved performance both in the quarter \\nand the year. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of last year, revenues were significantly impacted by \\nArgentina currency devaluation. Adjuste d revenues and non -interest revenues for the full firm and Services \\nare shown in the appendix of the earnings presentation on slide 36.  This quarter we reported net income of \\n$2.9 billion, EPS of $1.34 and an RoTCE  of 6.1% on $19.6 billion of revenues, generating positive operating \\nleverage for the firm and in each of our businesses.  Total revenues were up 12%, driven by growth in each of \\nour businesses and a smaller impact of Argentina currency devaluation.  Net interest income excluding \\nMarkets was roughly flat, with growth in USPB and Wealth offset by declines in Corporate /Other and \\nBanking. Non -interest revenue excluding Markets was up 40%, driven by continued strong fee momentum \\nacross Services, Banking and Wealt h along with lower partner payments in USPB as well as a smaller impact \\nof Argentina currency devaluation.  And total Markets revenues were up 36%.  Expenses were $13.2 billion, \\ndown 18%, largely driven by the absence of the FDIC special assessment and restructuring charge in the prior \\nyear. Excluding the impact of the FDIC special assessment and divestiture -related impacts, expenses were \\ndown 7%, driv en by the absence of the restructuring charge in the prior year and savings associated with our \\norganizationa l simplification, partially offset by higher volume related expenses.  Cost of credit was $2.6 \\nbillion, largely consisting of cards’ net credit losses and ACL build. At the end of the quarter, we had over $22 \\nbillion in total reserves with a reserve -to-funded loans ratio of 2.7%. And on a full -year basis, we delivered \\n$12.7 billion of net income with an RoTCE  of 7.0%.  \\nOn slide 8, we show full year revenue trends by business from 2021 to 2024. This year, we delivered $81.1 \\nbillion of revenue, up 5% on an ex -divestiture basis, driven by growth in each of our businesses and a smaller \\nimpact of Argentina currency devaluatio n. Services revenues increased 9% to $19.6 billion, benefiting from \\na smaller impact of Argentina currency devaluation, fee growth and higher deposit volumes. Markets \\nrevenues increased 6% to $19.8 billion, primarily driven by growth in Equities, which had  its highest annual \\nrevenue in a decade, and Spread Products. Banking revenues increased 32% to $6.2 billion, largely driven by \\ngrowth in Investment Banking, with fees up 42% as we gained approximately 50 basis points of share on an \\nincreased wallet. Wealt h revenues increased 7% to $7.5 billion, primarily driven by a 15% increase in non -\\ninterest revenue as we continue to grow client investment assets. USPB revenues increased 6% to $20.4 \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Fourth  Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nJanuary  15, 202 5 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 5 Citigroup Inc.   4 \\n billion, driven by growth in cards, as we continue to see strong customer engagement and an increase in \\ninterest -earning balances, as well as lower partner payments.  Overall, this year demonstrates another year \\nof performance consistent with our medium -term target of 4 to 5% annual growth and the value of our \\ndiversified business model.  \\nOn slide 9, we show the full year expense trend from 2021 to 2024. Excluding the impact of the FDIC special \\nassessment, our full -year expenses were $53.8 billion, in line with our target. Expense reduction was driven \\nby savings related to our organizationa l simplification and stranded cost reduction, as well as lower \\nrestructuring and repositioning charges. Organizational simplification, stranded cost reduction as well as \\nefforts to drive efficiencies across the businesses contributed to a net decline of ro ughly 10 thousand direct \\nstaff.  These savings were mostly offset by higher volume -related expenses as well as investments in the \\nTransformation  and other risk and controls and the Civil Money Penalties.  As you can see at the bottom of \\nthe page, we spent $2.9 billion on Transformation  this year, which includes investments in our \\ninfrastructure, platforms, applications, and data. Transformation  investments were up 1%, driven by an \\nincrease in certain programs, including data, largely offset by a reduction in the Transformation  Bonus \\nAward.  And we spent $11.8 billion on technology, focused on digital innovation, new product development, \\nclient experience and other areas such as cyber security.  \\nTurning to slide 10, we provide details on our $2.4 trillion balance sheet, which decreased 3% sequentially, \\nlargely driven by the impact of foreign exchange translation.  In the fourth quarter, we deployed some of our \\nexcess liquidity into loans, while maintaining a 116% LCR and $933 billion of available liquidity resources.  \\nOur $1.3 trillion deposit base remains well -diversified across regions, industries, customers and account \\ntypes.  We maintained strong capital, ending the year with a preliminary 13.6% C ET1 Capital ratio, \\napproximately 150 basis points above our regulatory capital requirement of 12.1%.  And for the year we \\nreturned nearly $7 billion in the form of common dividends and repurchases to our shareholders.  Turning to \\nthe businesses on slide 11, we show the results for Services for the fourth quarter and full year. Services \\nrevenues were up 15%, driven by a smaller impact of Argentina currency devaluation and reflecting continued \\nmomentum across Securities Se rvices and TTS, both of which gained sh are this year.  NIR increased 61%, \\ndriven by a smaller impact of Argentina currency devaluation, as well as continued strength in underlying fee \\ndrivers such as USD Clearing, Commercial Card spend, Cross Border transactions, and assets under custody \\nand administration. NI I was roughly flat, as the benefit of higher deposit volumes was offset by the impact \\nof lower interest rates in Argentina.  Expenses increased 1%, driven by continued investment in technology \\nand platform modernization, partially offset by p roductivity savings. Cost of credit was $112 million with a \\nnet ACL build of $84 million and net credit losses of $28 million.  Average loans increased 5% primarily driven \\nby continued demand for export and agency finance as well as working capital loans. Average deposits \\nincreased 4% as we continue to see growth in operating deposits.  Services generated positive operating \\nleverage and delivered net income of $1.9 billion and $6.5 billion for the year. And continues to deliver a high \\nRoTCE , coming in at 29.9 % and 26.0% for the year.  \\nOn slide 12, we show the results for Markets for the fourth quarter and full year. Markets saw its highest \\nfourth quarter revenue in a decade and increased 36% with broad based gains across all products.  Fixed \\nIncome revenues increased 37%, driven by Rates and Currencies, which were up 39%, and Spread Products \\nand Other Fixed Income, up 30%, both reflecting increased client activity.  Rates and Currencies also \\nbenefitted from a conducive trading environment, compared to a challenging prior year quarter.  Spre ad \\nProducts and Other Fixed Income was driven by Credit and Mortgage Trading as well as higher securitization \\nvolumes.  Equities revenues increased 34%, driven in part by strong execution of strategic client transactions \\nin Cash Equities.  And momentum also continued in Prime, with balances up approximately 23%.  Expenses \\ndecreased 8%, primarily driven by lower legal expenses and productivity savings. Cost of credit was $134 \\nmillion, driven by a net ACL build, primarily related to Spread Products.  Average loans increased 6%, primarily \\ndriven by asset -backed lending in Spread Products as well as margin loans in Equities. Aver age trading \\naccount assets increased 15%, largely driven by client demand for US Treasuries and foreign government \\nsecurities.  Markets generated another quarter of positive operating leverage and delivered net income of \\n$1.0 billion and $4.9 billion for the year. And delivered an RoTCE  of 7.4% and 9.1% for the year.  \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Fourth  Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nJanuary  15, 202 5 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 5 Citigroup Inc.   5 \\n On slide 13, we show the results for Banking for the fourth quarter and full year. Banking revenues were up \\n27%, largely driven by Investment Banking, with fees up 35% as we saw growth across all products.  DCM \\nwas driven by continued Investment Grade issuance momentum and increased Leveraged Finance activity. \\nECM saw strong issuance activity particularly in follow -on and convertible instruments.  In M&A, growth was \\ndriven by continued strong client engagemen t as well as the completion of previously announce d \\nacquisitions, given the more conducive macro environment. For the year, we gained share across regions, \\nproducts and several sectors, including Healthcare and Technology.  Corporate Lending revenues, excluding \\nmark -to-market on loan hedges, decreased 24%, driven by lower revenue share and volumes, partially offset \\nby a smaller impact of Argentina currency devaluation.  Expenses decreased 9%, primarily driven by benefits \\nof headcount reduction as we right sized the workforce and expense base, partially offse t by higher volume -\\nrelated expenses. Cost of credit was a benefit of $240 million, driven by a net ACL release of $247 million, \\nprimarily driven by improved macroeconomic conditions.  Banking generated positive operating leverage for \\nthe fourth quarter in a row and delivered net income of $356 million and $1.5 billion for the year. And \\ndelivered an RoTCE  of 6.5% and 7.0% for the year.  \\nOn slide 14, we show the results for Wealth for the fourth quarter and full year. As you can see from our \\nperformance this quarter, we are making good progress against our strategy and expect that momentum to \\ncontinue. Revenues were up 20%, driven by a 22%  increase in NIR as we grew investment fees, with client \\ninvestment assets up 18%, including net new investment assets of $16 billion. NII increased 20%, driven by \\nhigher average deposit spreads and volumes.  Expenses decreased 3%, driven by the continued b enefit of \\nheadcount reductions as we right size the workforce and expense base. End -of-period client balances \\nincreased 8%, driven by higher client investment asset flows and market valuations. Average deposits \\nincreased 3%, reflecting the transfer of rela tionships and the associated deposits from USPB, partially offset \\nby a shift in deposits to higher -yielding investments on Citi’s platform. Average loans decreased 1%, as we \\ncontinued to optimize capital usage.  Wealth generated a pre -tax margin of 21% and another quarter of \\npositive operating leverage, delivering net income of $334 million and $1.0 billion for the year. And delivered \\nan RoTCE  of 10.1% and 7.6% for the year.  \\nOn slide 15, we show the results for U .S. Personal Banking for the fourth quarter and full year. U .S. Personal \\nBanking revenues were up 6%, driven by NII growth of 5% and lower partner payments.  Branded Cards \\nrevenues increased 7%, with interest -earning balance growth of 7% as payment rates continue to normalize \\nand we continue to see spend growth, which was up 5%. Retail Services revenues increased 7%, driven by \\nlower partner payments and interes t-earning balance growth of 3%. And Retail Banking revenues w ere \\nroughly flat, as the impact of higher deposit spreads was offset by the impact of the transfer of relationships \\nand the associated deposits to our Wealth business.  Expenses decreased 2%, driven by continued \\nproductivity savings, partially offset by higher volume -related expenses. Cost of credit was $2.2 billion, \\nlargely driven by net credit losses, as well as a build primarily for volume growth.  Average deposits decreased \\n18%, largely driven by the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits t o our Wealth business. USPB \\ngenerated another quarter of positive operating leverage and delivered net income of $392 million and $1.4 \\nbillion for the year. And delivered an RoTCE  of 6.2% and 5.5% for the year.  \\nOn slide 16, we show results for All Other on a managed basis, which includes Corporate /Other and Legacy \\nFranchises and excludes divestiture -related items. Revenues decreased 34%, primarily driven by net \\ninvestment securities losses as we repositioned the portfolio, higher funding costs and closed exits and \\nwind -downs.  Expenses decreased 51%, primarily driven by the absence of the FDIC special assessment and \\nrestructuring charge in the prior year, as well as the reduction from the closed exits and wind -down s. And \\ncost of credit was $397 million, with net credit losses of $257 million and a net ACL build of $140 million, \\nprimarily driven by Mexico.   \\nTurning to slide 18, where I will walk you through our current expectations for 2025. As a reminder, what \\nunderpins our current expectations is a reflection of a number of scenarios that include different macro and \\ncapital market environments.  And based o n what we know today, we expect revenues to be around $83.5 \\nto $84.5 billion, a roughly 3 to 4% increase year -over -year.  We expect a continuation of the NIR ex -Markets \\nmomentum we saw this year, driven by: Investment Banking, as we continue to gain share i n areas of \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Fourth  Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nJanuary  15, 202 5 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 5 Citigroup Inc.   6 \\n strategic focus – such as Healthcare, Technology as well as Leveraged Finance and Sponsors – assuming a \\nconstructive industry wallet.  Wealth, supported by a continued focus on growth in client investment assets \\nand banker productivity, which will drive investment revenue.  Services, as we execute the strategy we laid \\nout at our Investor Day in June – expanding our leadership position with large institutions and growing our \\nmarket share with Commercial clients in TTS. And in Securities Services, continuing to  gain share through \\ninvestments in our digital and data capabilities while deepening with asset managers and asset owners.  \\nTurning to slide 19, we expect NII ex -Markets to be up modestly this year. However, there are several \\ntailwinds and headwinds that I will walk you through. Looking at the lefthand side of the page, we expect \\nmost of the increase to come from volume growth and mix, primarily driven by higher loan volumes in USPB, \\nmainly in cards, and deposit volumes in Services.  We expect a continued benefit from lower yielding \\ninvestment securities rolling off and being repriced into higher yielding assets such as cash, loa ns, and \\nsecurities.  Partially offsetting these tailwinds are several headwinds, including various scenarios around: \\nLower rates, both in US and non -US, which we expect to be mostly offset by repricing actions across the \\nfranchise. As well as the potential impact of card late fee reduction and FX.  \\nTurning to slide 20, we expect expenses to be slightly lower than $53.8 billion for 2025. Our expectations \\nreflect continued benefits from our organizational simplification, reduction in stranded costs and \\nproductivity savings from our prior investments. H owever, offsetting most of these benefits are increased \\ninvestments in the Transformation , technology and the businesses as well as higher volume -related \\nexpenses. Embedded in our outlook for the year is roughly $600 million for repositioning, which remain s \\nelevated, as we continue to reduce stranded costs, drive efficiencies across the businesses and as benefits \\nfrom investments in Transformation  and technology allow us to eliminate manual processes.  As Jane said, \\nwe recognize that our expense base remains elevated. And we remain very focused on bringing down our \\nexpenses each year while ensuring that we have enough capacity to invest in the company.  \\nNow turning to slide 21, I’ll talk through our expectations for returns going forward.  As we enter 2025 and \\nthink forward to 2026, we continue to have a clear path to improved returns.  Having gone through another \\nrobust planning process, and having provided revenue and expense targets for 2025, we want to update our \\n2026 RoTCE  target range.  In 2026 we expect continued revenue growth from both NII and NIR with drivers \\nlargely consistent with recent performance.  We expect expenses to decline from 2025 and ar e targeting an \\nexpense level below $53 billion. The reduction in our expense base will come from a decrease in legacy and \\nstranded costs, a more normalized level of severance, and an increase in productivity savings from our prior \\ninvestments. We will main tain strict discipline on the entire expense base, looking for more opportunities to \\ndrive further efficiencies as we go into 2026.  We also remain laser focused on continuing to optimize RWA \\nbut as you know, the future of capital rules and therefore requi rements remain uncertain. In light of all of this, \\nwe are now targeting an RoTCE  in the range of 10 to 11% in 2026.  We are committed to driving positive \\noperating leverage and improving our returns every year for both the firm and the businesses, and we will do \\nso in a sustainable way which will set this company up for long -term success.  With that in mind, as part of \\nthe $20 billion share repurchase program, we plan on buying back $1.5 billion of common stock in the first \\nquarter.  As we take a step back, 20 24 represents another year of solid progress and a set of proof points \\ntowards improving firmwide and business performance, as well as continued execution against our \\nTransformation . And as we enter 2025, these priorities remain critical as we continue to make progress on \\nimproving our returns.  \\nWith that, Jane and I will be happy to take your questions.  \\nOPERATOR:  Our first question will come from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is now open. Please \\ngo ahead.   \\nJIM MITCHELL: Hey, good morning  everyone. Just I think as Jane noted, it seems like a material driver of the \\nreduction in the RoTCE  target in 202 6 is expenses. I think you kind of backed off the lower end of that, given \\nhigher investments in the Transformation  but also talked about it being somewhat temporary. We \\nappreciate the below $53 billion  for 202 6, but how much more is there to go beyond that in terms of \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Fourth  Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nJanuary  15, 202 5 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 5 Citigroup Inc.   7 \\n eliminating parallel systems, running parallel systems, reduced consultant spend and all that stuff. Is there \\nstill that path to a 60% or lower efficiency ratio ? Thanks.   \\nJANE FRASER:  Happy New Year, Jim. I know you want to talk about the guidance, so let me put it into context \\nhere. Last year, you've heard me be very clear about our two  priorities. First one is driving the business \\nperformance and the second is executing the Transformation . You've seen this quarter , you've seen last \\nquarter, you've seen the full year our businesses are delivering the progress we wanted them to. The strategy \\nis working. We've changed the business mix. We're generating more fee -based revenues . You see that in \\nServices with NIR up 37% this year , Wealth NIR up 15%, IB  fees  up 35%, an important part of the mix around \\nthe quality of our earnings.    \\nWe said Services as a crown jewel. It's delivered growth, high returns, it's taken share. It's a crown jewel. We \\nmade a strategic play in Wealth, and you've seen us very steadily prove out why we can be a force globally \\nwith a clear path to delivering the financial performance that we said we would do. We've consistently \\ndelivered on our revenue and expense targets. And I see a lot more opp ortunity and more upside to \\nstrengthen our business performance. We're very tangibly getting after it. We're pretty exc ited by it.    \\nThe second priority, Transformation . I've got to tell you, I'm broadly pleased with the progress we've made in \\nrisk and compliance and accountability. Kind of excited by the work we've got going on in controls for the \\nbusiness as well at the moment. We've been very transparent. Data is an a rea we have more work to do in. \\nWe increased our investments last year, as you know. And then as part of the annual planning process, we \\ntook a big step back to reassess our plan. And I decided, along with Mark and the ma nagement team, we \\nneeded to expand the scope and accelerate some of the work to satisfy our regulators' expectations.    \\nI'm confident that the decision to do that, it was the right one. It's the right one for our Transformation  efforts , \\nit’s certainly the right one for the firm overall. I could have taken a short -term decision to cut other \\ninvestments that are important for our long -term competitiveness , I'm just not going to do that. You \\nshouldn't want me to do that. And as I said in the opening comments, this 202 6 target is a waypoint, not the \\nfinal destination.   \\nMARK MASON: I just want to address the second part of your question, Jim, in terms of the path to the less \\nthan 60%. I think Jane framed it out quite nicely in that we're building a franchise that will have continued \\nand sustainable top line revenue momentum. We are focused on driving out the inefficiencies and stranded \\ncosts and Legacy Franchise expenses from the organization and the benefits from these investments we've \\nmade in the Transformation  will yield a lower cost structure over time as well. And so  the combination of \\nthose things will get us to that targeted operating efficiency as we come out of 2026 at less than 60%. So \\nyes, there is still a path, and we are focused on that path.   \\nJIM MITCHELL:  Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And then just maybe pivoting to the buyback , great to see \\nthe $20 billion authorization. Obviously, I can't help but ask about beyond 1Q. If we do sort of get this more \\ncertainty maybe no increase in capital requirements, does that start to help you maybe at least temporarily \\nlower the buffer to tak e advantage of , you ’re trading below  tangible book and getting the accretion and \\naccelerating the buyback? Or how do you think about the rest of the year on the buy backs?   \\nMARK MASON: Look, I'll make a couple of comments. So one, we're very pleased to have announced the \\nbuyback program at $20 billion. I think, in many ways, that is a demonstration, if you will, of continued \\nconfidence in the earnings generation and momentum that we have  around that as well as the recognition \\nthat we are trading below book and not where we want to be. And you've heard both Jane and I speak to the \\nimportance of increasing and doing more in the way of buybacks. We've increased that  to $1.5 billi on. I think \\nthat supports that same degree of confidence that we have in the momentum. We are constantly looking at \\nevery year on an annual basis as we go through our planning process at the management buffer that we have \\nof 100 basis points.    \\nAnd despite the last couple of quarters at running above the 13.1%, our target is the 13.1%. And so as we go \\nthrough the balance of the year, as we get clarity on reg rules and what have you, you'll see us continue to \\nmanage down to that 13.1%  and obviousl y, the two  important characteristics that we keep in mind is the \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Fourth  Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nJanuary  15, 202 5 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 5 Citigroup Inc.   8 \\n opportunity to invest more in the business at accretive returns, and where we're trading and the need to do \\nmore buybacks in order to reflect the underlying value. So target is 13.1%. We continue to look at that \\nmanagement buffer as the regulatory environm ent evolves. And we'll continue to do more in the way of \\ncapital actions as that makes sense.   \\nOPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Truist Securities. Your line is now \\nopen, please go ahead.   \\nJOHN MCDONALD: Thank you. Mark, just wanted to follow up on your answer to Jim right there. So when \\nyou look at the 10 % to 11 % RoTCE  target for 2026. Is that kind of assuming you'll be around the target or like \\nusing the 13.1% as the target? And then longer term, you hope to bring that target down as rules get clarified \\nand the franchise gets simplified?   \\nMARK MASON: Hey John, good to hear from you. In fact, yes, the 10% to 11% RoTCE  target we've set for 202 6 \\ndoes assume that we are running and using a 13.1% CET1 ratio obviously, there'll be an SCB that comes out \\nsometime later this year. The rules are continuing to evolve and what have you, and we'll factor those in as \\nwe know more about them. But yes, it do es assume the 13.1% which is our management target, if you will, for \\nCET1.   \\nJOHN MCDONALD:  Okay. Great. And then my next question is, could you clarify what you're expecting this \\nyear for card net charge -offs ? Understand the quarterly cadence has seasonality. But for the full year, it \\nsounds like you're expecting the charge -offs to be in the range of last year's guidance. Can you just kind of \\nclarify that? And then maybe just talk about provision build, which you  had a lot of in 2024 and whether that \\ncould slow down as the maturation of balances slow s down? Thank you.   \\nMARK MASON:  Sure. So in terms of the net credit losses and the forecast that we have, we are expecting \\nthat the net credit losses will be at the high end of the range that we've given. So in the case of Branded Cards, \\nthat 3.5% to 4% is the full year range that we've given . In the case of Retail Services, it's 5.75% to 6.25%, \\nexcuse me, and so right now, Retail Services is at that high end at  6.28%  for 2024. We'd expect it to stay at \\nthat high end, and then on Branded Cards, we're at 3.64%, we'd expect it t o creep up to about the 4% level \\nover the course of the year. But remember, that is a full year NCL rate, and we know that there's seasonality \\nthrough the quarters. And so you'll see movement through the quarters based on that dynamic.    \\nAnd then just in terms of the provision build, there are a couple of drivers there. One is obviously volume, and \\nwe do expect to see volume growth in USPB. So that will be an important factor in how the CECL calculations \\nare done. And then the second drive r is obviously, as you know, we run models and the models they have a \\nbase scenario , they have a downside , an upside scenario depending on the broader macro factors, \\nunemployment, GDP, et cetera, et cetera, and our weighting towards the likelihood of high or upside or \\ndownside scenario, those factors become important considerations in the provisioning. And so that's kind \\nof how we think about that going into 202 5. I hope that helps.   \\nOPERATOR:  Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open, please go \\nahead.   \\nMIKE MAYO: Hi, just a clarification. So you are guiding for three consecutive years of lower expenses \\nincluding that $600 million repositioning this year. So they were down in 202 4, you're guiding them lower in \\n202 5 and you guide them lower in 202 6 again, and you're also guiding for three consecutive years of higher \\nrevenues based on what you said. I didn't see that in the written materials, but I think I heard you say that, \\nMark. So three years of lower expenses, three years of higher revenues to at least 202 6. Is that correct?   \\nMARK MASON:  Yes, that is correct. I think you described it correctly. We're seeing continued momentum on \\nthe top line. and we're focused on continuing to bring our expenses down just as we did in 202 4, a tad bit in \\n202 5 and then more in 202 6.  \\nMIKE MAYO:  All right. And then I guess this is for Jane. Well, that beats haggis on toast, if you achieve that. \\nBut I'm wondering why that efficiency might not improve even more. I mean if you have $5 billion of stranded \\ncost s and Transformation  costs in 2024 and some of that goes down. I heard you're investing in tech and \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Fourth  Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nJanuary  15, 202 5 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 5 Citigroup Inc.   9 \\n Transformation  and volume and the businesses. And there's always a trade -off between the bottom line \\nresults you showed today and the growth you show in the future, and it seems like you're going to get this \\ndone, the lower expenses while you're leaning into a little bi t extra growth. So talk about that trade -off and \\nwhere you're leaning in for growth a little bit more.   \\nJANE FRASER: First of all, I'm a little disturbed by your comment about haggis on toast. It's haggis with \\nmashed potatoes and whiskey, just to be clear for everyone. It's Robert Burns night coming up soon. On \\nexpenses, Mike and everyone , expenses are a focus not just for Mark and I , but for the entire management \\nteam. We're making sure that focus and discipline is really getting installed and instilled into the DNA of Citi. \\nAnd you've seen that, as you referenced, we've been meeting our expense guidance over the last couple of \\nyears , we've been driving positive operating efficiency .   \\nWe're all very focused on improving our operating expense base. Consolidating technology, the \\nsimplification work, automation, getting different utilities put in place rather than fragmented around the \\nfirm , using AI tools now our , location strategy, right? So that core operating expense base is something that \\nwe're really looking at how do we drive to be more efficient, more modern and getting it to the level it should \\nbe for the revenues that we generate. We all want Transformation  to get done quickly, an d we want it to get \\ndone right. So that is why our expenses are temporarily elevated to make the investments that needed there. \\nThis is not all run rate.    \\nAnd as you say, as CEO, I will not sacrifice the right long -term investments in our growth and \\ncompetitiveness for short -term expediency. This is a way point. It's not a destination. And we know what we \\nneed to do. We've got our arms around all of this, we 're just getting on with execution.   \\nOPERATOR:  Our next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is \\nnow open, please go ahead.   \\nBETSY GRASECK: Hi good morning. Jane, just to follow up on what you mentioned, as you do execute, we all \\nexpect , or at least I do, that the market will be giving you credit for that execution , and meaning multiples \\nshould increase. I have a few questions here on the buyback , because right now , today, as we all know, you're \\ntrading below book, it has got to be, buying back stock has got to be the most accretive use of capital today. \\nAnd why wait on the buyback when you can lean into it today and keep your 2026 guide, I mean, the old \\nguide was 11 % to 12% RoTCE , new guide, 10% to 11%.    \\nI'm kind of confused why you don't pull that lever more aggressively because buying back the stock, the \\naccretion to tangible book, it’s got to be the easiest thing to do to help that RoTCE  go up. When you compare \\nand contrast against all the hard work you've been doing, which will obviously be very important to getting \\nthe RoTCE  up. But why not lean more into that buyback? And can you give us a sense of the timing of that \\n$20 billion ? Thank you.   \\nJANE FRASER:  Yes, Betsy, I love the passion. I've got to say I can hear the determination in your voice. I think \\nit's the same determination we feel. Look, we're very committed to returning capital shareholders period . Full \\nstop. We’ve got a $20 billion buyback program, as Mark said, that is reflective of the growing earnings power \\nthat we have and our confidence in the path ahead. We've been increasing the amount of capital return over \\nthe last few quarters. I'm also happy to see a more aggressive Basel II I scenario firmly off the table.    \\nWe have, nonetheless, a 13.1%  CET 1 ratio that we put in the plan that can change over time as well. But there's \\nnot , there's not complete certainty around where the capital requirements are going to go. We hope there \\nwill be a holistic one that is reflective of the risk profile of the bank that's been improving significantly over \\nthe last few years. So we have some grea t growth opportunities. I look at the different areas. I'm excited by \\nwhat we see in Wealth. We've got a great runway with our clients who want to do business with us in \\nBank ing.    \\nWe've got some very important investments and an investment agenda that we're putting in to help us \\ncontinue growing the bank, gaining competitiveness in a responsible way. I'll just conclude with exactly your \\npoint. The bar is high on those investments. W e don't make them unless we see extremely attractive marginal \\nRoTCE . And there's a lot of things we say no to in order to put the $20 billion program in place. In terms of \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Fourth  Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nJanuary  15, 202 5 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 5 Citigroup Inc.   10 \\n timing, like our peers, we're not committing to a particular time frame from this, but you can see our \\ncommitment. You can hear our commitment.   \\nOPERATOR:  Our next question will come from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank America. Your line \\nis now open, please go ahead.   \\nEBRAHIM POONAWALA:  I guess maybe, Jane, I wanted to follow up on a couple of segments. I think you said \\n2024 turning point for Wealth , and we've seen very steady progress on the RoTCE  in Wealth. Just talk to us \\nin terms of, Andy Sieg’s being  in the seat for a year now, you've seen progress. What needs to happen? Just \\ntalk to us a little bit about the franchise positioning competitively both in the U.S. and abroad as you think \\nabout going head -to-head with some of your global competitors and where are the mo st likely growth \\nopportunities over the next year or two ?  \\nJANE FRASER: Yes. So , our vision, my vision is that we become a global leader in wealth management. There \\nare not many firms that have the globality of Citi. We have all the assets, especially the client relationships \\nall around the world, which were just not tapped for investments in the past. It's a big opportunity. We have \\n$5.3 trillion “off us” from existing clients. And I think the fact that I would find interesting is 55% of it, it's \\nalmost $3 trillion with affluent clients in our branch network in Am erica , in the U.S.    \\nWe're also very well -positioned to capture new wealth, just think about what Citi does in terms of our \\nfootprint, our capabilities really supports the wealth creation , from the Commercial Bank, our Investment \\nBanking side , Markets, obviously, Services supporting it, too. These are all great feeders for us to strengthen \\nwealth relationships with our clients.  \\nSo we brought in Andy. Andy greatly sharpened the focus on the investment business , this is where we see \\nthe big upside. He's been building a differentiated value proposition around wealth creation.   He’s been \\nleveraging a lot of the leading capital market capabilities, the different relationships we have with PE firms, \\nasset managers around the world. Get a great platform in place and importantly, improving our client \\nexperience, again, particularly around  investments, asset allocation, performance, et cet era. What I have \\nalso got to love is the surgical approach that he's taking to the expense base and driving productivity, \\nsomething that we're doing across the firm. I'm also excited by the talent he's bringing , in the market leaders \\nlike Kate Moore and Keith Glenfield in the investment space.   And we've made a lot of investments in training  \\nand  building this investment culture that we didn't have before.  \\nSo to your point, the proof points are working. Q4 revenue up 20%, operating margin at 21% on its way to \\n25% to 30%, 10% RoTCE  on its way to 15% to 20%. These last few quarters, you've just seen us on that march. \\nAnd the number I'm most excited by , net new investment asset inflow of $42 billion, up 40% year -over -year. \\nThe strategy is working. We're going to be a leader in wealth, the growth opportunities , Asia U.S., Middle East, \\nall the places where we are with our existing clients and the new wealth generators of the future.   \\nEBRAHIM POONAWALA:  And if I can draw a parallel to the Banking segment with the RoTCE  is about 5% to \\n6% last few quarters. There you brought in Vis Raghavan from JPMorgan. Just give us a sense of could we see \\na similar trajectory in that business over the next 12 months and where the opportunities are to improve that \\nROE ? \\nJANE FRASER:  Yes. I think absolutely, a strong performance , the strategy we have in place is delivering nicely. \\nSo if you look at the revenues, the investment banking fees, positive operating leverage all through the year \\nand gaining share. All three products gaining share in all three in all of the geographies we're in, I'm really \\nexcited and happy to see the health care and technology , two areas that we've been investing heavily behind. \\nAnd you're also seeing us playing a leading role in some of the key t ransactions, the biggest transactions last \\nyear . Mars Kellanova, single adviser, big role in Boeing , and then just this week, the J&J acquisition of \\nIntracellular.  So the deals that matter, this is where you're seeing Citi playing a leading role in.  \\nSo when Vis joined, the mandate , a bit similar to Andy , becoming a top three investment bank, deliver the \\nfull potential of One Citi to our clients. So we've got a lot of upside there, instilling some more discipline in \\ncapital allocation, client coverage, some of the cross -firm linkages. We're getting a lot more from our people. \\nWe've been bringing in some great new talent we've a lso been cutting some of the unproductive spend. So I \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Fourth  Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nJanuary  15, 202 5 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 5 Citigroup Inc.   11 \\n think what you can see is we're just on a path of systematically growing our wallet. We'll be improving our \\noperating margin, generating higher returns. That should be your expectation over the next couple of years \\nof what you'll see from us.  And as we head into great environment in 2025 that should be pretty conducive \\nfor a lot of client activity. I'm very confident we're well positioned. We've got the groundwork done to  take \\nadvantage of it.   \\nMARK MASON: Ebrahim, I thought I heard you say R oTCE of 5%. It's actually 7% for the full year for Banking \\nand on its way to the target that we've set of mid -teens for our Banking business.   \\nOPERATOR:  Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is now open, please \\ngo ahead.   \\nERIKA NAJARIAN: Thank you.  Hate to ask the umpteenth question on the buyback, but clearly, the way the \\nstock is reacting today, the buyback is very important to your shareholders. I guess my first question, if I \\ncould have the two  questions , is it's very clear that you want to return capital to shareholders. It's very clear \\nthat you have excess capital. It's very clear that your PPNR trajectory is positive. And so what are the specific \\nmile markers that that Citi needs to see in order to incr ease that pacing  from that $1.5 billion a quarter to \\nsomething is more suggestive of a pace that that would be in line with that $20 billion authorization ? And I \\nknow that's been asked of you already, but is it the consent order? Is it the stress test? We had  some news \\nover the holidays that were positive for the sector. Like what are those specific mile markers? I mean you're \\ndoing it on the PPNR side, right? Like what do you need to see to have even more confiden ce, again, like \\nleaning into Betsy’s words , to go all in on the buyback?   \\nMARK MASON:  Yes. So thank you for the question. Let me make clear a couple of things. So one, and I've \\nsaid this already, so I apologize for repeating myself, but one, our target for CET1 is 13.1% , and so what you're \\ngoing to see over the course of the year is us managing down to that target? That's kind of one point.  \\nThe second point I want to be clear is that it's not the consent order. That's not something that that is \\nimpacting the capital actions and decisions that we take. We obviously forecast out the performance. As I've \\nsaid, Jane has said already, we see very strong continued earnings momentum , managing towards a  13.1% \\nCET1 ratio. And you'll see the buyback trajectory reflect getting down to that CET1.    \\nThe one thing I will mention, and you mentioned already is that we obviously have another CCAR process , \\nstress test that we will go through. And none of us can predict kind of what's on the other side of that from \\nan SCB point of view, but that will be an important factor as we get through the first half of the year and into \\nthe second half of the year in t erms of kind of the level of buybacks that we will be taking on a quarter -by-\\nquarter basis.  \\nSo I hope that helped. There are no artificial constraints, so to speak, that are in place.  This is us planning \\nand forecasting the performance of the franchise ensuring they can fuel high -returning growth opportunities \\nso that we're building a sustainable  franchise, looking at the capital requirements that we have and the \\nmanagement buffer that we put in place and therefore, taking that excess capacity and putting it towards \\nbuybacks, but with an eye towards the regulatory environment that we're in, and wh at I mean by that are the \\ncapital requirements that come out of the annual stress testing process that's run. So that's the basics of it \\nas we sit here today.   \\nERIKA NAJARIAN:  Got it. And just my second question, as we think about 2026. And again, I don't want to \\nput words in your mouth because clearly, it's very critical in terms of your targets and hitting them. So you \\ntargeted less than $53 billion. Is it fair to assume like  Jim was asking that $51 billion to $53 billion is not the \\ntarget, but it's less than $53 billion ? But to that end, I mean just taking a step back, I think, Jane, you said \\nsomething very important in that want to get to the returns in a sustainable way. And clearly, your \\nshareholders are sca rred by previous management when the returns went up to double digits and went back \\ntumbling down and wasn't sustainable. And should we just really think of this as, look, like it takes a while to \\nturn around a money center bank and 2026  may have been the target in 2022, but we're going to get there \\nin 202 7, 202 8 anyway, and just doing this in a sustainable way, and we're not robbing the bank of \\ninvestments.    \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Fourth  Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nJanuary  15, 202 5 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 5 Citigroup Inc.   12 \\n I guess I'm just trying to think about everybody is super focused on what you had said previously, now you \\nhave different targets, but is it just really like, look, it just takes longer , we'll get there, but just takes longer. \\nAnd maybe just an addendum to that, how should we expect Banamex to impact that 10% to 11% RoTCE  in \\nterms of the immediate impact after IPO and then after you deploy th at excess capital that you get back?   \\nJANE FRASER: Erika, we chose the words very carefully to say that 202 6 is a way point , it's not the \\ndestination. And w hen I'm looking at it, I'm looking out to 202 7, 202 8, what is the bank we want to be in \\nterms of our strategy, our performance, our culture, all those different dimensions. And we  just relentlessly \\nkeep going down that path, but we're going to take the right and responsible decisions as we go down it. So \\nour potential is for more than our medium -term target RoTCE , the potential of the bank and the journey that \\nwe're on is to improve our returns beyond there, for sure.    \\nAnd then you asked a question about Banamex. So, on that front, look, we had a singular focus on the \\nseparation of two banks , that was an enormous body of work because we had to put up Mexico's eighth  \\nlargest Bank de Novo in a very short period of time. It got done December 1 , that was over 100 regulatory \\napprovals to get that done. Now we have turned our full attention to the IPO. We're getting ready to be able \\nto IPO as soon we can. But given market conditions and given regulatory approvals, it's possible this could \\ngo into 202 6, but we're doing everything in our control to be ready as soon as possible. We are not the right \\nowner of the bank. We are committed to the simplification of Citi. We will follow a responsible process here.   \\nMARK MASON: And just in terms of the impact and the timing that Jane referenced, just keep in in mind that \\nthe financial impact of exiting Banamex comes two forms. One is the gain or loss on sale and two is the risk -\\nweighted asset release. The gain or loss on sale will run through the P&L at deconsolidation , so that's the \\npoint where we've gotten, or we've IPO -ed more than the 50%. And the ultimate benefit will be driven by the \\nRWA release when we fully divest our stake. And so hopefully, that helps, but it's not until we ’ve \\ndeconsolidated that we see that P&L impact and the CTA and other things like that kind of flow through the \\nP&L for Banamex.   \\nOPERATOR:  Our next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.  Your line is now \\nopen, please go ahead.   \\nGERARD CASSIDY: Jane, I'll pass on the  haggis, but I'll take you up on the whiskey.   \\nJANE FRASER: I didn't say I was buying just to be clear.   \\nGERARD CASSIDY:  Okay , I got it. Our expense report on this end. Anyway, just following up, Mark, on your \\ncomments about the IPO with Banamex. Can you guys remind us , or refresh our memories , on when the IPO \\nprocess starts, once it goes public, what percentage ownership do you guys expect to have? And second, \\nhave you given us any color on whether you expect to report a gain on this transaction or a loss as you just \\nreferenced, that will go through the P&L?   \\nMARK MASON: We haven't given any sense for the exact timing of that. As you know, this is a process. And \\nso Jane just spoke to the timing of that process, the first step, having been completed on December 1 with \\nthe separation , we are now obviously gearing up and readying ourselves for the IPO. There'll obviously be \\nimportant filings associated with that given our intent to dual list, there will be regulatory approvals that are \\nrequired kind of as we make headway with potential in vestors as part of the IPO process.    \\nAnd so there are a series of IPO steps that we will need to take over the course of the year in order to continue \\nto ready ourselves and there are things that we don't control. Like as Jane mentioned, the regulatory approval \\nprocess and timing for that as well as the market conditions. And so all of those factors are important. And \\nthen how the IPO occurs in terms of percentage that is taken on at that first tranche versus follow -on \\ntranches are important factors on when we get to deconsolidation. And so I haven't given you an exact timing \\non that but you can envision kind of 15% tranches that happen  over kind of a 12 -, 18 -month, 24 -month \\nperiod. And then obviously reaching a point of deconsolidation at which point that currency translation \\nadjustment starts to flow through the P&L. There's no material impact on capital, but it does flow through \\nthe P&L. And then ultimately, we exit 100% over the course of time.    \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Fourth  Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nJanuary  15, 202 5 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 5 Citigroup Inc.   13 \\n So I'm sorry, I'm not giving you precise dates and percentages. And part of that is because we are obviously \\non the front end of not only readying ourselves but considering alternative IPO structures and potential \\ninvestors/shareholders as part of that pro cess.   \\nGERARD CASSIDY:  Well, I appreciate the insights. And then as a follow -up question, and I really don't mean \\nthis as a ‘what have you done for me lately ?’ type of question because you guys have made so much progress \\nin what you're doing in your strategic changes here. But can you talk about the U.S. Personal Banking, many \\nof your questions today is about the RoTCE  consolidated and how you can improve that , and this business \\nhas a very low RoTCE  as you guys know, below your cost of capital. And structurally, when you look at it, if \\nyou look at the loans at the end of period  just over $220 billion , you r deposits  about $90 billion, which is \\nquite a bit different than your peers who have much higher ROEs. So how do you approach this business? \\nAnd again, I know you've been very busy divesting a lot of the businesses that are not important, but it seems \\nto me that this is a giant hurdle that you guys have to approach at some point in the near fut ure.   \\nJANE FRASER: Let me just chat a bit through this. So  what’s the path to the high er returns in U.S. Personal \\nBanking , it’s coming from top line revenue growth , improved expense base and also a lot more normalized \\ncredit environment , and that gets us to the mid - to high -teen returns in the medium term. I think we feel very \\nconfident and comfortable in that. You're seeing the proof points I talked about Banking , Wealth earlier, \\nwe’ve had another good quarter of revenue growth, had the ninth consecutive quarter of positive operating \\nleverage. So I think you should be getting some comfort around that.  \\nWhat's going to drive that growth? Co -brands , we just extended with American to be their sole issuer. It's \\ngoing to give exciting benefits to the American Airlines and the Citi cardholders. And it will be beneficial for \\nboth our growth and our returns.  In the proprietary front, we're investing. There's a lot of investment in \\ninnovation to drive growth. The refreshed Strata Premier Card , we've been enhancing the reward offerings  \\nand you're seeing us often now #1 in recognitions and awards around that area. Retail Services being \\nforensically focused on improving the partnership economics and driving top line growth. And then Retail \\nBanking , there  we're driving primary checking growth , we ’ve put  in simplified banking, so we get a much more \\nstreamlined customer proposition that's driving more of a relationship -based banking approach as opposed \\nto a transactional one.    \\nImportantly as well, the Retail Bank has been feeding our Wealth business. I think  you heard me earlier \\ntalking about that almost $3 trillion “off us” investment opportunity that we have from the retail banking \\ncustomer base. We transferred $17 billion of deposits from USPB to Wealth , so you've got to take  that , those \\ndynamics into account. So I hope you're taking from me, I feel confident in our ability to get to the medium -\\nterm targets we set for the business of mid - to high -teens. I feel comfortable about the growth trajectory \\nthat we've got based off the innovations we're putting through and the changes. And good expense discipline \\nand a better credit environment. So when you look at the mix of our business, I think you'll see us performing \\nnicely here.   \\nOPERATOR:  Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.  Your line is now \\nopen, please go ahead.   \\nMATT  O’CONNOR: Hi, I just want to follow up on Page 9 where you break out the technology and \\nTransformation  investment spend. And sorry if I missed this, but did you talk about the pace of those two  \\nlevels in your 202 5 and 202 6 expense guidance? I know directionally, you said it's going up. But did you give \\na magnitude ? \\nMARK MASON: I did not. Obviously, for both technology and Transformation  those are areas that we are \\ngoing to continue to invest in for all the reasons that we've mentioned. They obviously contribute to the \\nnumber in 202 5 being slightly down from the $53.8  billion , but they also represent, as I mentioned, what we \\nbelieve is required to kind of get the work done that we need to get done. And so those numbers will increase.  \\nThere are lots of puts and takes, as you know, through an annual expense forecast, right, including, as you \\nwould expect, we've got volume , we’ve got revenue growth here that's going to come with volume growth. \\nVolume, incentive comp, there's merit increases that go with that. And then we also have a series of \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Fourth  Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nJanuary  15, 202 5 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 5 Citigroup Inc.   14 \\n productivity actions that are playing through to offset those headwinds, whether it be the additional \\ncarryover from the org simplification and full year impact of that , or some of the Legacy /stranded coming \\ndown.  \\nAnd so there are puts and takes, but Transformation  and technology specifically, we are continuing to invest \\nin, in order to achieve what we need to get done here and also ensure the businesses have what they need to \\ndrive sustainable growth going forward.   \\nMATT  O’CONNOR:  And I guess, like how do you know that the recent increase that you're modeling internally \\nin these areas, how do you know you're spending enough and in the right way s to address your goals in the \\nTransformation  and also satisfy the regulatory requirements ? \\nJANE FRASER: Well, if I jump in, I feel very confident indeed that we know what we need to do. We know what \\nwe need to be spending on . Through the annual planning process that that concluded last month , it was \\nclear we did need to invest more. We increased the scope of some of the work on the data front. We brought \\nsome other work forward. We looked at what we needed to do on the technology front and some of the \\ncritical investments. So this is pretty fore nsic and when we're looking at Transformation , we're looking at \\ntechnology , we know what our target states need to be, and we know what we need to do to get there and \\nthe outcomes we need to be delivering.    \\nSo we've got our arms around this, and I think you're hearing that confidence from us around what we need \\nto do. We know the investments we need to make. You know what the outcomes and the benefits for \\nshareholders and the regulatory side need to be.   \\nOPERATOR:  Our next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with HSBC.  Your line is now open, \\nplease go ahead.   \\nSAUL MARTINEZ: Mark, the NII ex -Markets outlook, if I just take the fourth quarter and annualize that, I get \\nto something in the neighborhood of, I think, around  $47.4  billion , $47.5  billion  which is above the full year \\n202 4 level. I'm not sure exactly what “up modestly ” means , if that's 1%, 3%, 4% , but, and correct me if you \\nthink I’m wrong, but it seems like maybe there's a little bit of conservatism built in ? If you can just comment \\non how you think , and how we should think about the quarterly trajectory of NI ex -Markets ? Obviously, \\nthere's a day count issue in 1Q, but maybe how do you think through like , how we should expect that NII to \\nevolve over the course of the year ? \\nMARK MASON: I mean, why don't I just kind  of cut to the  chase on it a little bit, Saul, in the sense that , “up \\nmodestly ”, call it a couple of percentage points, 2 to 3 percentage points or so, right, in terms of how I think \\nabout it. And I think I've taken , I’ve gone through kind of the tailwinds and headwinds, so I won't kind of take \\nyou through that again. But I think the important takeaway should be that we're going to see continued \\nmomentum across the franchise driven by loan growth in the Branded Card side of the business and \\ncontinued deposit momentum, particularly operating deposits in S ervices. And we're going to do everything \\nthat we always do around the management of pricing, and we'll get a benefit from how we've been managing \\nour investment portfolio as those things mature. The combination of those efforts will offset , more than \\noffset  some of the headwinds that you'd expect in a declining rate environment , and modestly is, call it, 2% \\nto 3%.  \\nSAUL MARTINEZ:  Okay. Fair enough. And then on the expense outlook getting to below $53  billion  in 2026 , \\nI know that's consistent with what you've said in the past, does imply a pretty sharp reduction in 202 6, \\nespecially in light of continued revenue growth, it's pretty material operating leverage. Just I mean, how much \\nbenefit do you get from a more normalized severance ? In other words, how much are we thinking about \\nseverance coming down? What's sort of the impact or how to think about the Legacy , stranded costs coming \\ndown? Just maybe a little bit more meat on the bone in terms of how much these items will benefit 202 6 \\nversus 202 5? \\nMARK MASON:  Look, a couple of things. As I look at our severance costs, which, as I mentioned, has been \\nrunning high , it was $700  million , we're forecasting $600  million  in 2025. I think kind of normal through the \\ncycle is probably, call it, $300  million or so. And so that gives you some sense for that. I think the other thing \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Fourth  Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nJanuary  15, 202 5 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 5 Citigroup Inc.   15 \\n is, if you look at the other page, and again, there are a number of drivers or levers that we intend to pull to \\nbring that down. But in the All Other page where you look to the right, we show wind -downs and what's \\nremaining in terms of Legacy Franchise.  If you add those numbers together, $1.9 billion or so of expenses and \\nthink about a subset of that being stranded. And we're going to continue to focus on how do we bring down \\nstranded costs over the next couple of years.  \\nSo those are two important factors or contributors to the decline from the slightly lower than $53.8  billion  \\nto the $53  billion . There are additional productivity saves from prior investments that we've made. But those \\nare important factors. And then as we look at the Transformation  spend, that will continue to , or start to pay \\ndividends or help to bring down costs as well. So you've got really those four variables that contribute to us \\nbringing that number down. And as Jane has mentioned, we're going to even post 202 6, continue to bring , \\nor drive out more inefficiencies around the organization to fund require d investments for the business \\ngrowth and all with a continued focus on getting to less than 60% as we exit 2026, less than 60% operating \\nefficiency.  \\nOPERATOR:  Our final question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open, \\nplease go ahead.   \\nMIKE MAYO: Hi, this is your first full year of having the five line of business structure. So , Mark, do you still \\nhave the same line of business targets that you had last year? And Jane, with all the , it must have been a \\ndegree of hell to organize this way, get rid of your two intercompany holding companies, eliminate five layers \\nof management , expand  span of control and you guys went through a lot last year. And I'm just wondering, \\nis the worst over in terms of that kind of reorganization internally and the culture and the sentiment and how \\nyou see that continuing? But first, the concrete question abou t the targets, please.  \\nMARK MASON: So I guess I'll start first. So in terms of the targets, look, we set the targets across each of the \\nlines of business for the medium term. We've obviously brought down the 2026 to 10% to 11%. And so you'd \\nimagine there's some movement, at least for the 2026  in terms of those targets , Banking will likely be a little \\nbit lower than the mid -15%, if I think about 2026 as being that medium -term target date. But over time, I \\nexpect that the targets that I've set are the targets that we will achieve and even more because, as Jane \\nmentioned, 10 % to 11%, while that's our 2026 target , it is not our longer -term target as we think about RoTCE  \\nand the strength of these businesses in the aggregate franchise. So hopefully, that answers your question.   \\nJANE FRASER: And in terms of org simplification , culture, the best is still ahead , that is for sure. The org  went \\nthrough a lot. I'm really proud of how people responded. And I think we're really proud of how each of the \\nlines of business are driving the  business  performance forward. The bank is simpler. There is tremendous \\ntransparency for our investors as well as for me. There's much greater proximity to the businesses now. And \\nyou can see that the benefits that we're starting to realize from the strategy as we get closer and closer to the \\nRoTCE  targets and beyond for each of the businesses.  So I'm pleased to have 202 4 behind us. I'm proud of \\nwhat we achieved in 202 4. All the focus is on the future . Onwards.   \\nOPERATOR:  There are no further questions. I'll now turn the call over to Je nn Landis for closing remarks.   \\nJENNIFER LANDIS: Thank you, everyone. Please call us or e mail us if you have any follow -up questions. Have \\na great afternoon. Thank you.   \\nOPERATOR:  This concludes Citi's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Call.

Well, we certainly live in interesting \\ntimes.  And while I usually start our calls with our views on the global macro environment, we are particularly \\nproud of our progress this quarter, and so I shall start there. Indeed, in a pivotal year, this quarter c ontains \\nmultiple proof points that we are moving in the right direction and that our strategy is delivering concrete \\nresults.   \\nWe saw revenue growth and positive operating leverage for the firm and across all five businesses.  Our \\nbusinesses performed well as the rate cutting cycle began, with a double -digit increase in fee -based \\nrevenues, reflecting the growing diversity of our e arnings mix.  We continue to have share gains in Services \\nand Banking.  In Wealth, we saw a sizeable increase in client investments and flows.  We brought expenses \\ndown whilst continuing to invest in our transformation.  And we continued to attract top lea ders in the \\nindustry and successfully combine them with our own teams in Banking and Wealth. So, while we are not yet \\nwhere we want to be, the impact of the changes we are making is clearly evident in our momentum and \\nimproving performance.  \\nTurning to the macro, now while growth is a notch slower than last year, global economic performance \\ncontinues to be surprisingly resilient.  Whatever you want to call the US landing, the sentiment around it is \\nmore optimistic, supported by the recent posi tive payrolls report.  And we see a healthy yet more discerning \\nUS consumer, and a US corporate sector on its front foot.  Manufacturing weakness is restraining a modest \\nrebound in Europe which continues to struggle with more structural challenges around its competitiveness, \\nas highlighted by Draghi’s report. In China, consumer sentiment and the property market remain a concer n \\nas markets await details on the expected fiscal stimulus.  India, Asean, Japan, the Middle East, Mexico and \\nBrazil are all notable global bright spots.  \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Third Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nOctober  15, 202 4 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   2 \\n Today we reported net income of $3.2 billion and earnings per share of $1.51 with an ROTCE of 7%.  Overall \\nrevenues grew by 3% ex -divestitures, with each of our core businesses delivering growth and positive \\noperating leverage.  While we continue to make substantial investments in our transformation, the \\nefficiencies gained from our simplification and other efforts drove a 2% reduction in overall expenses.  \\nTurning to the five businesses, Services delivered a record quarter with revenues up by 8%. Fee growth, the \\nbest indicator of underlying momentum, was significant. And this, combined with loan and deposit volume \\ngrowth, drove this quarter’s excellent perfo rmance.  Treasury and Trade Solutions was up 4% year over year \\nreflecting good underlying momentum in the core drivers.  And Securities Services was up 24%, reflecting the \\nbenefit of new mandates and an increase in assets under custody.  Both TTS and Securi ties Services \\nachieved over 10% wallet share in our target markets through the first half of the year.      \\nLast week we announced that we are the first global bank to complete the integration of our cross -border \\nservices with Mastercard Move. Now, this will ultimately enable near -instant, secure payments to the vast \\nMastercard debit network, starting with 14 ma rkets with more to come early next year.  And this is another \\ngreat example of our continued investment in market -leading product innovations.  \\nIn Markets, revenues were up slightly on the back of a better -than - expected September.  Equities was up \\n32% with robust performance across all products. Our continued strong performance in Equities validates \\nboth our strategy and execution to grow Prime a nd Cash. Fixed Income however was down 6% — our Rates \\nand Currencies business didn’t match last year’s standout performance.  \\nIt was a particularly pleasing quarter in Banking.  Despite the muted IPO market, Investment Banking fees \\nare up 44% driven by investment grade debt issuance as our clients pulled forward activity ahead of the U.S. \\nelection.  Corporate sentiment remains po sitive as boards pursue strategic transactions, such as the $36 \\nbillion Mars acquisition of Kellanova, where we are the sole advisor and lead financier.  Our strategy in \\nBanking continues to gain momentum, and we are steadily growing our share in key targe t sectors such as \\nhealthcare and tech, with a healthy pipeline ahead.  And the significant upside of our franchise continues to \\nattract the top talent to Citi.  \\nDuring the quarter, we announced an innovative $25 billion private credit partnership with our longtime \\nclient Apollo, giving us the ability to source new transactions without using our balance sheet.  This \\npartnership positions us with another solution fo r debt financing for our clients, and it allow us to engage in \\nprivate credit with the same depth and expertise as we currently do with syndicated debt markets.  \\nWe are also starting to see the positive impact of the significant changes we’ve implemented in our Wealth \\nfranchise, with revenues up 9%.  It’s a notable example of the traction I referenced earlier. As Andy and the \\nteam intensify the focus on our investments busines s, we grew client investment assets by 24%.  And we \\nwere particularly pleased with the performance in Asia and in Citigold.  I continue to be excited by the \\nopportunities and the sheer potential of our franchise.  \\nDuring the quarter, we signed an agreement to exit trust administration and fiduciary services as we continue \\nto sharpen the focus of our Wealth business.  We have more to do to reach our medium -term margin and \\nreturns targets, but this quarter is a good i ndicator that we are on the way there.  \\nU.S. Personal Banking revenues were up 3%.  We grew Branded Cards revenues by 8% with account \\nacquisitions, spend and payment rates all driving higher interest -earning balances.  Lower discretionary \\nspending is impacting our Retail Services portfolio; howe ver, we continue to see lower payment rates \\ncontributing to interest earning balances.  In Retail Banking, we are growing our mortgage portfolio as the \\nrate environment shifts, as well as growing overall loans.  \\nThe U.S. consumer dynamics remain remarkably consistent with prior quarters.  Our customers are healthy \\nbut more discerning in their spend, with signs of stress isolated to the lower FICOs.  We have maintained \\nstrong credit discipline, and our card portfol ios continue to perform very much in line with our expectations.   \\nIn terms of capital, while uncertainty about the Basel 3 endgame prevails, our capital position remains very \\nrobust, and we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.7%.  During the quarter, we returned $2.1 billion in \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Third Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nOctober  15, 202 4 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   3 \\n capital, including the repurchase of $1 billion of common shares.  We will continue to repurchase stock as we \\nevaluate the right level on a quarterly basis.  \\nAs you know, our Transformation is our number one priority.  This quarter we closed another long -standing \\nconsent order which related to the effectiveness of our anti -money laundering systems.  We have increased \\nour investments in areas where we have not m ade sufficient progress, such as data quality management. I \\nand the management team remain steadfast and determined to get this Transformation right and to get this \\ndone.  \\nWe will close out this pivotal year with momentum and with determination to continue to improve \\nperformance in each business and the firm overall.  We are committed to meeting our revenue and expense \\ntargets for the year as well as our return target for th e medium -term.  I am very proud of our senior leadership \\nand the entire organization as we demonstrate the potential of our unique global franchise. It is a privilege to \\nlead this firm.  \\nWith that, I would like to turn it over to Mark and then we would be delighted, as always, to take your \\nquestions.  \\nMARK MASON : Thanks, Jane and good morning, everyone.  I am going to start with the firmwide financial \\nresults, focusing on year -over -year comparisons for the third quarter unless I indicate otherwise, and then \\nspend a little more time on the businesses.  \\nOn slide 5, we show financial results for the full firm . For the quarter, we reported net income of \\napproximately $3.2 billion, EPS of $1.51 and an RoTCE of 7.0% on $20.3 billion of revenues.  Total revenues \\nwere up 1% on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture -related impacts, revenues were up 3%, driven by \\ngrowth across each of our businesses.  As you can see on the bottom left side of the page, net interest income \\nexcluding Markets was down 1% YoY, largely due to lower interest rates in Argentina.  And non -interest \\nrevenue excluding Markets was up 9% as we continued to see strong fee momentum across Services, \\nBanking and Wealth.  Year -to-date, revenues are up 1% on a reported basis, and are up 3% excluding \\ndivestiture -related impacts.  Expenses were $13.3 billion, down 2%, largely driven by savings associated with \\nour organizational simplification and stranded cost reductions, partially offset by volume related expenses \\nand continued investments in the Transformation and other risk and c ontrol initiatives.  Year -to-date, \\nexpenses are up 1%, primarily driven by the FDIC special assessment and civil money penalties.  Cost of credit \\nwas $2.7 billion, largely driven by net credit losses in Cards as well as ACL builds across the businesses, \\nprimarily for portfolio growth and mix.  At the end of the quarter, we had over $22 billion in total reserves with \\na reserve -to-funded loans ratio of approximately 2.7%.  And year -to-date, excluding the divesture related \\nimpacts, we generated positive operating leverage for the firm, a nd reported an RoTCE of 7.2%.  \\nOn slide 6, we show the expense trend over the past five quarters. This quarter we reported expenses of $13.3 \\nbillion, down 2%, and 1% sequentially.  As we’ve said before, we will continue to increase our investments to \\naddress data governance and data quality related to regulatory reporting and are committed to spending \\nwhatever is necessary to address these areas and the Transformation more broadly.  Although a lot more \\nwork remains, we have started to see benefits from our prior investments play through.  We’ve continued to \\nsimplify our technology infrastructure, retiring over 450 applications year -to-date and now over 1,250 since \\nour 2022 Investor Day.  We’ve upgraded 100% of our over 2,300 ATMs in North America and Asia Pacific to \\nnext -gen software for better customer security and monitoring.  And we have streamlined our cloud \\nonboarding process, reducing time to onboard applications to the public cloud from over 7 weeks to 2 weeks.  \\nEach of these initiatives will result in both improvement of our operating ef ficiency and our safety and \\nsoundness.  And in terms of our full year expenses, we continue to expect that we will be at the higher end of \\nthe guidance range of $53.5 to 53.8 billion, excluding the FDIC special assessment and civil money penalties. \\nAnd as we’ve said before, we, of course, will c ontinue to look for opportunities to absorb the civil money \\npenalties.  \\nOn slide 7, we show net interest income, loans and deposits where I’ll speak to sequential variances.  In the \\nthird quarter, net interest income declined 1%.  Excluding Markets, net interest income was up 4%, largely \\ndriven by volume growth in USPB as well as higher deposit spreads in Services and Wealth.  NIM declined by \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Third Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nOctober  15, 202 4 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   4 \\n 8 basis points, driven by a decline in Markets due to seasonally higher dividends in the second quarter.  \\nAverage loans were up 1%, driven by growth in Services and USPB, partially offset by modest declines in \\nBanking and Legacy Franchises.  Average deposits were roughly flat, as growth in Services was largely offset \\nby a decline in Legacy Franchises.  And as you think about guidance for NII ex -Markets in the fourth quarter:  \\nAs short -end rates continue to come down, we expect a headwind on floating -rate assets  which will be \\nsomewhat offset by disciplined deposit pricing.  Further offsetting that will be a continued benefit from \\nsecurities being reinvested at higher yields.  And as a reminder, we expect an ongoing NII headwind as Legacy \\nFranchises’ loans and deposits continue to come down.  So, taking all of this into account, we expect NII ex -\\nMarkets to be roughly flat sequentially in the fourth quarter, and for the full year to be slightly down, better \\nthan we had previously guided.  \\nOn slide 8, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics, which reflect our disciplined risk appetite \\nframework.  Across our Cards portfolio, approximately 85% of our loans are to consumers with FICO scores \\nof 660 or higher.  Based on what we see, the US consumer continues to remain healthy and resilient.  Spend \\nand payment rates continue to normalize, and underlying credit performance remains broadly in line with \\nour expectations.  NCLs increased year -over -year as card loan vintages that were originated over the last few \\nyears continue to mature at the same time.  Sequentially, NCLs declined while delinquencies increased, both \\nin-line with historical third quarter seasonality. Absent this seasonality, we continue to see stabilization in \\nearly -stage delinquencies.  We remain well reserved with a reserve -to-funded loan ratio of approximately \\n8.2% for our U.S. Cards portfolio.  Our Corporate portfolio is largely investment grade and corporate non -\\naccrual loans remained low, at 31 basis points. As such, we feel v ery comfortable with the over $22 billion of \\ntotal reserves that we have in the current environment.  \\nTurning to slide 9, we provide details on our balance sheet, capital and liquidity, which are a reflection of our \\nrisk appetite, strategy and business model.  Our $1.3 trillion deposit base is well -diversified across regions, \\nindustries, customers and account types.  $840 billion are corporate, spanning 90 countries, and are crucial \\nto how our clients fund their daily operations around the world.  The majority of our remaining deposits, \\nabout $400 billion, are well -diversified across the Private Bank, Citigold , Retail and Wealth at Work \\nofferings.  And of our total deposits, roughly 70% are US dollar denominated with the remainder spanning \\nover 60 currencies.  Our asset mix also reflects our strong risk appetite framework.  Our $689 billion loan \\nportfolio is well -diversified across consumer and corporate loans.  In the quarter, deposit growth outpaced \\nloan growth resulting in higher cash balances which contributed to available liquidity resources of \\napproximately $960 billion.  We continue to feel very good about the  strength of our balance sheet and the \\nquality of our assets and liabilities, which position us well to serve our clients and execute on our growth \\nstrategy.  \\nOn slide 10, we show the sequential CET1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter. First, we \\ngenerated $3.0 billion of net income to common shareholders, which added 27 basis points. Second, we \\nreturned $2.1 billion in the form of common div idends and share repurchases, which drove a reduction of 18 \\nbasis points. Third, we generated 12 basis points from unrealized AFS gains.  And finally, the remaining 9 \\nbasis point reduction was driven by an increase in RWA as we continue to invest in accreti ve growth \\nopportunities.  We ended the third quarter with a preliminary CET1 capital ratio of 13.7% relative to our target \\nof 13.3%.  As a reminder, effective October 1st, our new CET1 capital ratio requirement is 12.1%, and we still \\nplan on holding a 100 basis point management buffer on top of that for now.  As we think about the coming \\nquarters, there are a few things that we will continue to consider as we manage our capital levels, including \\nclient demand as well as how the macro and Basel 3 Endgame evolve s. We will take all of this into account \\nas it relates to capital levels and the level of share repurchases on a quarter -by-quarter basis.  \\nTurning to the businesses on slide 11.  In Services, revenues were up 8%, reflecting continued momentum \\nacross Securities Services and TTS, both of which continue to gain share through the first half of this year.  \\nNet interest income was roughly flat, as the benefit of higher deposit volumes was largely offset by a decline \\nin interest rates in Argentina.  On a sequential basis, net interest income was up 7%, driven by volume growth \\nas we continue to onboard high -quality operating deposits and the benefit from  higher deposit spreads.  \\nNon -interest revenue increased 33%, driven by a smaller impact from currency devaluation in Argentina as \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Third Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nOctober  15, 202 4 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   5 \\n well as continued strength in underlying fee drivers in TTS and Securities Services. Excluding the impact of \\nthe Argentine Peso devaluation, NIR increased 11%, driven by growth in cross border transactions, US Dollar \\nClearing volumes and Commercial Card vo lumes.  Expenses increased 3%, primarily driven by investments in \\ntechnology, other risk and controls and product innovation, including the expansion of the CitiDirect \\nCommercial Banking platform into additional markets.  Cost of credit was $127 million, pri marily driven by a \\nbuild related to unremittable corporate dividends being held on behalf of clients.  Average loans increased \\n5% primarily driven by continued demand for export and agency finance as well as working capital loans.  \\nAverage deposits increased 4% as we continue to see growth in operating deposits.  Services generated \\npositive operating leverage and delivered net income of approximately $1.7 billion.  And continues to deliver \\na high RoTCE, coming in at 26.4% for the quarter and 24.7% year -to-date.  \\nOn slide 12, we show the results for Markets for the third quarter. Markets revenues were up 1%, driven by \\ngrowth in Equities, partially offset by a decline in Fixed Income.  Equities revenues increased 32%, driven by \\nmomentum in Prime with balances up approximately 22%, growth in Derivatives and higher Cash volumes.  \\nFixed Income revenues decreased 6%, driven by Rates and Currencies, which was down 10%, partially offset \\nby Spread Products and Other Fixed Income, which was up 5%.  While Rates and Currencies declined from \\nlast year, which was the strongest third quarter in the previous 10 years, we did see good momentum in FX \\nfrom increased corporate client activity.  Spread Products and Other Fixed Income was higher driven by \\nFinancing and Securitization volumes and underwriting fees, partially offset by lower Commodities on lower \\ngas volatility.  Expenses increased 1% primarily due to higher volume related expenses.  Cost of credit was \\n$141 million, driven by a n ACL build primarily related to portfolio mix in Spread Products.  Average loans \\nincreased 10%, largely driven by asset -backed lending in Spread Products as well as margin loans in Equities.  \\nAverage trading account assets increased 18%, largely driven by client demand for US Treasuries, foreign \\ngovernment securities and mortgage -backed securities.  Markets generated another quarter of positive \\noperating leverage and delivered net income of approximately $1.1 billion with an RoTCE of 7.9% for the \\nquarter and 9.7% year -to-date.  \\nOn slide 13, we show the results for Banking for the third quarter. Banking revenues were up 16%, largely \\ndriven by growth in Investment Banking.  Investment Banking revenues were up 31% and fees were up 44%, \\nwith increases across Debt Capital Markets, Advisory and Equity Capital Markets.  DCM benefited from \\ncontinued strong Investment Grade issuance.  Advisory benefited from strong announced deal volume earlier \\nthis year.  And in ECM we saw stronger follow -on activity, which was offset by fewer IPOs amid marke t \\nvolatility in August.  Both year -to-date and in the quarter, we’ve driven wallet share gains, including in the \\nHealthcare and Technology sectors where we’ve been investing.  Corporate Lending revenues, excluding \\nmark -to-market on loan hedges, increased 5%, primarily driven by a smaller impact from currency \\ndevaluation in Argentina.  Expenses decreased 9%, primarily driven by benefits of headcount reductions as \\nwe continued to right size the workforce and expense base.  Cost of credit was $177 million, driven by an ACL \\nbuild primarily for portfolio mix changes.  Average loans decreased 1% as we maintained strict discipline \\naround returns.  Banking generated positive operating leverage for the third quarter in a row and delivered \\nnet income of $238 million with an RoTCE of 4.3% for the quarter and 7.2% year -to-date.  \\nOn slide 14, we show the results for Wealth for the third quarter. As you can see from our performance this \\nquarter, we are making good progress against our strategy and expect that momentum to continue.  Revenue \\nwas up 9%, driven by a 15% increase in NIR as we grew investment fee revenues on momentum in client \\ninvestment assets, which grew 24%. NII increased 6% driven by higher deposit volumes and spreads.  \\nExpenses decreased 4%, driven by the continued benefits of headcount reductions as we right size the \\nworkforce and expense base.  Cost of credit was $33 million, largely driven by net credit losses of $27 million.  \\nEnd -of-period client balances increased 14%, driven by higher client investment assets and deposits, both \\nin North America and internationally.  Average deposits increased 4%, reflecting the transfer of relationships \\nand the associated deposits from USPB, partially offset by a shift in deposits to higher -yielding investments \\non Citi’s platform.  Average loans decreased 1%, as we continued to optimize  capital usage.  Wealth generated \\nanother quarter of positive operating leverage and delivered net income of $283 million with an RoTCE of \\n8.5% for the quarter and 6.8% year -to-date.  \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Third Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nOctober  15, 202 4 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   6 \\n On slide 15, we show the results for US Personal Banking for the third quarter.  US Personal Banking revenues \\nwere up 3%, driven by NII growth of 2% and lower partner payments.  Branded Cards revenues increased 8%, \\nwith interest -earning balance growth of 8% as payment rates continue to normalize and we continue to see \\ngrowth in spend volumes, which were up 3%.  Retail Services revenues were down 1%, due to a slowing \\ngrowth rate in interest earning balances.  Retail Banking revenues decreased 8%, driven by the t ransfer of \\nrelationships and the associated deposits to our Wealth business.  Expenses decreased 1%, driven by \\ncontinuous productivity focus, partially offset by higher volume -related expenses. Cost of credit was $1.9 \\nbillion, largely driven by net credit losses and a modest build for volume growth.  We continue to expect \\nBranded Cards to be in the 3.5% to 4.0% NCL range for the full year.  In Retail Services, we continue to expect \\nto be around the high end of the 5.75% to 6.25% range for the full year, driven  by both the impact of \\npersistent inflation and high interest rates as well as lower sales activity at our partners.  Average deposits \\ndecreased 23%, largely driven by the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our Wealth \\nbusiness. USPB generated another quarter of positive operating leverage and delivered net income of $522 \\nmillion with an RoTCE of 8.2%  for the quarter and 5.2% year -to-date.  As we’ve said before, the USPB \\nsegment creates a lot of value for the firm. We knew 2024 would be a  tough year, as we lap the credit costs, \\nbut we have a path to higher returns. We will continue to drive revenue growth through product innovations \\nwhile improving the operating efficiency of the business. And at the same time, we expect the credit \\nenviron ment to normalize.  All of which will ultimately drive USPB to a high -teens return over the medium \\nterm.  \\nSlide 17 shows our full year 2024 outlook and medium -term guidance.  We’ve generated $61.6 billion of \\nrevenue year -to-date, driven by NIR ex -Markets growth of 12%, and are on track to meet our $80 to 81 billion \\nfull year guidance.  As I mentioned, we now expect NII ex -Markets to be slightly down for the full year. And \\nwith year -to-date expenses of $40.4 billion excluding the FDIC special assessment and civil money \\npenalties, we continue to expect to be on the higher -end of our full y ear guidance range.  As we take a step \\nback, the third quarter represents another quarter of solid progress and a set of proof points towards \\nimproving firmwide and business performance.  We remain focused on continuing to improve our \\nperformance and executing on our Transformation.  These priorities remain critical to strengthening our \\noperations and becoming a more efficient, agile and client -centric company as we continue to make \\nprogress on achieving our medium -term targets.  With that, Jane and I will be happy to take your questions.  \\nOPERATOR:  At this time, we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] . Our first question will \\ncome from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.  \\nGLENN SCHORR:  Hi. Thanks very much. Good guidance. I appreciate it. I\\'m curious on the card losses in \\nRetail financial services, if you could talk to like, the 2024 exit rate seems like it will be higher than the full \\nyear guide at 6.25%. Maybe you could talk to the trajectory there and then the huge reserves that you have \\nbuilt in there and anything you can tell us about the portfolios so we can keep expectations in the right spot. \\nThanks.  \\nMARK MASON : Yeah, sure. Why don\\'t I take that. Good morning, Glenn. So a couple things. So, one, I think \\nthat on Retail Services you\\'re seeing a couple of things kind of play out. So, one, you\\'re seeing kind of spend \\nvolumes trend down a bit. You are seeing payment ra tes come down as well. That obviously is fueling the \\naverage interest earning balance growth that we\\'re seeing. And then you are also seeing with the spend \\nvolume come down , there\\'s a denominator effect that plays through which pushes up obviou sly the loss \\nrates that we\\'re seeing. That still in the quarter is in line with our guidance but in light of what we saw earlier \\nin the year and normal seasonality, we would expect that number to be on the higher end of that range and \\nlikely higher in the fourth quarter, but the higher in the fourth quarter again depends on what traffic is like \\nand what the holiday spending season looks like through the end of the year.  \\nI would say the reserve levels we have are very healthy as it relates to this portfolio. I think in the back of the \\ndeck we show kind of the reserve to loan ratio at about 11.7% or so. So well -reserved for the Retail Services \\nportfolio in light of the envi ronment that we\\'re in.  \\nSimilarly, we are seeing the stabilization from a delinquency point of view across both portfolios kind of play \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Third Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nOctober  15, 202 4 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   7 \\n through and so net -net, we are obviously actively managing this. The retail partner activity is a critical \\ncomponent of it and that will drive fourth quarter activity or levels, but we do feel as if we\\'ll end up on the \\nhigher end of the range here.  \\nGLENN SCHORR:  Okay. Thanks for all that, Mark. Just one quickie  On your partnership with Apollo, very \\ninteresting and in line with a lot of other things we\\'ve seen. Curious on how you thought about going with \\none specific partner versus a group and then more importantly, are there other parts of the franchise that \\ncould benefit with stronger ties to private markets, I\\'m thinking specifically in the asset -backed world. \\nAppreciate it. Thank you.  \\nJANE FRASER : So we\\'re delighted to partner with Apollo because what this does is it\\'s uniting our \\ncomprehensive banking reach and expertise together and it\\'s enabling us to offer our clients more innovative \\nand tailored financing solutions. There will be some other par tners involved in this as well. Mubadala is \\nanother participant in this.  \\nAnd when we look at this, it\\'s very, very beneficial for our clients. We\\'re always looking at how we can best \\nserve our clients, give them the most options and this platform enhances corporate and sponsor clients \\naccess to the private lending capital pool at real scale in $25 billion is a very sizable partnership here and it \\nprovides funding certainty and strategic transactions.  \\nIt\\'s exclusive for LBOs, non -investment grade in the US. The US is obviously the bulk of the private credit \\nmarket, it’s the behemoth globally. It would be great to see that market developing in Europe and it wouldn\\'t \\nsurprise me to see us doing more partnerships and other pieces going forward.  \\nOPERATOR:  Our next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Your line is now \\nopen. Please go ahead.  \\nEBRAHIM POONAWALA:  Good morning. I guess maybe, Mark, for you, like looking at slide 7 on NII, and \\nmaybe we can break it down into Markets and ex -Markets. In the ex -Markets NII, $11.96 billion this quarter, \\nbased on what you\\'ve said, the back book repricing, deposit flex, is  it safe to conclude that the ex -Markets \\nNII bottomed in 2Q 2024? And I noticed the securities yield actually went lower, 7 bps quarter -over -quarter. \\nSo was there something one -off that impacted the yield this quarter relative to the exp ectations you outlined \\nearlier?  \\nMARK MASON : So when you look at slide 7, you got a couple of things playing through. So your point around \\nthe low number, the low print, $11.46 billion in the second quarter, that really is a combination relative to first \\nquarter of FX translation, some seasonally low er card balances, and lower interest payments in Argentina \\nplaying through that sequential 1Q to 2Q.  \\nThe third quarter, as I mentioned earlier, is really a by -product of volumes on the lending side and spreads, \\ndeposit spreads in Services and Wealth and I think that I\\'ve already given kind of the guide for the fourth \\nquarter where that is likely to be fla t. But I think it\\'s important to just remind everyone of the headwinds and \\ntailwinds that play through this NII line. And from a tailwind point of view, I would expect to see continued \\nvolume from loans, USPB in particular but also Services and we\\'re talki ng ex -Markets, so Services. I\\'d also \\nexpect to see continued benefit from the reinvestment of securities at higher yields and then we\\'re actively \\nmanaging beta as it relates to with our clients and if you think about kind of what we saw in the uptick of \\nrates, we\\'re actively managing that on the down tick as it relates to our institutional clients.  \\nI think the other point here is let\\'s not forget that our interest rate sensitivity skews more towards non -US \\nand so a lot of what we think about and talk about tends to be how US rates move and the betas around that. \\nWe\\'re still going to have a bit of bet a catch -up outside of the US and so that\\'s one of the headwinds there as \\nwell as the Legacy Franchise exits.  \\nSo you\\'ve got this long -winded way of saying, I do expect flat into the fourth quarter. I\\'m not going to give \\nguidance for 2025. But what I will say is to keep the growth momentum to get to our medium -term targets, \\nthat\\'s 4% to 5% of a CAGR and that\\'s goin g to be a combination of NII and NIR but skewing NIR. And I want \\nto point that out because the third quarter and the year -to-date numbers that you see in our performance \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Third Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nOctober  15, 202 4 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   8 \\n shows very strong fee NIR growth across each of these five businesses and I don\\'t want to lose sight of that \\nas you all really  try to get a handle on how we get to that medium term. We\\'re evidencing that shift towards \\nmore fee revenue as we speak. So I\\'ll stop there, but I think that\\'s important and hopefully I\\'ve answered your \\nquestion around the NII forecast here.  \\nEBRAHIM POONAWALA:  That\\'s helpful. And agreed on the fee momentum. Just one quick on the Wealth \\nsegment. We\\'ve seen a considerable progress year -to-date in terms of going from zero ROE to about 8.5% \\nRoTCE, significant operating leverage. I think I heard Jane say that momentu m should continue. Is it fair to \\nassume that RoTCE remains , like Wealth remains a positive story as we think about how Citi\\'s ROE continues \\nto improve from here as we get towards the target? Any color on the Wealth side would be helpful.  Thank \\nyou.  \\nJANE FRASER : Yes, I agree with you. I think we\\'re all very pleased to see the progress on the strategy we laid \\nout at Investor Day. The Wealth target we have in the medium term is 15% to 20% and with that a 25% to \\n30% operating margin and we\\'re making steady progress there. I think the first piece was putting the pieces \\nof the global wealth organization together and now we\\'re focused o n positioning for growth and reshaping \\nthe business to deliver the returns that we all expect.  \\nA very important part of that is shifting our mix by growing investments. We had 24% growth in client \\ninvestment assets this quarter. I would call that a good start to realizing the potential that we have here. And \\nat the same time, Andy continues to right -size our expense base and drive productivity. Our advisor \\nproductivity increased over 50% in Citigold North America. So a number of different areas that he\\'s focused \\non so that we can continue to grow the investment space including some important new tale nt that we\\'ve \\nbeen bringing in that I\\'m sure you\\'ve noticed.  \\nOPERATOR:  Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go \\nahead.  \\nMIKE MAYO:  Hi. What assurance can you give that Citi can both meet its 2026 expense guide, the $51 billion \\nto $53 billion and I note the year -to-date run rate implies $54 billion. So getting from that $54 billion run \\nrate down to the $51 billion to $53 billion by 202 6 and meet its regulatory targets. In other words, assurance \\nthat Citi can both walk and chew gum at the same time. And I guess I\\'d highlight as you know, on October 2 \\nSenator Warren asked the OCC to impose growth restrictions because Citi is \"t oo big to manage.\" I would \\nassume you don\\'t agree with that, but still the question that a lot of people have is what assurances can you \\ngive that an asset cap won\\'t happen at Citigroup? Thanks.  \\nMARK MASON : Thanks, Mike. So why don\\'t I start with your expense question and I\\'m sure Jane will chime \\nin on some of the other parts of your question. So, look, we put out medium term targets of $51 billion to $53 \\nbillion in 2026 , revenue dependent, of course, and that\\'s consistent with the target we gave of less than 60% \\nefficiency ratio. And we\\'ve got a target t his year as you know on the high end of $53.8 billion  [ex-FDIC special \\nassessment and Civil Money Penalties ]. And so we\\'ve got to get from $53.8  billion down to $51 billion to $53 \\nbillion by 2026. I\\'m not giving guidance for 2025 but you can expect that that will likely glide down to that \\nnumber.  \\nWhat\\'s driving the reduction? So we\\'ve talked before about $1.5 billion in savings largely related to the \\nrestructuring and driving down headcount reduction associated with that. We talked about another $500 \\nmillion to  $1 billion related to expense reductions from eliminating stranded cost as we continue to exit. \\nWe\\'re out of nine of these consumer countries already. And we talk about starting to see efficiencies and \\nbenefits from the investments and the transformation a nd technology towards the end of 2026 . And those \\nare the three drivers that are important for us to continue to realize between now and 2026.  \\nWill there be headwinds? Yes. There will be, the transformation is a multiyear process. We\\'re also investing \\nin risk controls and regulatory spend to support improving our operations. Of course, there will be headwinds \\nbut there will also be things that we  shift away from. There will be tailwinds associated with it. Jane \\nmentioned some of the productivity efforts that both Andy as well as Vis are pushing on. You look across \\nthese businesses and you see positive operating leverage across the board. So that m eans that Andy Morton \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Third Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nOctober  15, 202 4 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   9 \\n as well as Gonzalo are too looking at their cost structures, at expenses that they can take out or productivity \\nthat they might improve. And so there will be additional costs that we have to incur. We incurred additional \\ncosts this year. But there will als o be additional productivity savings that we continue to tease out to ensure \\nthat we get to these targets.  \\nJANE FRASER : And, Mike, let me pick up on part of the second part of the question in terms of the progress \\non the transformation. As you know, and as Mark\\'s talked to you about, the transformation reverses historic \\nunderinvestment in Citi\\'s infrastructure. It enhances our risk and control environment. And it\\'s a strategic \\noverhaul as we\\'ve talked about that goes well beyond the consent order to simplify and to strengthen Citi to \\nthe benefit of all of the stakeholders we have.  \\nWe are already a very different Citi today. We\\'ve made enormous change over the past three years, \\ndramatically simpler business model, significant org change so we align our structure to that model. We now \\nhave a flatter organization with greater accountab ility and as Mark talked about through the investments in \\nour transformation, we\\'re focused on simplifying our operation al model, modernizing our infrastructure risk \\nand controls and all of that reduces risk as we go.  \\nWe\\'re well on the way in executing the transformation plans. We\\'ve made meaningful progress as was \\nacknowledged publicly by one of our regulators and it\\'s a wide range book of work. We\\'ve made significant \\nstrides in areas such as risk management, complianc e and accountability and that\\'s well beyond the big \\nbodies of work about consolidating our platforms. So we had 1,250 retired since 2022 as Mark mentioned.  \\nOther areas of progress, enhance our stress testing capabilities, they\\'re faster, more frequent, more precise \\nassessment s. We put in place new target operating models for wholesale credit risk, enterprise risk, price risk \\nfirm wide. A huge body of work reducing risk and high risk processes such as payments and Markets through \\nsystemic preventative controls. We\\'ve been implem enting the  XiNG  platform , this is the strategic cloud \\nsolution for market risk analytics. Values trades on demand and at scale. And we\\'ve embedded risk and \\ncontrols into our performance management framework and tied that to compensation for the full firm. So \\nthese are just giving  you a flavor of these big body of work that we are executing and getting  done . \\nI was very pleased that we closed the FRB, AML/BSA consent order particularly given heightened risk and \\nscrutiny in this area. That is the third consent order we\\'ve closed since 2021 and we\\'ve been very transparent. \\nWhere there are areas in which our execu tion is delayed against our original timelines as is the case with our \\ndata work. We take a step back, determine what we need to change in those areas and get back on track and \\nmake relevant tech and people investments. So I feel very confident about the s trategy we\\'ve laid out for the \\nfirm, the deliberate path we\\'re on, the huge progress we\\'ve already made, and that we will continue making \\nwith determination and with clarity going forward.  \\nMIKE MAYO:  So, just one follow -up. When , and you do have the amended consent order that\\'s not new \\nanymore , but is this a problem with your dealing with clients or is this an issue with giving the regulators the \\ninformation that they need? And just again, you don\\'t , just to confirm, you don\\'t have an asset cap now, is it \\nfair to assume that you don\\'t expect an asset cap any time soon or could you have an asset cap and we don\\'t \\neven know about that? Thanks.  \\nJANE FRASER : We don\\'t have any problems dealing with our clients, quite the opposite. We\\'re a source of \\nstrength for our clients in terms of the provision of their payments businesses, their trading businesses, the ir \\nconsumer credit businesses, all across the board. So I would say quite the opposite. We are a source of \\ntremendous strength for them and you see that in the results of this quarter which were very pleasing across \\nthe board in every single one of our busin esses.  \\nWe are working closely with our regulators. We incorporate their feedback as well as our own lessons learned. \\nIf we fall behind in an element of the consent orders but do understand the breadth of the consent order \\nwork as I laid out and the meaningful pro gress we\\'re making across multiple areas, and when we fall behind \\nin an area we increase the investments needed and look at any lessons learned in the approach and address \\nit. So I feel very comfortable.  \\nMARK MASON : So again, we don\\'t have – we\\'re not talking about issues as it relates to client information, \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Third Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nOctober  15, 202 4 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   10 \\n client data, client reporting. We\\'re not talking about information as it relates to financials. We\\'re talking \\nabout regulatory reporting, all right. And regulatory reporting as I\\'ve mentioned in prior calls, we\\'re a global \\nfirm. We\\'ve got over 11,000 regul atory reports and we\\'re talking about ensuring that the data that we capture \\nat trade entry is the data that\\'s required to ultimately show up on these various regulatory reports in the way \\nthat we need it ensuring that we\\'ve got the proper controls on that  front end so we don\\'t have to do a lot of \\nthe reconciliation and manual adjustments to that data in order to get it how we needed in the report and \\nensuring we have standardized rules and controls around that process so that we can do it as efficiently as  \\npossible. But this is largely around ensuring that we improve those regulatory reports that we have to \\nproduce by starting with the underlying data that\\'s required to do that.  \\nOPERATOR:  Our next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is now open. Please \\ngo ahead.  \\nJIM MITCHELL:  Hey , good morning. Mark, consensus expectations, and it\\'s just another expense question in \\na different way. But consensus has you not hitting your revenue growth targets and you\\'re certainly free to \\ndisagree and I think that\\'s fine. But they also have your expenses at the high end of your $51 billion to $53 \\nbillion range in 2026. I guess, does that make sense or do you feel confident that if revenues do sort of \\ndisappoint your targets that you could come in at the – you should or can come in at the lower end of that \\nrange to help get to your RoTCE target.  \\nMARK MASON : Yeah. So, let\\'s take it in pieces. So I think – the first thing is that, I think Jane and I have been \\nvery consistent with trying to give guidance on full year performance for the past couple years and we\\'ve \\nlargely actually delivered on that guidance. If you look at the top line growth since Investor Day, it\\'s largely \\nconsistent with what we talked about in the medium term. If you look at the expense guidance that we\\'ve \\ngiven, largely consistent with that including this year. Even as I look at the $80 billion to $81 billion revenue \\nguidance we gave for the year, and you look at the $60.6 billion that we\\'ve done year -to-date, and you think \\nabout what we have to deliver in order to hit that target, that is achievable particularly when you remember  \\nthat we had a large Argentina devaluation last year. That fee momentum required in the fourth quarter is very \\nachievable and we believe that we will obviously hit the high end of the [expense] range for 2024.  \\nAs I think about that outer year period and the guidance that we gave there, look, you all want proof points \\nbefore you actually believe that we can deliver on that medium term target. I\\'m pointing you to proof points. \\nI\\'m hopeful that as you see those pro of points through 2024, full year and each of the quarters, that you will \\nstart to believe in that revenue momentum that\\'s required in the medium term. The fee revenue is a very good \\nindicator. What we delivered this year and this quarter is a very good in dicator of the momentum we should \\nsee across these businesses in the next couple years.  \\nI also hope that you would then see that as we deliver on the expense target that we have a path to continuing \\nto deliver on the medium -term expense target, the drivers of which I mentioned earlier. Yes, if revenues come \\nin short of the target that we\\'ve s et for ourselves, you would naturally expect for the volume and transaction \\nrelated expenses and compensation expenses to come down in a commensurate way with that revenue \\ndecline and you would also expect that we would look to see if there are other produ ctivity opportunities that \\nwe can tease out in order to still deliver on that operating efficiency target that we\\'ve set for ourselves.  \\nJIM MITCHELL: No, that\\'s great color. I appreciate it. And maybe just as a follow -up on the capital question, \\nI guess one thing that\\'s been a bit of a headwind over the last year has been sort of growth from the DTA \\ndeductions. Do we start to see that become a tailwind again? How do we think about that accreting back \\ninto capital over the next couple of years?  \\nMARK MASON : Yeah. Look, the main driver of our DTA utilization will be driving higher income in the US. \\nThat\\'s going to be the major driver and as we think about – so as you think about each of the strategies that \\nJane has described for our business, you will often hear the importance of winning in the US. You\\'ll hear it as \\nit relates to Banking and the activity that we saw, the s trong performance we saw this quarter  in Vis’s world, \\nyou hear it as it relates to the Wealth business and the importance of us growing investments particularly in \\nNorth America.  \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Third Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nOctober  15, 202 4 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   11 \\n You see it in USPB which is largely a US focused business. That DTA utilization is about us increasing net \\nincome or higher net income in the US and as we work to execute on our client driven strategy, we are looking \\nfor opportunities to do that. We\\'re inc enting the business to drive that momentum and that\\'s what\\'s going \\nto give us a higher utilization on a quarter by quarter in the coming years.  \\nOPERATOR:  Our next question will come from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is now open. Please go \\nahead.  \\nERIKA NAJARIAN:  Hi. I think we\\'ve  slid over to the afternoon. Good afternoon, guys. The first one is for you, \\nJane. As I speak with longer term investors, they often offer the commentary that clearly the path from the \\n7% RoTCE this quarter to the 11% to 12% hopefully will be bridged and to  be able to initiate a position before \\nthat progress is made, they really sort of want to see more capital optimization. And this question is not really \\nthe same question I ask you about buybacks every quarter but really m aybe a progress update on Banamex. \\nSo there is chatter in the market about Banamex needed to have four quarters of separate financials before \\nbeing IPOed and I\\'m wondering if you could give us specific progress on how that\\'s going? And Mark, maybe \\nremind u s on what Banamex\\'s contribution is as we think about the unlocking that excess capital versus \\ntaking it out of the P&L.  \\nJANE FRASER : Yeah. I\\'d be delighted to, Erika. And I would also just before I jump into Banamex point to a \\nlaser focus on capital optimization. It\\'s been a mantra for a long time in our Markets business, in Banking and \\na discipline that we\\'ve driven throughout the orga nization and I would say there isn\\'t anyone at Citi that is \\nnot keenly aware of the focus around optimizing our capital.  \\nReturning to shareholders, particularly given where we\\'re trading, and making sure that we drive to returns. \\nSo if I turn to Banamex, our singular focus right now is the separation of the two banks which we expect to \\ncomplete in the fourth quarter of this year. This has been an enormous body of work because we are creating \\neffectively de novo Mexico\\'s eighth largest bank. We\\'ve just now gotten the core regulatory authorizations \\nthat we need to proceed with separation. Although there are a few other approval s pending. We are in the \\nvery final stages and are working with our clients to prepare them for this switchover later on in Q4.  \\nOnce the separation is complete, we will turn our full attention to the IPO itself and the successful execution \\nof the IPO is the highest priority for our Head of International, Ernesto Torres Cantú , to run Banamex. And \\nour incoming Banamex Executive Chairman who starts this quarter, Ignacio Deschamps. We plan to be ready \\nto IPO at the end of 2025 based on the factors that we can control but I think as Mark and I have always said, \\nthe timing is going to be driven by market conditions to ensure we maximize t he shareholder value.  \\nAnd we\\'re making the necessary investments to continue growing share and I was very pleased that \\nBanamex outpaced the average market revenue growth year -to-date, good expense discipline being \\nmaintained despite the complex separation process and the enviro nment. So I\\'m pleased with where we are \\nand I hope that gives you a bit of a flavor of what the path ahead looks like.  \\nMARK MASON : Yeah. In terms of the second part of your question, a couple things. So, one, we\\'ve been \\nseeing good growth in our Mexico Consumer business. We\\'ve also been investing in it appropriately so to \\nmake sure that we protect the strength of that franchise as we prepare it for separation, ultimately for the \\nIPO.  \\nErika, if I understood your question right, if we turn to page 16 of the deck in the bottom right hand side, we \\nshow the P&L for Mexico Consumer for 2022 and 2023. And so you can see the contribution from a revenue \\nand expense point of view so about $1.5 b illion in 2023. And I think it\\'s about $4 billion or so of TCE that we \\nhave associated with this business. So that gives you some sense for the contribution, but it continues to \\nperform quite well as we manage it through this process.  \\nERIKA NAJARIAN:  Perfect. Thank you. And as a follow -up question, I\\'m sure it is frustrating for you to see \\nthe stock reaction in a quarter where you had PPNR strength and better expectations for net interest income \\nin the fourth quarter. So maybe I\\'ll frame the question t his way for you, Mark.  \\nAs we think about the gyrations in interest rate expectations globally, may be remind us sort of is it fair to \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Third Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nOctober  15, 202 4 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   12 \\n assume that Citi is asset sensitive internationally and neutrally positioned domestically? How should we \\nthink about late fees? I know you told us that late fees going to $8 were  part of your initial guide for the year. \\nAnd additionally, I think perhaps because capital markets is so strong across the board, across all of your \\npeers, maybe that\\'s not why you\\'re getting, \"credit for your strength this quarter\". So as we look into 20 25 \\nand having NIR be that bigger contribution to your revenue CAGR, maybe walk  us through what are the other \\nsort of core fee strengths that we should look for other than FICC and Banking remaining strong and coming \\nback that could bring you to that path to 2026.  \\nMARK MASON : Okay. There\\'s a lot there. But thank you. Thank you for the question. I would like to see the \\nstock reacting much more favorably because this really has been a strong quarter for us and in fact as you \\nmentioned, NII when you look through it, we\\'ve in fact taken our NII guidance up just a tad bit as we \\nreferenced that the full year would be slightly down versus modestly down with the fourth quarter that\\'s flat \\nto the third quarter and so that is an important takeaway.  \\nI mentioned the headwinds and tailwinds earlier and we shouldn\\'t lose sight of those. We will get lift from \\nreinvesting the securities as those mature, we will continue to see volume growth and those are important \\ndrivers of tailwind activity for us.  \\nYou rightfully mentioned our interest rate exposure analysis that we do on a quarterly basis that reflects the \\nasset sensitivity of our business. And last quarter it was about $1.6 billion or so of a negative, assuming 100 \\nbasis point decline across the cu rve, assuming a static balance sheet and cross -currencies. And as you look \\nat that asset  sensitivity, again, you rightfully pointed out that we skew non -US in terms of the magnitude of \\nthat decline in NII should we see that parallel shift.  \\nAnd in fact, it\\'s as much as $1.3 billion or so of that $1.6 billion is non -US dollar related across 60 currencies. \\nAnd so you\\'d have to see all of that move in tandem for that drag and the US dollar drag is about $300 million \\nassuming 100 basis point shif t and that\\'s been coming down. If you look back over the quarters, we\\'ve been \\nthoughtfully managing that down and that\\'s down to about $300 million number. I would expect when we \\nprint the third quarter Q, it will be down a bit more. And so, again, we are asset sensitive but it does skew \\noutside of the US and thank you for asking the question because I think it\\'s important to remind our investors \\nand analysts of that dynamic which in many ways may be different from that of other Institutions.  \\nIn terms of the late fees, we did say that we were including late fees in our assumptions, in our outlook that \\nwe\\'ve given. I\\'ll state the obvious Erika, which is that we want people to obviously pay on time and we do \\neverything that we can to assist and e nsure that they do that. With that said, we don\\'t have a definitive \\ntimeline on late fees, nor are we overly reliant on late fees to drive revenue for our firm. And so it looks like \\nthat decisioning will likely kind of fall closer to sometime in 2025 and s o there is a small adjustment in the \\nlast quarter of our revenue forecast but it\\'s inside of the guidance that we gave and doesn\\'t materially change \\nthat in any way.  \\nAnd then the last part of your question, I think, was around NIR and the fee revenue. And as I mentioned \\nearlier, I\\'m not going to give guidance for 2025 but I think your question was around where are we likely to \\nsee continued momentum as it relates to fe e revenue growth. And I would start with Services where fees \\nwere up some 33% year -over -year and yes we should adjust for the Argentine Peso devaluation. But even if \\nyou adjust for that it\\'s double -digit, 11% year -over -year non -interest revenue growth. And  when you look at \\nthose drivers they\\'ve been consistently strong. Cross -border transaction value up 8%, US dollar clearing \\nvolume up 7%, commercial card spend up 8%. In the supplement you\\'ll see that it\\'s mid to high single digit \\nyear -to-date growth across  those KPIs as well. We expect that that will continue with our corporate clients \\nand as we bring on new commercial clients as well.  \\nI\\'ll turn you to – if you look at Banking, we talked about already so I won\\'t kind of lean into that too much but \\nexcept to highlight a really strong quarter in Banking, in Investment Banking fees, in particular, the rebound \\nthat we\\'ve been talking about b ut importantly us capturing share in that rebound and these important \\npartnerships that position us well as sponsors start to lean back into the market the investments that we\\'ve \\nbeen making in talent, in sectors we need to strengthen. All of those things are going to play to continued fee \\nmomentum as we go into 2025.  \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Third Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nOctober  15, 202 4 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   13 \\n Wealth, again, really strong performance this quarter with revenues up 9%. But look at the client investment \\nassets, up 24%. The client balances up 14%. That\\'s driving fee momentum and it\\'s a keen area of focus for \\nAndy and that team that he\\'s pulled toget her and it\\'s a real opportunity for us given the $5 trillion or so of \\nassets that our clients hold away from us and we\\'re better positioning ourselves to capture that. And then \\nfinally, you can see kind of continued momentum on USPB but it\\'s across the boa rd is what I\\'m saying, Erika, \\nin terms of that fee momentum and it is important. It\\'s an important aspect as we think about getting to \\nthose medium term targets and that 4% to 5% revenue.  \\nOPERATOR:  Our next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open. Please go \\nahead.  \\nGERARD CASSIDY:  Hi, Mark , hi, Jane.  \\nMARK MASON : Good morning.  \\nGERARD CASSIDY: Mark, you touched on in your prepared comments about growing the US Personal \\nBanking RoTCE to higher levels. And you mentioned two items. One, innovative products and the \\nnormalization of credit costs. Can you elaborate on those two items that will be contributing to the driver \\naside from the efficiency improvement that you also touched on ? \\nMARK MASON : Yeah, sure. So obviously USPB is a combination of the cards businesses that we have in the \\nRetail Banking business and that cards portfolio has both Branded as well as Retail Services as part of it. And \\neven within Branded, we have proprietary cards where we frankly have been looking to how we can come up \\nwith new innovative products. One example of product innovation is the recent refresh that we did of our \\nStrata Premier Card which was designed to drive acquisition and engagement with a new re wards offering. \\nAnd with that acquisitions are up some 7% both quarter -over -quarter and year -over -year for Branded Cards \\nso that\\'s an example of product innovation.  \\nAnother one is we also launched FlexPay at Costco a few quarters ago and you can see good instalment loan \\ngrowth as a consequence of that, up some 15% or so. And so that type of product creation is important to \\nacquisitions, it\\'s important to ensuring the card stays top of wallet and important to driving some of that top \\nline performance. And then the other thing that I mentioned, you\\'re right was around cost of credit and that \\nreally is the continued normalization of cost of credit. I mentioned a couple of  times now the idea that \\nmultiple vintages are maturing at the same time. And that has to play through for us to kind of see a more \\nnormal level of credit and that will be important to the returns. And again, we are starting to see stabilization \\nin both th e cost of credit line but also in delinquencies and that\\'s a good indicator for us.  \\nGERARD CASSIDY:  Very good. And then just following up on credit. In the Banking division, you guys \\nmentioned the cost of credit was, I think, $1 77 million due to ACL build of $141 million. And it was due to a \\nchange in the mix in the portfolio. Can you share with  us what that mix change was that drove this provision?  \\nMARK MASON : It\\'s a mix of kind of different asset classes and clients that we\\'ve lent against. There\\'s nothing \\nmaterial or significant in that number. When you look at the nonaccrual loans that ratio still 31 basis points. \\nSo it\\'s a mix change of our exposures but not hing material there.  \\nJANE FRASER : And we continue to see a very healthy corporate sector really across the world.  \\nOPERATOR:  Our next question will come from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. \\nPlease go ahead.  \\nVIVEK JUNEJA:  Hi. Two questions, Jane and Mark. One is on expenses and the other is on your response to \\nthe asset cap question before. So first one, expenses, an easier one. Earlier in the year you had said you \\nexpect about $700 million to $1 billion of severance charge s in the $53.5 billion to $53.8 billion. Did you have \\nany in the third quarter? Expect any if the fourth? And do you expect to be done with those this year or any \\nto continue into next year too?  \\nMARK MASON : Yeah. So that number was a combination of restructuring charges and severance charges or \\nrepositioning charges and we breakout obviously restructuring so that you can see those. And this \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Third Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nOctober  15, 202 4 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   14 \\n restructuring component was largely driven by the org simplification. That will be done this year. The normal \\nseverance or repositioning charges that we take as a normal course of BAU you would expect that to occur \\nin any year and it certainly will be part  of 2025 and 2026 going forward. We did have some this quarter. I \\nwould expect that we will have some next quarter, but I don\\'t see us being outside of by any stretch the range \\nthat I gave and again the range was for the combination of both.  \\nVIVEK JUNEJA:  Okay. Thanks on that. And shifting to the asset cap question, Jane and Mark, we didn\\'t hear \\na clear answer on, A, do you have an asset cap? And B, even if you don\\'t, what is the effective implication or \\nimpact of what the regulators have said?  \\nJANE FRASER : So let me be crystal clear. We do not have an asset cap and there are no additional measures \\nother than what was announced in July in place and not expecting any. So the implications of what we\\'re \\ndoing is as I\\'ve laid out, we\\'ve increased investments in t he areas where we were behind, particularly in the \\ndata related to our regulatory processes and regulatory reporting. We\\'re increasing investment behind it. And \\nwe continue to make progress, material progress on the orders in place including c losing the BSA/AML order \\nthis quarter. The third order closed since 2021.  \\nVIVEK JUNEJA:  And you don\\'t expect anything meaningful, Jane, that will impact business like there was this \\nnew story about China, some license that you didn\\'t get approved by the regulator s. Anything more \\nmeaningful like that that might be occurring that may be...  \\nJANE FRASER : Absolutely – let me be crystal clear, absolutely nothing.  \\nVIVEK JUNEJA:  Okay. Great. Thank you . \\nOPERATOR:  Our next question will come from the line of Matt O\\'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is \\nnow open. Please go ahead.  \\nMATT O\\'CONNO R: Hi. Just a couple of clarification questions. I guess first on Banamex, are you on track to \\nstill IPO it the fourth quarter of next year or does it just get pushed out by a quarter with the legal separation \\ntaking a little bit longer?  \\nJANE FRASER : Look, I think as I mentioned in response to Erika\\'s question, we plan to be ready to IPO at the \\nend of 2025 based on the factors we can control. The timing is going to get driven by how we maximize \\nshareholder value and that will be market conditions. So that\\'s where we stand.  \\nMATT O\\'CONNOR:  Okay. I think that means by the end of 2025, you talk about 1Q 2026, that was kind of my \\nclarification question on that. I thought you needed four quarters after you legally separated it to officially \\nIPO it.  \\nJANE FRASER : We believe as we stand at the moment we would be ready to IPO at the end of 2025. It\\'s much \\nmore a focus on what the market conditions at that point will be and Mark and I are very, very much focused \\non the shareholder value and maximizing that over – rush ing over one quarter versus another quarter.  \\nMARK MASON : And there\\'s no hard rule on – sorry, go ahead.  \\nJANE FRASER : Yes, there isn\\'t a hard rule on you have to have got four quarters after you have separated.  \\nMATT O\\'CONNOR:  I see. Okay. That\\'s super helpful. We just haven\\'t had that many of these, so that\\'s helpful. \\nAnd then just separately I think in the prepared remarks you guys mentioned a modest provision within \\nServices for some of the unremitted corporate dividends and I just wanted to clarify that and what country \\nis that. And I guess I thought there wasn\\'t really much liability to you guys from that, so any clarification on \\nthat. I know it\\'s a small amount, but that would be helpful. Thank you.  \\nMARK MASON : Sure. It\\'s a small amount. In the back of the deck, we have a page on Russia exposure. It\\'s \\nrelated to that.  \\nMATT O\\'CONNOR:  Okay. But still feel like there\\'s not risk to you guys from all those kind of trapped \\ndividends, I guess why take a small reserve if there\\'s legally no risk to you guys?  \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Third Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nOctober  15, 202 4 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   15 \\n MARK MASON : Well, it\\'s the way we treat the exposure there. We\\'re following the guidelines on how we need \\nto treat exposures in the country that we aren\\'t able to distribute to clients but we actually have to hold on \\ntheir behalf. And so we have to book a reserve asso ciated with that and so we do that. We obviously show on \\nthe page what the exposure is in the event of a loss of control and you can kind of see how that ultimately \\nnets out but we\\'re following the appropriate guidelines for what\\'s required for  reserves of that nature.  \\nMATT O\\'CONNOR:  Got it. Okay. Thank you.  \\nMARK MASON : Yeah.  \\nOPERATOR:  Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Kenny with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now \\nopen. Please go ahead.  \\nRYAN KENNY:  Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I have one for Mark. So  you mentioned that Services NII \\nis a tailwind as rates decline. Can you just unpack how that happens? Is there any benefit from swap roll -off \\nor a floating swap that we should be thinking about that\\'s embedded in that statement?  \\nMARK MASON : There are a couple of things kind of to keep in mind on the Services business. So, one is, is \\nobviously this is a client business. It\\'s not just a deposit taking business and so how we think about pricing \\nto those client becomes really important. You\\'ve go t the US and non -US dynamic that\\'s playing through. For \\ninstitutional clients, we\\'ve largely been holding to the higher betas that we saw as rates have ticked up. \\nAgain, with the relationship in mind. And we have some offsetting pressure outsid e of the US as those betas \\nkind of catch up. But I think importantly you also heard me mention the reinvestment into securities at higher \\nyields and that reinvestment or those higher yields ultimately play out through the businesses and so that \\nwill show u p as part of kind of NII as we think about Services but the other businesses as well. And so those \\nare important components of the NII story for Services.  \\nI think when you look at the in -quarter performance and [TTS]  NII is down 5%, a big part of that is driven by \\nthe Argentina rates movement in the quarter versus last year, so lower rates we\\'re earning in Argentina \\nplaying through that line particularly in this quarter. If you adjusted for that on the NII line, it wou ld be flat to \\nslightly a little bit better. So that\\'s really what it is. It\\'s kind of management of client relationships as well as \\nthe higher earnings on reinvested securities contributing to t hat as well as volume from operating account \\ngrowth that we expect.  \\nRYAN KENNY:  Thank you.  \\nOPERATOR:  Our next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with HSBC. Your line is now open. Please \\ngo ahead.  \\nSAUL MARTINEZ:  Hey, guys. Couple quick questions. First, just a follow -up on Banamex. Jane, as you know, \\nthere are concerns about judicial reform in Mexico and the implications for rule of law and  Mexican asset \\nprices have suffered as a result. I think the largest Mexican bank trades at something in the neighborhood of \\nseven times earnings. If market conditions don\\'t improve and Mexican asset prices remain depressed and \\nthese concerns persist, then  what? I mean, do you just wait until market conditions impr ove or how do you \\nthink about this process in the context of what seems  to be a deteriorating macro backdrop for Mexico.  \\nJANE FRASER : Yeah. We\\'ve got to wait and see what the market conditions will be but the North Star for me \\nand for Mark is crystal clear, it is optimizing  and  maximizing our shareholder value. So if the conditions are \\nnot appropriate at that time then we will wait until they are. In the meantime, the business is performing well. \\nIt\\'s accretive to our returns. It\\'s not a drag here in any shape or form so there i s no need to rush for a \\nsuboptimal result here. But we will IPO and we will exit Banamex, but we wo n\\'t do that in a reckless manner. \\nWe will be disciplined about it as you would expect us to be and as I think we\\'re demonstrating that we are \\non multiple different dimensions.  \\nSAUL MARTINEZ:  Okay. Fair enough. And then I guess a follow -up on the US Personal Banking, RoTCE \\nimprovement and the normalization of the cost of credit seems to be a big component of that. But Mark can \\nyou just remind us where you are in terms of cost of credit versus w hat you would think a more normalized \\nlevel is for Branded Cards and Retail Services. I guess how much of a tailwind does a more normalized credit \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Third Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nOctober  15, 202 4 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   16 \\n environment entail in terms of credit cost?  \\nMARK MASON : Again, I don\\'t want to get into 2025 at this stage. I assure you, we will give more color and \\ncommentary on that as we get into the fourth quarter earnings in January. What I will say again, as you think \\nabout these businesses, we do see continued top line  – we do expect continued top line momentum. We\\'ve \\nhad eight consecutive quarters of positive operating leverage in USPB, 49% [efficiency ratio]  this quarter. So \\nwe\\'re managing the expense base well. We think there\\'s more upside to the top line . We\\'re very focused on \\ngrowth across the portfolios and I do think that cost of credit again, if for no other reason but the \\ncompounding effect of those vintages maturing as well as kind of inflation starting to come off, rates trickling \\ndown, that should  be better for the consumer and should start to play out in both the macroeconomic \\nscenarios that we run for CECL purposes but also ultimately in delinquencies and NCLs and we\\'re starting to \\nsee that improvement in delinquencies and its stabilization alrea dy somewhat. So I don\\'t want to get into \\nguidance. But that\\'s kind of how I think about the drivers or contributors to improve returns over the medium \\nterm.  \\nOPERATOR:  Our next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. \\nPlease go ahead.  \\nMIKE MAYO:  Hi. Thanks for the clarification on the asset cap question that I asked earlier. And I know you \\nare limited in how much you can say about regulators but just be clear, because a lot of e -mail traffic going \\nback, you did say there is no asset cap and you do n\\'t expect one and you don\\'t expect other additional \\nactions at this time ? \\nJANE FRASER : Correct.  \\nMIKE MAYO : Okay. Thank you for clarifying that. And I guess, look, I have great respect , I\\'m an ex -regulator, \\nPaul Volcker was my hero. I respect regulators. And nobody wants to see you cut corners to get to your $51 \\nbillion to $53 billion of expenses. But I\\'m just wondering – and you have consolidated systems apps, layers, \\nbureaucracy and yo u\\'re divesting lots of activit ies. So it\\'s just even the amended consent order was surprising \\nbecause you have taken so many efforts and if you should have had an amend ed consent order or other \\nactions, they probably should have been in place one, five, 10 or literally 20 years ago. And so that\\'s just \\nconfusing on the outside. So with that said, is this a matter of spending more money or about doing these \\ntasks more inte lligently? In other words, you put more gas in the tank, the car\\'s not going faster. So is it \\namount of resources or just being more intelligent in terms of resolving some of these regulatory issues?  \\nJANE FRASER : So let me break it down to a couple of pieces. So I start off just remind everyone the consent \\norders are very, very broad and the action that was taken was because we\\'re behind in a narrower area which \\nis the data particularly regarding our regulatory rep orting where we\\'re behind is the main area of focus. We \\nmoved swiftly to address it.  \\nWe\\'re very transparent about it from early on in the year that we were falling behind on this and overall I\\'m \\npleased with our progress. And as you say, Mike, I listed a number of areas of progress and trying to make it \\nas tangible as we can, given what we  can and can\\'t say as this is supervisory . I\\'m pleased that our businesses \\ncontinue to improve their performance while the transformation is going on. They\\'re the two priorities we \\nhave this year so I think effectively, yes, we can walk and chew gum at the  same time and the huge benefit of  \\nall of the simplification on the business, on the organization, the other efforts, is making it easier for us to \\nexecute and be very focused.  \\nAnd well maybe, Mark, I ’ll pass it over to you.  \\nMARK MASON : I think your question\\'s helpful in the sense that you said is it kind of a rethink on our approach \\nor is it the need to spend more money and one of the things that we\\'ve done, Mike, is take a step back and \\nlook at how we\\'ve been approaching data, for examp le. So this is – and we are going to make – we have made \\nsome changes to our approach and those changes relate to how we get after resolving data issues that are \\nidentified ensuring that there\\'s engagement from the front end business, from the functions that are most \\nrelevant and that there\\'s consideration for what\\'s required on reg reporting in order for us to get that process \\nstreamlined and correct.  \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Third Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nOctober  15, 202 4 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   17 \\n And so there are aspects of this that require a change in our approach and we\\'ve been taking that change, \\nmaking that change rather , and we\\'ll make more changes accordingly as we\\'ve taken that step back and \\nthere are aspects of it that require at a minimum review of what is causing either the delay or us not moving \\nat the pace that we would like to move or that our regulators would like . And that is in fact what the resource \\nreview plan was that was in the amended consent order. It was basically a statement  saying that you need \\nto ensure that you have sufficient resources and that they\\'re allocated towards achieving the timely and \\nsustainable compliance.  \\nAnd so part of our process is in fact that. Taking a regular review of what is on track in the way of our \\nmilestones and deliverables where we see things that are being delayed or going red, what is the underlying \\nroot cause for why. Is it a resource issue  where we need to put more dollars and people or technology to it? \\nIs it a process issue where we need to reconsider our approach? And on the other side of that root cause, \\ntaking action to fix it.  \\nAnd so your question is spot -on. The answer is that in many instances it will be a little bit of both , but \\nimportantly our processes include that type of analysis and assessment so that we can get after the \\nexecution on this in an effective way. I hope that helps.  \\nJANE FRASER:  And all of this drives  productivity and other benefits for our shareholders as well as making \\nsure that we\\'re strengthening Citi from the regulatory perspective.  \\nMIKE MAYO:  And then last follow -up. To the extent that you see a disconnect between your performance \\nand the stock price that would seem to create more of an opportunity to buy the stock at $64 when tangible \\nbook value is $90. And so, I hope that – I\\'ve used this ana logy before, but hopefully you\\'re selling the chairs \\nand the desk and the silverware in the executive dining room to go ahead and buy back stock whenever you \\ncan.  \\nJANE FRASER : It\\'s clearly given where we are trading, we\\'re very focused around the opportunities to buy \\nback stock and mindful of the importance of it and equally, yes, we are proud of the performance of the \\nfranchise this quarter. It was a very strong quarter and imp ortant set of proof points for our investors. We are \\non a deliberate path. We\\'re making the progress that we need to and actually pretty excited about the path \\nahead of us and the potential that we see.  \\nOPERATOR:  There are no further questions. I\\'ll now turn the call over to Jenn Landis for closing remarks.  \\nJENNIFER LANDIS:  Thank you, everyone, for joining the call. Please follow -up with IR if you have any \\nadditional questions.

I am joined today by our Chief Executive Officer, Jane Fraser , and our Chief Financial \\nOfficer, Mark Mason.  \\n \\nI\\'d like to remind you that today\\'s presenta tion, which is available for download on our website, \\ncitigroup.com, may  contain forward -looking statements which are based on management\\'s current \\nexpectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ \\nmaterial ly from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our earnings \\nmaterials as well as in our SEC filing s. \\n \\nAnd with that, I\\'ll turn it over to Jane.  \\n \\nJANE FRASER : Thank you, Jenn, and good morning to everyone. Before I discus s the results of the quarter, \\nlet me first address the regulatory actions by the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the \\nCurrency which were announced on Wednesday.  These actions pertain to the consent orders we entered \\ninto with both age ncies in 2020 and those orders covered four primary areas: risk management, data \\ngovernance, controls and compliance. Addressing these areas is the primary goal of our Transformation, \\nour number one priority. It is a multi -year effort to modernize our infr astructure, unify disparate tech \\nmanagement. We have been public this year about the fact that we were behind in this particular area and \\nthat we had incre ased our investment as a result. The regulatory actions consisted of two civil money \\npenalties and, under the amended consent order with the OCC, a new process designed to ensure we are \\nallocating sufficient resources to meet our remediation milestones, ca lled the Resource Review Plan. We \\nare currently developing the Plan for submission to the OCC.  \\n \\nBy way of background, while the Federal Reserve is the primary regulator for Citigroup, our bank holding \\ncompany, the OCC is the primary regulator for Citibank , N.A. or CBNA, which is our largest banking vehicle \\nwith approximately 70% of our assets. The amended consent order with the OCC allows CBNA, to continue \\npaying to Citigroup, at a minimum, the dividends necessary for debt service, preferred dividends, and  other \\nnon -discretionary obligations. While we are developing and seeking OCC consent for our Resource Review \\n-objection. These dividends are \\nintercompany payments that are made from CBNA ultimat ely to the parent, Citigroup. They should not be \\nconfused with the common dividends Citigroup pays to its shareholders. Indeed, there is no restriction on \\nk \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Second  Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nJuly 12, 202 4 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   2 \\n shares. And let me be very clear, even with the investments needed for our Transformation, Citigroup has \\nmore than sufficient resources to also invest in our businesses, and make the planned return of capital to \\nour shareholders. We will increase our div idend from 53 to 56 cents a share, as we announced in late June, \\nand will resume modest buybacks this quarter.  \\n \\nWhile these actions were not entirely unexpected to us, it is no doubt disappointing for our investors and \\nour people. We completely understand that. At the same time, we are confident in our ability to get these \\nspecific areas where they need to be, as we have been able to do in other areas of the Transformation. And \\nwe are pleased that it was acknowledged on Wednesday that we have made meaningfu l progress in \\nexecuting our Transformation, and simplifying our firm. A multi -year undertaking such as this was never \\ngoing to be linear. The investments we have been making are starting to come together to reduce risk, \\nimprove controls and deliver tangibl e outcomes. The tech investments we have made are making a \\ndifference. We have reduced the time it takes to book loans; automated controls for our traders to reduce \\nerrors; moved risk analytics to a cloud -based infrastructure; and increased the resiliency of our platforms \\nto reduce downtime. The changes to our organization and our culture are making a difference. We have \\neliminated managerial constructs and layers whilst empowering our leaders. We introduced new tools to \\nbetter manage human capital needs. O ur focus on culture has increased accountability and attracted great \\ncommitment that we will address any area of the consent order where we are behind by putting the \\nnecessary resources and focus behind it. We will get this work where it needs to be, as we have with the \\nexecution of our strategy and the simplification of our organization.  \\n \\nNow, turning to what was another good quarter, our results show the  relentless focus we have in executing \\nour strategy as we continue to drive towards our medium -term return targets. We reported net income of \\n$3.2 billion with an earnings per share of $1.52 and an ROTCE of 7.2%. Revenues were up 4% overall, as well \\nas up in each of our five core businesses, where all but one had positive operating leverage. Expenses were \\ndown 2% year -over -year. The steps we are taking to simplify our organization, right -size businesses such \\nas Markets and Wealth, and reduce stranded costs are beginning to take hold, even as we increase \\ninvestment in our Transformation. Over the medium term, we expect these simplification and stranded cost \\nactions to drive the $2 to $2.5 billion in annual run -rate saves. Services grew 3% driven by solid fee growth, \\nwhich we have prioritized. TTS saw increased activity in cross border payments and in commercial cards. \\nSecurities Services was up 10%, with new client onboardings, deepening with existing clients, and market \\nvaluations helping increase our assets under custody by a preliminary 9%. At our recent Services Investor \\nDay, we very much enjoyed the opportunity to talk to you in -depth about how we are going to continue to \\ngrow this high -returning business. And we are very pleased that people are starting t o recognize why we \\ndescribe it as our crown jewel.  \\n \\nOverall, Markets had a strong finish to the quarter leading to better performance than we had anticipated. \\nFixed Income was slightly down year -on-year due to lower FX and Rates, but we had good issuance and \\nloan growth in Financing & Securitization, an area which generates attractive returns. Equities was up 37%, \\ndriven by strong performance in derivatives which includes a gain on the Visa B exchange offer.  \\n \\nBanking was up 38% as the wallet rebound gained some momentum and we again grew share. Our clients \\ncontinued to access the debt capital markets with investment grade issuance near record levels. Equity \\nissuance increased, particularly in convertibles, as c ompanies wait for a fuller opening of the IPO window. \\nInvestment Banking fees were up 63% versus the prior year. We have seen some healthy volumes \\nassociated with announced deals year to date, particularly in Natural Resources and Technology. \\nCombined with  a strong pipeline, advisory activity looks promising as we think about the rest of the year \\nand into next year.  \\n \\nWealth is starting to improve. Growth in client investment assets drove stronger Investment revenue, \\nespecially in Citigold, and was up a preliminary 15%. Our focus on rationalizing the expense base is starting \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Second  Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nJuly 12, 202 4 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   3 \\n to pay off, with expenses down 4%. Andy and his team continue to attract top talent from the industry as \\nthey focus on our investments business and on enhancing the client experience.  \\n \\nU.S. Personal Banking saw revenue growth of 6%, with all three businesses again contributing to the \\ntopline. There was good revolving balance and loan growth in both branded cards and retail services. We \\ncontinue to see differentiation in the credit segm ents with the lower income customers seeing pressure.  \\nRetail Banking benefitted from higher mortgage loans and improved deposit spreads, while delivering \\nstrong referrals to Wealth. Overall, while we saw operating margin expansion, our poor returns were \\npressured by the combination of credit seasonality and the normalization of certain vintages. We certainly \\n \\n \\nThe recent stress tests again showcased the strength of our balance sheet. Our CET1 ratio now stands at \\n13.6%, and we expect our regulatory capital requirement to decrease to 12.1% as of October 1st given the \\nreduction of our stress capital buffer. Our tangible book value per share grew to $87.53. During the quarter, \\nwe returned $1 billion in capital to our c ommon shareholders, and we are increasing our dividend by 6%. We \\nexpect to buyback $1 billion in common shares this quarter and we will continue to assess the level of \\nbuybacks on a quarterly basis, particularly given the uncertainty around the Basel III e ndgame.  \\n \\nstructurally sound economy. After a break in progress, inflation now appears back on a downward \\ntrajectory. Services spending has remaine d on an upward trend although there are clear signs of a softening \\nlabor market and the tightening of the consumer budget. And of course, you might have heard there is an \\nmpetitiveness continues \\nto be a drag on growth. In Asia, China is growing moderately, albeit with government stimulus, and their \\npivot to high -tech manufacturing is being challenged by tariffs on EVs and semi -conductors. Despite this \\nuncertainty, as you sa w at our Services Investor Day, when we went through our performance over the last \\ntwo years, our business model can produce good results in a variety of macro environments. And there is \\nplenty of upside for us across our five businesses.  \\n \\nWe have made an  incredible amount of progress in simplification - both strategically and organizationally. \\nWe have completed most of the exits of our international consumer markets. We streamlined our \\norganization to catalyze agility and faster decision making. We are mod ernizing our infrastructure to \\nimprove our client service and automating processes to strengthen controls. We are on a deliberate path. \\nWe will continue to execute our Transformation and our strategy so we can meet our medium -term targets \\nand then continue  to further improve our returns over time. With that, I would like to turn it over to Mark \\nand then we would be delighted, as always, to take your questions.  \\n \\nMARK MASON : Thanks, Jane and good morning, everyone. I am going to start with the firmwide financ ial \\nresults, focusing on year -over -year comparisons for the second quarter unless I indicate otherwise, and then \\nspend a little more time on the businesses.  \\nOn slide 6, we show financial results for the full firm. For the quarter, we reported net income o f \\napproximately $3.2 billion, EPS of $1.52 and an RoTCE of 7.2% on $20.1 billion of revenues.  Total revenues \\nwere up 4%, driven by growth across all businesses as well as an approximate $400 million gain related to \\nthe Visa B exchange offer. A significant portion of this gain is reflected in Equity Markets, with the remainder \\nreflected in All Other.  Expenses were $13.4 billion, down 2%, and 6% on a sequential basis.  The combination \\nof revenue growth and expense decline drove positive operating leverage for the firm and the majority of our \\nbusinesses.  Cost of credit was $2.5 billion, primarily driven by higher Card net credit losses, which were \\npartially offset by ACL releases in all businesses except USPB, where we built for loan growth.  At the end of \\nthe q uarter, we had nearly $22 billion in total reserves with a reserve -to-funded loans ratio of approximately \\n2.7%.  \\nOn slide 7, we show the expense trend over the past five quarters.  This quarter we reported expenses of \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Second  Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nJuly 12, 202 4 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   4 \\n $13.4 billion, down 2%, and 6% sequenti ally, which includes the $136 million civil money penalties imposed \\nby the Fed and OCC earlier this week.  The decrease in expenses was primarily driven by savings associated \\nwith our organizational simplification, stranded cost reductions, and lower reposi tioning costs, partially \\noffset by continued investment in Transformation and the Fed and the OCC penalties.  As we said over the \\npast few months, we will continue to invest in the Transformation and technology to modernize our \\noperations and risk and cont rol infrastructure. We expect these investments to offset some of our saves and \\nheadcount reduction going forward.  However, based on what we now know today, we will likely be at the \\nhigher end of the expense guidance range, excluding the FDIC special asse ssment and the civil money \\npenalties. With that said, we will, of course, look for opportunities to absorb the CMP.   \\non the Transformation and a ddress what the Fed and OCC announced Wednesday.  We have made good \\nprogress on our Transformation in certain areas over the last few years, and I want to highlight some of those \\nareas before discussing the announcement.  First, Wholesale Credit and Loan o perations, where we \\nimplemented a consistent end to end operating model and consolidated multiple systems with enhanced \\ntechnology. This has not only reduced risk but enhanced operating efficiency and the client experience.  We \\nhave also made improvements in risk and compliance as we enhanced our risk assessments and technology \\ncapabilities to increase automation for monitoring.  And in Data, while there is a lot more to do, we have \\nstood up a data governance process and streamlined our data architecture to  ultimately facilitate straight \\nthrough processing.  Overall, we have improved risk management, and consolidated and upgraded systems \\nand platforms to improve our resiliency.  These efforts represent meaningful examples of how we are making \\nprogress against  our Transformation milestones.  That said, we have fallen short in data quality management \\nparticularly related to regulatory reporting, which we have acknowledged publicly since the beginning of the \\nyear.  As such, we have begun to put additional investm ents and resources in place to not only address data \\nquality management related to regulatory reporting and data governance, but also related to stress testing \\ncapabilities, including DFAST and Resolution Recovery. We also re -prioritized our efforts to ens ure we are \\nfocused on data that impacts these reports first.  We take this feedback from our regulators very seriously \\nand we are committed to allocating all the resources necessary to meet their expectations.   \\nNow turning back to the quarterly results . On slide 9, we show net interest income, deposits, and loans where \\n In the second quarter, net interest income was roughly flat.  Excluding \\nMarkets, net interest income was down 3%, largely driven by the impact of foreign exchange translation, \\nseasonally lower revolving card balances and lower interest rates in Argentina, partially offset by higher \\ndeposit spreads in Wealth. Average loans were roughly flat, as growth in Cards and Mexico Consumer was \\nlargely offset by slight declines across businesses. And average deposits decreased by 1%, largely driven by \\nseasonal outflows and transfers to investments in Wealth as well as non -operati onal outflows in TTS.  \\nOn slide 10, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics, which reflect our disciplined risk appetite \\nframework.  Across our card portfolios, approximately 86% of our card loans are to consumers with FICO \\nscores of 660 or higher . And while we continue to see an overall resilient US consumer, we also continue to \\nsee a divergence in performance and behavior across FICO and income bands.  When we look across our \\nconsumer clients, only the highest income quartile has more savings than  they did at the beginning of 2019.  \\nAnd it is the over 740 FICO customers that are driving the spend growth and maintaining high payment rates. \\nLower FICO band customers are seeing sharper drops in payment rates and borrowing more as they are more \\nacutely impacted by high inflation and interest rates.  That said, as we will discuss later, we are seeing signs \\nof stabilization in delinquency performance across our cards portfolios.  And we have taken this all into \\naccount in our reserving and we remain well res erved with a reserve -to-funded loan ratio of 8.1% for our total \\ncard portfolio. Our Corporate portfolio is largely investment grade, at approximately 82% as of the second \\nquarter.  And we saw a nearly $500 million sequential decrease in corporate non -accrua l loans, largely driven \\nby upgrades and repayments. Additionally, this quarter we saw an improvement in our macro assumptions \\ndriven by HPI, oil prices and equity market valuations.  And our credit loss reserves continue to incorporate a \\nscenario -weighted a verage unemployment rate of nearly 5%, and a downside scenario unemployment rate \\nof nearly 7%.  As such, we feel very comfortable with the nearly $22 billion of reserves that we have in the \\ncurrent environment.  \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Second  Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nJuly 12, 202 4 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   5 \\n \\nt to highlight the strength of our balance sheet, capital and \\nliquidity. It is this strength that allows us to support clients through periods of uncertainty and volatility.  Our \\nbalance sheet is a reflection of our risk appetite, strategy and diversified b usiness model.  Our $1.3 trillion \\ndeposit base is well diversified across regions, industries, customers and account types.  The majority of our \\ndeposits are corporate, at $807 billion, and span 90 countries.  And as you heard at the Services ID, most of \\nthese deposits are held in operating accounts that are crucial to how our clients fund their daily operations \\naround the world, making them operational in nature and therefore very stable.  The majority of our \\nremaining deposits, about $404 billion, are well  diversified across the Private Bank, Citigold, Retail and \\nWealth at Work offerings, as well as across regions and products.  Of our total deposits, 68% are US dollar \\ndenominated with the remainder spanning over 60 currencies.  Our asset mix also reflects ou r strong risk \\nappetite framework.  Our $688 billion loan portfolio is well diversified across consumer and corporate loans.  \\nAnd about one -third of our balance sheet is held in cash and high -quality, short duration investment \\nsecurities that contribute to o ur approximately $900 billion of available liquidity resources.  We continue to \\nfeel very good about the strength of our balance sheet and the quality of our assets and liabilities, which \\nposition us to be a source of strength for the industry and, importan tly, for our clients.  \\nOn slide 12, we show a sequential walk to provide more detail on the drivers of our CET1 ratio this quarter.  \\nWe ended the quarter with a preliminary 13.6% CET1 capital ratio, approximately 130 basis points, or \\napproximately $15 bill ion, above our current regulatory capital requirement of 12.3%.  We expect our \\nregulatory capital requirement to decrease to 12.1% as of October 1st, which incorporates the reduction in \\nour Stress Capital Buffer from 4.3% to the indicative SCB of 4.1% we an nounced a couple weeks ago.  We \\nwere pleased to see the improvement in our DFAST results, and the corresponding reduction in our SCB.  That \\nsaid, even with the reduction, our capital requirement does not yet fully reflect our simplification efforts, the \\nbene fits of our transformation or the full execution of our strategy, all of which we expect to reduce our \\ncapital requirements over time.  And as a reminder, we announced an increase to our common dividend from \\n$0.53 per share to $0.56 per share following the SCB results.  And as Jane mentioned earlier, we plan on \\ndoing $1 billion of buybacks this quarter.  \\nSo now turning to slide 13. Before I get into the businesses, as a reminder, in the fourth quarter of last year, \\nwe implemented a revenue sharing arrangement  within Banking, and between Banking, Services and \\nMarkets to reflect the benefit the businesses get from our relationship -based lending. The impact of revenue \\nrvices, revenues \\nwere up 3% this quarter, reflecting continued underlying momentum across both TTS and Securities \\nServices.  Net interest income was down 1%, largely driven by lower earnings on our net investment in \\nArgentina, partially offset by the benefi t of higher U.S. and Non -US interest rates relative to the prior -year \\nperiod. Non -interest revenue increased 11%, driven by continued strength across underlying fee drivers, as \\nwell as a smaller impact from currency devaluation in Argentina.  The underlying  growth in both businesses \\nis a result of our continued investments in product innovation, client experience and platform modernization \\nthat we highlighted during our Services Investor Day last month. Expenses increased 9%, largely driven by \\nan Argentina -related transaction tax expense, a legal settlement expense and continued investments in \\nproduct innovation and technology. Cost of credit was a benefit of $27 million, driven by an ACL release in \\nthe quarter. Average loans were up 3%, primarily driven by c ontinued demand for export and agency finance, \\nparticularly in Asia, as well as working capital loans to corporate and commercial clients in Latin America and \\nAsia.  Average deposits were down 1%, driven by non -operating deposit outflows. At the same time, we \\ncontinue to see good operating deposit inflows.  Net income was approximately $1.5 billion. And Services \\ncontinues to deliver a high RoTCE, coming in at 23.8% for the quarter.  \\nOn slide 14, we show the results for Markets for the second quarter. Markets r evenues were up 6%. Fixed \\nIncome revenues decreased 3%, driven by Rates and Currencies, which were down 11% on the back of lower \\nvolatility and tighter spreads.  This was partially offset by strength in Spread Products and Other Fixed \\nIncome, which was up 2 0% primarily driven by continued loan growth and higher securitization and \\nunderwriting fees.  In addition to a benefit from the Visa B exchange offer, we continued to see good \\nunderlying momentum in Equities, primarily driven by Equity Derivatives. And we continued to make \\nprogress in prime with balances up approximately 18%.  Expenses decreased 1%, driven by productivity \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Second  Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nJuly 12, 202 4 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   6 \\n savings, partially offset by higher volume -related expenses. Cost of credit was a benefit of $11 million, as an \\nACL release more than offs et net credit losses.  Average loans increased 11%, largely driven by asset -backed \\nlending in Spread Products. Average trading assets increased 12%, largely driven by client demand for \\nTreasuries and mortgage -backed securities.  Markets generated positive op erating leverage and delivered \\nnet income of approximately $1.4 billion with an RoTCE of 10.7% for the quarter.  \\nOn slide 15, we show the results for Banking for the second quarter.  Banking revenues increased 38%, driven \\nby growth in Investment banking and Corporate Lending. Investment Banking revenues increased 60%, \\ndriven by strength across Capital Markets and Advisory, given favorable market conditions.  DCM continued \\nto benefit from strong issuance activity, mainly in Investment Grade, as issuers continue d to de -risk funding \\nplans in advance of what could be a more volatile second half in the context of a number of important global \\nelections as well as the macro environment. In ECM, excluding China A -\\nactivity, led by th e US, as well as continued convertible issuance, as issuers take advantage of strong equity \\nmarket performance and expectations for rates to be higher for longer. And in Advisory, we are seeing \\nrevenues from the relatively low announced activity in 2023 co ming to fruition as those transactions close.  \\nBoth year -to-date and in the quarter, we gained share across DCM, ECM and Advisory, particularly in \\n Corporate Lending revenues, excluding mark -to-market on loan \\nhedges, in creased 7%, largely driven by higher revenue share. We generated positive operating leverage again \\nthis quarter as expenses decreased 10%, primarily driven by actions taken to right size the expense base.  \\nCost of credit was a benefit of $32 million, driven  by an ACL release reflecting an improvement in the \\nmacroeconomic outlook, partially offset by net credit losses. Average loans decreased 4% as we maintained \\nstrict discipline around returns combined with lower overall demand for credit.  Net income was $40 6 million \\nand RoTCE was 7.5% for the quarter.  \\nOn slide 16, we show the results for Wealth for the second quarter. Wealth revenues increased 2%, driven by \\na 13% increase in NIR from higher investment fee revenues, partially offset by a 4% decrease in NII fr om \\nhigher mortgage funding costs.  We continue to see good momentum in non -interest revenue as we \\nbenefited from double -digit client investment asset growth, both in North America and internationally, \\ndriven by net new client investment assets as well as ma rket valuations.  Expenses were down 4%, driven by \\nthe initial benefits of expense reductions as we right size the workforce and expense base. Cost of credit was \\na benefit of $9 million, as an ACL release more than offset net credit losses. Preliminary end -of-period client \\nbalances increased 9%, driven by higher client investment assets as well as higher deposits. Average loans \\nwere flat, as we continued to optimize capital usage.  Average deposits increased 2%, largely reflecting the \\ntransfer of relationship s and the associated deposits from USPB, partially offset by a shift in deposits to \\nhigher -\\n  Client investment assets were up 15%, driven by net new \\ninvestment asset flows and the benefit of higher market valuations. Wealth generated positive operating \\nleverage this quarter and delivered Net income of $210 million with an RoTCE of 6.4% for the quarter.  \\nOn slide 17, we show the results for US Personal Banking for the second quarter.  US Personal Banking \\nrevenues increased 6%, driven by NII growth of 5% and lower partner payments.  Branded Cards revenues \\nincreased 8%, driven by interest -earning balance growth of 9% as payment rates continue to moderate. And \\nwe continue to see growth in spend volumes up 3%, primarily  driven by customers with FICO scores of 740 \\nor higher.  Retail Services revenues increased 6%, primarily driven by lower payments from Citi to our partners \\ndue to higher net credit losses. And interest -earning balances grew 8%. Retail Banking revenues incr eased \\n3%, driven by higher deposit spreads, as well as mortgage and installment loan growth. USPB also generated \\npositive operating leverage this quarter, with expenses down 2%, driven by lower technology and \\ncompensation costs, partially offset by higher volume -related expenses.  Cost of credit increased to $2.3 \\nbillion, largely driven by higher NCLs of $1.9 billion and an ACL build of approximately $400 million reflecting \\nvolume growth in the quarter.  But let me remind you of the three things driving our N CLs this quarter . First, \\ncard loan vintages that were originated over the last few years are all maturing at the same time. These \\nvintages were delayed in their maturation due to the unprecedented levels of government stimulus during \\nthe pandemic. Second, we continue to see seasonally higher NCLs in the second quarter . Third, certain \\npockets of customers continue to be impacted by persistent inflation and high interest r ates resulting in \\nhigher losses. However, across both portfolios we are seeing signs of stabilization in delinquency \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Second  Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nJuly 12, 202 4 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   7 \\n performance, but we will continue to watch the impact of persistent inflation and high interest rates as the \\nyear progresses.  Despite these  factors we still expect Branded Cards to be in the 3.5% to 4.0% NCL range for \\nthe full year and Retail services to be at the high end of the range of 5.75% to 6.25%. Average deposits \\ndecreased 18%, as the transfer of relationships and the associated depos its to our Wealth business more \\nthan offset the underlying growth.  Net income was $121 million and RoTCE for the quarter was 1.9%.  \\nsaid before, we will continue to take actions to manage through regulatory headwinds, lap the credit cycle \\nand grow revenue while improving the overall operating efficiency of the business to ultimately get to a high -\\nteens return over the medium term.  \\nOn slide 18, we show results for All Other on a managed basis, which includes Corporate Other and Legacy \\nFranchises and excludes divestiture -related items.  Revenues decreased 22%, primarily driven by the closed \\nexits and wind -downs and higher funding costs, partially offset by growth in Mexico as well as the impact \\nfrom the Visa B exchange offer. And expenses decreased 7%, primarily driven by closed exits and wind -\\ndowns.  \\nSlide 19 shows our full year 2024 outlook and medium -term guidance, both of which remain unchanged. We \\ncontinue to remain laser focused on executing on our transformation and enhancing the businesses \\nperformance.  And while we recognize there is a lot more to do on Transformation, we are pleased with the \\nprogress we are making towards our 2024 and Medium -term targets and remain committed to these \\ntargets. With that, Jane and I will be happy t o take your questions.  \\n \\nQUESTION AND ANSWER  \\n \\nOPERATOR : Our first question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go \\nahead.  \\n \\nMIKE MAYO : Hi. Could you elaborate more on the amended consent order, Jane? You said it was \\ndisappointing to have gotten that this week. It\\'s almost four years into the consent order. And a little bit why \\nit hasn\\'t been resolved and what\\'s on , that\\'s the loss column and maybe a little bit more on the win column \\ntoo. I mean, you have what 12,000 p eople thrown at the problem. Billions of dollars. Is it not enough people? \\nIs it not enough money? Do you need to look at it in a different way? Are you not talking the same language?  \\n \\nI mean, you ha ve John Dugan as your lead independent director, ex head  of the OCC, and it seems like you \\ngot your report card. I guess you passed overall. They went out of their way to say some nice things, but it \\nlooks like you got failing grades in data and regulatory management. So, you\\'re confident it\\'s going to be \\nresolv ed, but it\\'s already been four years and it hasn\\'t been resolved. So what is it going to take from here and \\nhow can you resolve the regulatory concerns while continuing or serving shareholders better? And then in \\nthe win column, since it\\'s so nebulous this  back office, what are you achieving? You mentioned some items, \\nbut if you could put more meat on those bones. Thanks.  \\n \\nJANE FRASER:  Yes. Thank you, Mike. That\\'s a few different parts to that, so let\\'s start by just taking a step \\nback. Our transformation i s addressing decades of under -investment in large parts of Citi\\'s infrastructure \\nand in our risk and control environment. And when you unpack that , those areas where we had an absence \\nof enforced enterprise -wide standards and governance, we\\'ve had a siloed  organization that\\'s prevented \\nscale, a culture where a lot of groups were allowed to solve problem \\n  the same problem in different ways, \\nfragmented tech platforms, manual processes and controls, and a weak first line of defense, too few subject \\nmatter exp erts. So, this is a massive body of work that goes well beyond the consent order and this is not old \\nCiti putting in Band -Aids. This is Citi tackling the root issues head on. It\\'s a multiyear undertaking as we\\'ve \\ntalked about and you saw the statement by o ne of our regulators this week , we have made meaningful \\nprogress on our transformation and on our simplification.  \\n  \\nMark?  \\n \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Second  Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nJuly 12, 202 4 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   8 \\n MARK MASON: Yeah, and so as Jane says, the progress that we\\'ve made, it spans multiple parts of the \\nconsent order and transformation work. Remember, that consent order and transformation work includes \\nrisk, it includes controls, it includes compliance, it includes data and data related to the regulatory reporting, \\nand we\\'ve got evidence and proof points of progress against all of those things.  \\n \\nJANE FRASER: Thank you, Mark. So transforming, to answer your question about how do we fix it and serve \\nour investors at the same time. Transforming Citi will drive benefits for our shareholders, our clients, and our \\nregulators. This is not mutual ly exclusive. At the beginning of the year, we honed in on two priorities, the \\ntransformation and improving our business performance, and we\\'re able to do so because we\\'ve largely \\ncleared the decks. We have a clear focus strategy, we\\'ve executed the divest itures, we\\'ve got a much simpler \\norganization, so we can focus on these two priorities and we are able to do both.  \\n \\nYou can see that in our results again this quarter, multiple, solid proof points on the execution of the strategy \\nand we know what we need t o do on both fronts. We have plans in place on the transformation and on the \\nstrategy and we\\'re executing against them. We have been and we will be transparent when we have issues \\nand how we\\'re addressing them.  \\n \\nMARK MASON: And just to add a couple of data  points to that, Mike. You\\'ve heard us mention some of these \\nbefore, but we\\'ve retired platforms. We\\'ve reduced the number of data centers. Platforms are down some \\n300. We\\'ve moved from 39 corporate loan platforms down to south of 20. We\\'ve got 20 cash equ ities \\nexecution platforms down to 1; we\\'ve reduced the 6 reporting ledgers down to 1; 11 sanction s platforms down \\nto 1. So, we\\'ve been making considerable progress over the past couple of years.  \\n \\nWith that said, there\\'s a lot more work to be done around the data regulatory reporting work. If you think \\nabout Citi, we\\'ve got 11,000 global total reg reports, right. So, we\\'ve got to make sure that the data that\\'s \\ngoing into those reports is the quality of the data that we want it to be, but more import antly, that we\\'re doing \\nit efficiently, that it doesn\\'t take thousands of people to reconcile that information and so this is an end -to-\\nend process in the way we\\'re approaching it.  \\n \\nOne example is the 2052a liquidity report that we have. It has 750,000 lin es of data and that data is, it\\'s \\nimportant again that we\\'re efficiently collecting it from multiple systems with standards and governance that \\nensures it\\'s of the quality that we want it to be without again having to have manual activity supporting it.  \\n \\nOPERATOR: The next question  is from Glenn Schorr at Evercore. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.  \\n \\nGLENN SCHORR:  Hi. Thank you. So, Mark, I heard your comments on credit this year. I\\'m talking the US \\nPersonal Banking. I heard your comments for credit th e rest of this year and I think in a position that you\\'re  \\nvery conservatively reserved. But right now, you put up a 3% margin and credit costs are almost half of what \\nrevenues are in this space. I guess, my question is this: As we roll forward, in a slowin g economy with likely a \\nlittle bit lower \\n  some rate cuts, how does the P&L evolve? How does it improve from here? Because can we \\nbe expecting credit costs to come in, in a slowing economy? I\\'m just trying to figure out the path forward \\nbecause it could be  impactful if USPB obviously marches to where you need it to be.  \\n \\nMARK MASON : Yeah, look, like I said, we do think that there is certainly upside to USPB. We\\'re looking for \\nthat upside in the medium -term targets that we\\'ve set for ourselves. You\\'ve got to remember that when you \\nlook at the quarter and you look at the half, frankly, that we\\'re still in a period where we\\'re seeing the \\nnormalization of the cost of credit. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, you have kind of a \\ncompounding effect of mult iple vintages now maturing at the same time that\\'s playing through the P&L. \\nThat\\'s not just true for us , that\\'s true for others as well. And so we\\'d expect and we are \\n  we do believe we\\'re \\nseeing some signs of a cresting when you look at delinquencies now and so we would expect that those \\nlosses start to normalize and loss rates start to come down as we go towards the medium term.  \\n \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Second  Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nJuly 12, 202 4 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   9 \\n At the same time, we\\'re investing in the business and we\\'re looking to see continued growth in volume and \\non the top line. And the combination of those things, as we drive towards the medium term, will help us to \\ndeliver both the top line growth and certainly improve returns from where we sit today and in line with what \\nwe\\'ve guided to.  \\n \\nSo, it\\'s a combination of top line performa nce from volume and obviously the environment plays into that, \\nbut we feel like we\\'ve got a reasonable assumption around top line growth there, cost of credit normalizing, \\ncontinued discipline on the expense line, allowing for us to get improved returns ac ross that USPB business.  \\n \\nGLENN SCHORR : Okay. Appreciate all that. One quickie on DCM. You had amazingly good performance. \\nThere\\'s been plenty of conversation about pull forward this year on just refi driving like three -quarters of the \\nactivity. Could you just help us think through the second ha lf when thinking about DCM just to make sure \\nthat we don\\'t like start modelling this into perpetuity?  \\n \\nJANE FRASER: Look, I think when we think about the back half of 2024, we\\'re going to see a different mix of \\nactivity in Banking. We do still expect deman d to be quite strong across our capital market products because \\nyou\\'ve got a wall of maturing debt securities coming up in the second half that carry on for a couple of years. \\nBut, we did see some clients accelerating issuances into the first half getting ahead of potential market \\nvolatility. So, if you put it all together, I think we expect the rate environment and the financing markets to \\ncontinue to be accommodative as well as to continue deal making with M&A being a bit larger in the overall \\nmix, althou gh some of the regulatory elements have put a damper on part of that.  \\n \\nMARK MASON: Yeah. Only thing I\\'d add to that is, look, the wallet for the year is obviously going to depend \\non a couple thing s, so, one, the return of a more normalized IPO market , two,  the direction and volatility of \\ninterest rates , the ongoing global conflicts that we\\'re all kind of seeing and witnessing , and then finally, as \\nJane mentioned in her remarks, the elections and what those outcomes look like, not just in the US, but \\nabroad.  And so there are a number of  factors there that will play to the wallet. But as we said, we believe we\\'re \\nwell -positioned to be there to serve our clients and to do so in a way that makes good economic sense.  \\n \\nOPERATOR: The next question  is from Jim Mitch ell at Seaport Global. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.  \\n \\nJIM MITCHELL : Hey. Good morning. Just, Mark, maybe on NII, down almost 4% year -over -year. Seems a little \\nbit more than the guidance was down modestly for the year. So, can you discuss sort of the puts and takes \\nthis quarter and how we should think about the quarterly trajectory for the rest of the year?  \\n \\nMARK MASON: Yeah. So, I\\'d say a couple things. So, one, as I mentioned, in the quarter and you see it on \\nslide 9, ex -Markets, we\\'re down about 3%. That\\'s largely driven by some FX translation that played through, \\nbut also some seasonally lower revolving card balances and then lower interest rates in Argentina. And what \\nthat is in Argentina, we have capital there , the policy rate was ad justed downward and as that happened, we \\nobviously earned less on that capital that flows through the NII line.  \\n \\nAs I think about the back half of the year and the guidance we have of modestly down, there are a couple of \\nputs and takes to keep in mind. So,  one is going to be rates , right , so as I think about the higher yield that we \\ncan earn on reinvestment, that\\'ll be a tailwind that plays through from an NII point of view.  \\n \\nThe second would be volume growth, particularly in our card loans portfolio and we  do expect to see \\ncontinued volume growth across certainly the Branded portfolio and so that\\'ll be another tailwind for us on \\nthe NII line.  \\n \\nIn terms of the headwinds, you\\'ve got the lower NII earned in Argentina from rates , that\\'ll continue to play \\nthroug h. We\\'ve got assumed higher average betas in 2024, specifically on the non -US side. We still have in \\nour forecast the impact of CFPB late fees , so assuming that that goes into effect for this year, that will have \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Second  Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nJuly 12, 202 4 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   10 \\n an impact and it\\'s in the forecast, and the n the impact of lost NII from the exits that we have. And so, the \\ncombination of those things will probably mean that NII in the back half of the year is a little bit higher than \\nthe first half, but again, consistent with the guidance that we gave of modes tly down.  \\n \\nJIM MITCHELL: That\\'s helpful. And maybe just quickly, kind of a similar question on expenses. Better -than -\\nexpected this quarter, but there was no restructuring or repositioning charges. I think to get to the high end \\nof your range, you\\'d have to  be up a little bit in the back half from 2Q run rate. Is that because you expect \\nmore repositioning, restructuring in the second half or maybe just talk through expense trajectory from here?  \\n \\nMARK MASON: Yeah, so that\\'s right. When I talk about it  at the first quarter, I talked about kind of a \\ndownward trend for each of the quarters after Q1. The second quarter came in a bit lower than we were \\nexpecting. I\\'m sticking with the guidance and it does mean that the back half of the year will likely come in \\n  \\nwill come in higher than the second quarter. That\\'s a combination of a couple of things, including the pace of \\nhiring and investment that we will do in the transformation work that has to be done. It also includes \\nrepositioning charges that we might take or need to take  as we continue to work through our businesses \\nacross the firm and the franchise and then the second quarter did or \\n  yeah, the second quarter did have a \\none -time or so and some delayed spending that will pick up in the third and fourth quarter  around \\nadvertising and marketing and some of the other line items. So, yes,  the third and fourth quarter, the back \\nhalf will be higher than the second quarter, but consistent with the guidance that I\\'ve given.  \\n \\nOPERATOR:  The next question  is from Erika Na jarian at UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.  \\n \\nERIKA NAJARIAN : Hi. I had two questions and I\\'ll ask the first one on expenses first since it\\'s a good follow -\\nup to the previous. Mark, just to clarify. Let\\'s just say, take the highest end of your range at $53.8 billion. Just \\ntrying to think about how consensus will move. So, we take that $53.8 billion and then add the $285 million \\nof FDIC expenses year -to-date so far and add the civil money penalties of $136 million, so that gets us to \\n$54.2 b illion for the year and any other repositioning charges in the second half of the year would already be \\nincluded in the $53.8 billion?  \\n \\nMARK MASON:  So, yes. The answer to the last part of your question is yes. So in the range that I\\'ve given, \\n$53.5 billion  to $53.8 billion, that includes our estimate for the full year of repositioning and any \\nrestructuring charges. That range excludes the FDIC Special Assessment that we saw earlier in the year and \\nit excludes the CMP of $136 million.  \\n \\nERIKA NAJARIAN: Got it . And my second question is for Jane and I\\'m sure you\\'re getting tired of the question \\non capital return. So, you\\'re buying back $1 billion , you plan to buy back $1 billion this quarter. It looks like \\nyou didn\\'t buy back any in the second quarter. And I\\'m asking this question in this context because \\nconsensus has a buyback of nearly $1 billion in the fourth quarter and staying at this rate for the first half of \\nnext year and ramping higher. And I guess, is the $1 billion number a catch -up pace because you d idn\\'t buy \\nback any in the second quarter? And I fully appreciate that you also have the Banamex IPO coming, which is \\ndifferent from peers that are also waiting for Basel clarification. But I\\'m just wondering, do we need to wait \\nfor that Banamex IPO for the  company to feel comfortable moving away from that quarter -to-quarter \\nguidance? And also, of course, I just want to readdress the beginning of the question when I asked \\nspecifically about the pace.  \\n \\nJANE FRASER:  Okay. So, we are not going to be giving guid ance going forward around our buybacks. We are \\ngoing to continue to give quarterly and make it a quarterly determination as to the level. And a lot of that is \\nto do with the uncertainty about the forthcoming regulatory changes. I think we were delighted to  see a slight \\nreduction in our Stress Capital Buffer, reflecting the financial strength and resiliency of our business model \\nand also good to see the benefits of our strategy playing out. But with the regulatory changes uncertain, \\nthat\\'s one of the major f actors for us to continue with the quarterly guidance.  \\n \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Second  Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nJuly 12, 202 4 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   11 \\n MARK MASON:  Yeah, that\\'s right. And on the first part of your question, Erika, I\\'d say, look, we were in \\ndiscussions with our regulators and we made a prudent call as it relates to buybacks in the qua rter for Q2. \\nSo, Q3, as we talked about, would be at $1 billion and that should not be necessarily viewed as a run rate \\nlevel. As Jane mentioned, we\\'ll take it quarter by quarter from here.  \\n \\nOPERATOR: The next question  is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC . Your line is now open. Please go ahead.  \\n \\nGERARD CASSIDY : Thank you, Hi Jane, Hi Mark. Mark, regarding the comments you made about the higher \\ncredit losses, the three factors that you gave us, can you also talk about, if this was a factor at all for you \\nfolks, was there any FICO score inflation back during the pandemic that might be playing into these kind of \\ncredit losses? And as part of the credit card question, you mentioned the CFPB, the fees that you have \\nfactored in, the lower fees \\n  you factore d that into your forward -look. Where do we stand on that? Do you \\nguys have any color on that as well?  \\n \\nMARK MASON: Yeah, so, on the first part of the question, look, we all kind of have talked about in the past, \\nthe prospect of FICO inflation back during t he COVID period of time. We\\'ve been very focused on ensuring \\nthat acquisitions that we\\'ve made have been appropriately kind of analyzed in the underwriting of that to get \\ncomfortable with the quality of new customers that we\\'ve been bringing on. In light o f the environment, we \\nhave looked at moving towards higher FICO scores for new account acquisitions. But as I think about what \\nwe\\'re seeing now, there is that dichotomy that I mentioned where we have the higher FICO score customers \\nthat are driving the spe nd growth and that frankly have still continued strong balances and savings and it\\'s \\nreally the lower FICO band customers, where we\\'re seeing the sharper drop  in payment rates and more \\nborrowing. And so, the FICO inflation has effectively kind of fizzled o ut when we look at the mix and dynamic \\nof the customer portfolio that we have at this point.  \\n \\nAnd i n terms of the CFPB late fees, well, I don\\'t have an update on that. Like I said, we\\'ve built in an \\nassumption in our forecast. But in terms of the timing, I  don\\'t have a formal update on the certainty of it.  \\n \\nOPERATOR:  The next question  is from Ken Usdin at Jefferies. Your line is  now  open. Please go ahead.  \\n \\nKEN USDIN : Hey , thanks , good morning. Hey, Mark. Talking about the NII outlook and the fact that now \\nwe\\'ve got a little bit of a discrepancy starting between US rates, maybe higher for longer , and then the \\nbeginnings of some of the non -US curve starting to, at least put fourth their first cut. I know we\\'ve got that \\ngood chart that you have in the Qs about the relative contributions. Can you just help us understand a little \\nbit of like just generally how you\\'re thinking  through that discrepancy and how that informs the difference \\nbetween US -related NII and non -US-related NII as you go forward?  \\n \\nMARK MASON : Yeah, thank you. So look, I think that as we look at it, out through the \\n  certainly through the \\nmedium term, we expect to see continued NII growth at obviously a modest level, certainly lower than what \\nwe\\'ve seen historically and that\\'s in large part becau se or in part I should say because of how we\\'ve been \\nmanaging the balance sheet and that has allowed for us to reinvest as securities have rolled off and earn a \\nhigher yield on them relative to what we were earning, in some instances, they were five -year t erms on some \\nof these investments. And so we still think there\\'s some upside from a reinvestment point of view.  \\n \\nThe point you make around kind of non -US dollar or US rates kind of coming off, that\\'ll play through a little \\nbit as we think about the beta in creases that we\\'re expecting outside of the US. And so, we\\'ve assumed that \\nwe have higher betas pick up outside of the US. If rates kind of come off in a more substantive way, then we \\ncould see kind of a little less NII pressure than we\\'re forecasting ther e. But net -net, as I think about the \\ncombination of volume growth that we\\'re expecting between loans and deposits over that medium term, the \\nhigher yield we can earn on our assets, combined with the pricing capabilities that we have across the \\nportfolio, o ffsetting some of that beta, we believe we\\'ll have continued NII growth.  \\n \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Second  Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nJuly 12, 202 4 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   12 \\n As I think about what I often point to in terms of the IRE analysis and you have to  remember that that is a \\nshock to the current balance sheet and it assumes that the full curve is moving simultaneously, cross \\ncurrencies. And in that case, the 100 basis point parallel shift downward would be a negative $1.6 billion, \\nwith about $1.3 billi on coming from non -US dollar. But again, that does assume that all of those currencies \\ncome down at the same time and doesn\\'t account for the rebalancing of the balance sheet and things that I \\nmentioned like the reinvestment higher yields that we\\'d be able  to earn.  \\n \\nKEN USDIN : Got it. Okay. And just one follow -up on the OCC amendment and that\\'s specifically related to \\nthe Resource Review Plan. Do you have a line of sight on how long that\\'ll take you guys to finish because it \\nseems like \\n  and is that what we  should be thinking about in terms of just understanding like what the side \\nof what you need to get done in terms of the other language that\\'s written in the order?  \\n \\nJANE FRASER : So, Ken, look, the Resource Review Plan is just that. It\\'s a plan to ensure t hat we have \\nsufficient resources allocated towards achieving a timely and sustainable compliance to the order. \\nEssentially if an area is delayed or looking as if it could be, we\\'ll determine what additional resourcing, if any, \\nis required to get back on tr ack and then we\\'ll share that with the OCC in a more formalized way than we do \\ntoday and we obviously review this pretty constantly ourselves.  \\n \\nWe\\'re already working on the plan. After it\\'s finalized with the OCC it will be confidential supervisory \\ninforma tion that we can\\'t disclose. So, we won\\'t be able to tell you that the plan is , what the nature of the \\nplan is going to be, but it won\\'t be much more complicated than what we talked about. And we\\'re expecting \\nto get it , we\\'re not expecting this to take lon g. \\n \\nOPERATOR:  The next question  is from Betsy Graseck with  Morgan Stanley . Your line is now open. Please go \\nahead.  \\n \\nBETSY GRASECK : Hi good  afternoon. So, I know we talked a lot about expenses. I just have one kind of \\noverarching question here, which is on how we should think about the path of expenses between now and \\nthe medium term, as we have come quite a long way in the simplification process. Maybe if you could give us \\na sense as to how far along simplification impact on expenses we are? And overlapping with the regulatory \\nrequirements, do these net out or are we skewed a little bit more towards regulatory requirements  being a \\nbit heavier than what\\'s  left on simplification from here?  Thanks.  \\n \\nMARK MASON:  So, thank you, Betsy. I guess I\\'d say a couple things. So, I think we said it in the past. So, the \\ntarget for the medium term, we think 2026 is somewhere around $51 billion to $53 billion of expenses.  As \\nwe\\'ve said, we\\'ll have about $1.5 billion in savings related to the restructuring that we\\'ve done and another \\n$500 million to $1 billion related to net expense reductions from eliminating the stranded costs as well as \\nadditional productivity over that medium -term period. And so, we\\'ve made, I think, very good headway, as \\nJane has mentioned, in the org simplification and the restructuring charges associated with that. Those \\nsaves will have started to generate. Some of those saves in the early part of tha t, meaning this year, will likely \\nbe offset by continued investment that we\\'re making in areas of the business like transformation, but also in \\nbusiness -led or driven growth. And you should expect in terms of the trend that we would have a downward \\ntrend t owards 2026 in achieving that range.  \\n \\nJANE FRASER : And I just want to reiterate, we remain confident that we will meet our 11% to 12% RoTCE \\ntarget over the medium term. And we\\'ve got the , we have the ability to manage the different elements we\\'ve \\nbeen talk ing about today, making sure that we\\'re investing sufficient resources into the transformation so \\nwe can be on track with that, as well as in our businesses, as well as the return of capital to our shareholders. \\nSo, we feel confident around that and good a bout it, we can manage this.  \\n \\nMARK MASON:  Yeah, I think that\\'s a great point, Jane. Look, the reality is, as was pointed out earlier, we \\nspent about $3 billion last year, a little bit under that, on the transformation -related work. And the plan has \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Second  Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nJuly 12, 202 4 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   13 \\n called for us to spend a little bit more than that this year. And frankly, in the first half of the year, as we work \\nthrough the transformation work and some of the things that Jane and I have mentioned earlier in the year \\nthat we\\'ve been focused on, like data an d data related to regulatory reporting, we\\'ve had to spend more than \\nwe had planned for in the first half, right, and we\\'ve done that and we funded that.  \\n \\nWe\\'ve been able to find productivity opportunities that allow for us to still stay within the guidanc e that we\\'ve \\ngiven for the full year. So, we are managing this entire expense base, right, so not \\n  the whole $53 billion plus \\nof it, we are actively managing that with an eye towards what\\'s required from a transformation point of view \\nto keep it on track,  to accelerate in areas where we\\'re behind and to shore up areas where we\\'re tracking in \\naccordance to what the order requires and where are the other inefficiencies that can allow for us to free up \\nthe expense base? And so, things like the work that Andy Sieg has done with the finance team around that \\nexpense base and finding efficiencies there are opportunities that we\\'ve been able to tease out of the \\nbusiness. Things that we have done in parts of USPB and that we have continued to get after in parts of \\nBanking, which you see in the down 10% this quarter are areas where we\\'ve been keenly focused on, where \\nare there duplicative roles, where are there inefficient processes that we can actually drive greater efficiency \\nout of. So, longwinded way of saying, we  understand the expense guidance that we\\'ve given, we also \\nunderstand and stress the importance of funding the transformation with what\\'s required and we\\'re doing \\nboth.  \\n \\nBETSY GRASECK: Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Appreciate that.  \\n \\nOPERATOR:  The next question  is from Vivek Juneja with  JPMorgan. Your line is  now  open. Please go ahead.  \\n \\nVIVEK JUNEJA : Hi. Let me just clarify this, Mark and Jane, just to make sure that we all have it right. The $53.5 \\nbillion to $53.8 billion does not include anything thus far on what you think you may need to spend on the \\nResource Review Plan, meaning what additional resources you would have to put to fix the consent order. \\nAm I right there?  \\n \\nJANE FRASER : No, you\\'re not right. So, I think as you\\'ve heard us talk about,  Vivek, for a while now, that we \\nknew the areas that we were behind in elements of our transformation program and that we began \\naddressing those and making the investments. Some of that\\'s in people. Some of that is in technology spend. \\nIt\\'s using different  tools and capabilities to get areas addressed earlier and we began that earlier in the year \\nand you saw that acknowledged as well by our regulators who pointed to the fact that we\\'ve already begun \\naddressing the areas that we\\'re behind.  \\n \\nMark?  \\n \\nMARK MASON : That\\'s right, Jane, and what you have heard is that despite having to spend more, some $250 \\nmillion or so more, we\\'re not changing the guidance, right. And so, we have, as Jane mentioned, we have \\nworked on areas already that we\\'ve needed to and we h ave looked for ways to absorb that and are doing so \\nwithin our guidance.  \\n \\nVIVEK JUNEJA: Okay. So, going forward, even though this plan is still to be sort of put together and approved \\nby the regulators, we should not expect any change to this expense  guidance ? \\n \\nMARK MASON:  Look, the plan, the Resource Review Plan, as Jane mentioned, is what we\\'re working through \\nnow with the regulators. That will be a process for demonstrating to them that we are spending and \\nallocating the appropriate resource s to accomplishing the commitments that we have. Appropriate \\nresources can range from people to technology to enhancing our processes and ensuring better execution.  \\n \\nIf you think about what that will entail, it will entail areas where we are delayed or beh ind as we identify those \\nareas, being able to tease out the root cause of any delay and ensure that we\\'ve got proper funding allocated \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Second  Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nJuly 12, 202 4 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   14 \\n to get it back on track and that\\'s me framing out how I think about what something like this might look like. \\nAnd so, wha t we\\'re saying is that if we identify issues in the quarters to come, that we haven\\'t identified \\nalready, that\\'s the process we\\'re going to apply to those issues. And as you\\'ve heard us say repeatedly, we\\'re \\ngoing to spend whatever is necessary to then get  those things back on track. And as we\\'ve done thus far this \\nyear, we\\'re going to look for opportunities to absorb those headwinds. I hope that\\'s clear.  \\n \\nOPERATOR:  The next question  is from Matt O\\'Connor with  Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go \\nahead.  \\n \\n: Hi. Apologies if I missed it in the opening remarks, but what drove the decline in credit \\ncard revenues from 1Q to 2Q? Looks like they were down about 6% in aggregate even though avera ge loans \\nwent up, spending went up. What was the driver of that?  \\n \\nMARK MASON : Credit card revenues, seasonality.  \\n \\nJANE FRASER : Yeah, seasonality.  \\n \\nMARK MASON:  Seasonality playing through there  sequentially. Yeah.  \\n \\nJANE FRASER:  I think if you look year -over -year, you\\'ll be able to see a pretty common trend there. The \\nconsumer is slowing in some of the , in the spend, as Mark had referred to, Matt. And a lot of the spending \\nand the growth areas we are seeing and underlying numbers is being driven by the affluent customer.  \\n \\nMARK MASON:  Yeah. I think there\\'s also the dynamic on the CRS of the reward or across the portfolio of \\nrewards playing through from one quarter to the other, so the combination of those things are playing \\nthrough the revenue line there.  \\n \\nJANE FRASER:  But nothing that\\'s particularly worrying us, Matt.  \\n \\n: Okay. And then just separately on the very early kind of part of the prepared remarks, you \\ntalked about the dividends being capped in terms of what cou ld be upstream from the bank to the holding \\ncompany because of the OCC that came out this week. For all intents and purposes, like does that impact \\nhow you run the company or subsidiary or impact liquidity or capital? I understood the comment, no change \\nto dividends or buybacks at the holding company, but is there any impact from that that we would notice on \\nthe outside? Thank you.  \\n \\nJANE FRASER:  Look, let\\'s be clear, this action does not impact our ability to return capital to our \\nshareholders. The dividends that are referenced are just intercompany payments from CBNA to the parent. \\nSo, first of all, don\\'t confuse what a dividend is here. We will , it\\'s not going to impact how we run the company, \\nthe subsidiary, the capital, the liquidity at all and the dividends are not capped.  \\n \\nMARK MASON:  Yeah, I think, Jane, that\\'s right. And I think let\\'s not lose sight of the purpose of the orders \\nthat are the re and the purpose of the orders that are there are to ensure that we\\'re funding and allocating the \\neffort appropriately, right.  \\n \\nSo, the regulators want essentially the same thing we want, right, is for us to get this done, right, and so that \\nis the prima ry objective. The reference to the dividending from out of CBNA up to the parent is certainly \\nreferenced there between now and establishing that Resource Review Plan. But as Jane mentions, that does \\nnot constrain  the parent from doing the things that it wi ll need to do. And as opposed to, it\\'s not a cap. What \\nit is, is that anything above the debt service of the parent or the preferred dividends and other \\nnondiscretionary obligations would require a non -objection from the OCC.  \\n \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Second  Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nJuly 12, 202 4 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   15 \\n JANE FRASER:  Until the Resour ce Plan is agreed  and as you\\'ll have seen, the Resource Plan needs to be \\nsubmitted within 30 days, and as I indicated, we\\'re working on that one and not anticipating that to be a \\nproblem.  \\n \\nOPERATOR:  The next question  is from Saul Martinez with HSBC. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.  \\n \\nSAUL MARTINEZ : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just, I guess I just want to follow up \\non the latter question. I just want to be very clear. So, what you\\'re saying  is that the requirement that CBNA \\nreceive a non -objection before dividending upstream to the parent, that does not impact how you think \\nabout your capital flexibility, how you think about \\n  it doesn\\'t restrict you in any way and shouldn\\'t impact, \\nfor exam ple, your ability to benefit from, for example, a Basel Endgame rule that is softened or some of the \\nbenefits, Mark, that you talked about in terms of simplification. So, you don\\'t see this impacting your ongoing \\nlevel of capital flexibility and your abili ty to repurchase stock going forward if some of these things actually \\ndo play out?  \\n \\nMARK MASON: No.  \\n \\nSAUL MARTINEZ:  You don\\'t? Right. Okay.  \\n \\nMARK MASON: No, I don\\'t. Right.  \\n \\nSAUL MARTINEZ:  Fair enough. That was as clear as can be.  \\n \\nMARK MASON: Thank you.  \\n \\nSAUL MARTINEZ:  Second question on, I just want to follow up on USPB. I still \\n  I get the point that you\\'re \\nseeing a normalization in losses in Cards. But even if I adjust for reserve builds, your RoTCE is still single \\ndigits. I would think even at th ese NCL levels, your Cards business is pretty profitable. You\\'re a scale player, \\nyou\\'re above sort of pre -pandemic levels, but not \\n  I don\\'t know if I, it doesn\\'t seem like it\\'s that much higher \\nby a dramatic amount. It would seem to imply that the Retail Bank is a huge drag on profitability, even \\n  \\nmaybe even losing money, I don\\'t know. But can you just talk about what you can do to sort of improve the \\nRetail Bank profitability and just give anymore color that you can in terms of the path to get to that hi gh-teen \\nRoTCE you talked about?  \\n \\nJANE FRASER : Yeah, let me kick off there, and let\\'s say, look, clearly, we\\'re very focused on improving the \\nreturns in USPB to get us to the high -teens level over the medium term and you\\'ve seen us generating healthy \\npositi ve operating leverage this quarter. We\\'ve had a number of quarters of good revenue growth. And as \\nMark said, we\\'re at the low point of the credit cycle and we knew this year, we would see the pressure on \\nreturns from the elevated NCLs and some of the indus try headwinds we\\'ve talked about. But as the NCL rates \\napproach steady state levels and the mitigating actions that all of us have been putting in place against the \\nindustry headwinds, as those take hold, we expect the returns will improve and support the firm -wide \\nmedium -term targets.  \\n \\nIn the Retail Bank, we\\'re continuing to focus on growing share in our six core markets and we\\'re doing that, \\nleveraging our physical and digital assets. It plays an important role in enabling the wealth continuum and \\nthe growth that we\\'re looking at in our Wealth franchise. We\\'re continuing to improve our operating \\nefficiency, b eing very disciplined in expense management and managing carefully the branch and digital \\nproductivity of the Retail Bank network. But we\\'re at the high point of the credit cycle. It\\'s driving the low \\npoint for USPB, and as I said in my remarks, we\\'re expe cting to see those returns improve from here.  \\n \\nOPERATOR:  The next question  is from Steven Chubak with  Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Please go \\nahead.  \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Second  Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nJuly 12, 202 4 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   16 \\n  \\nSTEVEN CHUBAK: Hi. Good afternoon. So, Mark, I have a fairly technical question on DTA utilizatio n and \\nspecifically the NOLs. The deduction is still fairly significant at $12 billion. It roughly equates to about 10% of \\nyour market cap. And the good news here, I suppose, is that it should come back into capital over time, but \\nwe\\'ve seen very little uti lization over the past two years despite the firm being profitable. And so wanted to \\nbetter understand this, what\\'s constraining your ability to utilize those DTAs and are there catalysts on the \\nhorizon that could help accelerate that utilization beyond or ganic earnings generation?  \\n \\nMARK MASON:  Yes. Thank you. So, I\\'m going to give you a very simple answer to a very complicated question. \\nIt really comes down to driving US income, right. And so, we are focused on not just all of the things that \\nwe\\'ve mention ed, but driving higher income in the US. That allows for us to utilize the disallowed DTA. We \\nsaw some of that in the quarter and we expect to see more of it as we move through the medium term, but \\nthat is the major driver of that utilization.  \\n \\nJANE FRASER : And we have many of our business heads very much focused around that opportunity as well. \\nSo, winning in the US is a very important leg, for example, of the strategy that Vis is refreshing. Similarly, we \\nsee opportunities from the Commercial Bank. We see  it in Wealth. We see it in, obviously in US Personal \\nBanking and in Services. So, we\\'re very , we\\'re focused from a business strategy point of view on this, not just \\nfrom the financial side.  \\n \\nSTEVEN CHUBAK: Thank you, both, for that color. Maybe just a quick follow -up just on the Retail Services \\nbusiness. We are seeing some evidence that your competitors in this space have been more aggressive \\nleading with price in an effort to win some new mandates. And was hoping you could just speak to what \\nyou\\'re seeing across the competitor set and your appetite or willingness to potentially offer better economics \\nin response to increased competition from some of your peers.  \\n \\nJANE FRASER : I think you\\'ll be delighted to he ar that we\\'re very focused on returns rather than just on \\nrevenues. So, when we enter into discussions with a partner who may be a new RFP  for their portfolio or \\nlooking at new ones such as the one we just agreed with Dillard\\'s, it\\'s all about the returns and the profile of \\nthe business rather than the revenue side of things. And it\\'s a shift probably from some other ways in the \\npast, but I\\'m very pleased with how disciplined the team is being around this and we\\'re seeing the benefits \\nof it.  \\n \\nMARK MASON : Yeah. And that may be different from what you hear and see from other players in the space. \\nBut as Jane mentioned, we\\'re keenly focused on ensuring that, yes, we have a good partnership, but that \\nwe\\'re generating an appropriate return. That\\'s part of achievi ng our medium -term targets. And as you know, \\nsince you brought up Retail cards, I mean, when we think about how CECL works and the reserves you have \\nto establish for these partnerships, we\\'re establishing full, lifetime reserves that\\'s on the balance sheet  where \\nultimately we end up splitting those through the partner sharing economics. So, it\\'s another important \\nconsideration as we think about expanding and taking on these relationships and renegotiating \\npartnerships to making sure that returns make good s ense for us.  \\n \\nJANE FRASER : Yeah. And Mark and I have no problem saying no to revenue that doesn\\'t come at the right \\nreturn s and being very disciplined around that.  \\n \\nOPERATOR:  The next question  is from Vivek Juneja with  JPMorgan . Your line is now open. Plea se go ahead.  \\n \\nVIVEK JUNEJA : Hi. Sorry, just to follow up on this whole consent order stuff, Jane. What do you think this \\ndoes in terms of timing, how much longer for you to sort of get this past you? Are you talking couple of years? \\nIs it now longer by a year? Any sense of that? Any sense of helping us think through that?  \\n \\nJANE FRASER:  Look, in terms of the consent order and the areas we\\'ve had delays, there are four areas to the \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Second  Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nJuly 12, 202 4 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   17 \\n consent order. It\\'s risk management, it\\'s data governance, it\\'s around compli ance and it\\'s around control. As \\nwe\\'ve said, we were falling behind in certain areas related to data and we\\'ve been investing to address the \\nareas that we were behind. We also saw an increase in the scope related to regulatory reporting, so we added \\nsome m ore bodies of work there and we\\'re well underway. So, we are not expecting this to extend the original \\nexpectations that we have on when we will complete the body of work for the consent order.  \\n \\nWe have a target state for the different areas of it. We have the plan to achieve those target states. We\\'ll make \\nthe investments necessary to ensure that we do so. We\\'ll try and get this done as quickly, but as robustly as \\npossible and we\\'re doing this by making strategic fixes and investments rather than, what  I would call, the \\nold Citi way, which is a series of Band -Aids that remediate, but don\\'t actually fix the underlying issue and \\nthat way, we are delivering for our shareholders as well as our regulators and our clients because we\\'re \\nputting in strategic so lutions that will benefit all, but I\\'m not expecting this to change the timeframes.  \\n \\nVIVEK JUNEJA : Thank you.  \\n \\nOPERATOR:  The final question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo . Your line is now open. \\nPlease go ahead.  \\n \\nMIKE MAYO : Hi. Just two clarifications. So, this is a very high -profile  amendment to the consent order. And \\nI think what I hear you saying that if you can confirm, your risk compliance and controls are getting passing \\ngrade. It\\'s really the data and as it relates to the data, you \\'re talking about 11,000 regulatory reports, some \\nwhich had 750,000 lines of data. Is that really the scope of what you need to fix? Because people see this \\nexternally and say, hey, you\\'re failing in terms of overall controls and resiliency. But I think I hear you saying \\nit\\'s really more about just the data and the regulatory reporting, which is important, but more of a slice of a \\nbroader picture. Is that correct?  \\n \\nJANE FRASER : Yeah, Mike, maybe I just \\n  maybe I \\n  you\\'re asking a great and it\\'s an important  question, so \\nmaybe I try and explain what the data elements because it\\'s an area that Mark and I have pointed to. So, first \\nof all, we use data all over the firm. We use it to deliver 72 million customer statements every month. Our \\ncorporate clients, as y ou heard about at our Service s Investor Day, access account data real -time across \\nmultiple countries on CitiDirect. And we\\'re moving $5 trillion roughly per day for those clients around the \\nworld. We trade billions of dollars in a millisecond on our tradin g platforms. We can see our liquidity positions \\nreal -time around the world. This can only be done if you\\'ve got pretty pristine data and highly automated \\necosystems.  \\n \\nSo, but what is the transformation doing? What it is doing is simplifying how data moves through the firm \\nand it\\'s about upgrading the management and governance over those flows. And as I\\'ve said, we\\'re doing a \\nstrategic overhaul of large parts of our infrastructure, so what are we doing?  \\n \\nWe\\'re making sure we\\'re capturing data accuratel y using smart tools and automation. We\\'ll often talk about \\nthis smart system , makes sure there\\'s no errors when we book a trade. We\\'ve seen our error rate down 85% \\nas a result of it. We\\'re housing our upstream data in two standardized repositories , they\\'re  the golden \\nsources, an in -person data hub which you\\'ve heard me talk about a few times and they\\'re a golden source \\nnow for all of the downstream data use, populating the thousands of regulatory reports Mark talked about \\nand other areas. And what a single repository means is that the data models, the data quality rules, the \\ncontrols you put in place that govern and manage that data, they all sit in one place rather than being \\ndistributed all over the firm as they have been historically.  \\n \\nMark\\'s been investi ng in building a standardized reporting infrastructure. You\\'ve heard us talk about a single \\nfull suite reporting ledger versus the six or so reporting ledgers that we had in the past. And we\\'re delivering \\nall of this through consolidated systems, through t he automation and streamlining of data flows, so instead \\nof being in multiple pipes, the flows go through single pipes. So, it\\'s a , sorry to get a bit plumber on you for a \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Second  Quarter  202 4 Earnings  Call  \\nJuly 12, 202 4 \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   18 \\n moment, but I think it is important to understand what it is because it\\'s a lot of w ork. It\\'s a strategic overhaul. \\nIt\\'s not a series of tactical fixes.  \\n \\nWhere we\\'re behind, as we do the work on data, we identify specific issues we need to fix as we execute the \\nplan that we have in place. There\\'s some more areas to address than we knew ba ck when we did the plan and \\nwe\\'ve also accelerated the work on improving the accuracy of our regulatory reports and we increased the \\nscope of this work as well. It\\'s more comprehensive than originally planned.  \\n \\nSo, what we\\'re doing, we\\'re adding resources and data experts. We\\'re learning from best practices and we\\'re \\nusing some great AI and other data tools that are helping to identify anomalies in data and data flows much \\nmore quickly. We\\'re also, to some of the culture side, we\\'re learning from pilots how  do we accelerate broader \\ndeployment at scale across the firm in a consistent enterprise -wide manner. So, all of these things in the \\ndata side are going to enable us to leapfrog competitors, more revenue opportunities, better client service, \\nfewer buffers,  drive more efficiencies and hope at the end \\n  the end goal here is it becomes a competitive \\nadvantage for the firm. That is the data plan.  \\n \\nClearly, there\\'s a very important element of it related to the consent orders. We\\'re behind in a few areas. We\\'re \\ninvesting. We\\'ve already begun that investment, as Mark and I\\'ve talked about, to get it done. We\\'ll get it \\ndone.  \\n \\nMIKE MAYO: Yeah, just to say real short follow -up to that. So you\\'re doing all this great stuff, but you still fell \\nshort, just in like one se ntence, despite doing all of this great stuff that you described, the regulator still said \\nyou didn\\'t get it done. Why, after doing all that, didn\\'t you get it done in the eyes of the regulators and why \\nwill it be fixed now? Just like a one sentence explan ation for that if you have it.  \\n \\nJANE FRASER: I always said that a transformation of this magnitude over multiple years would not be linear. \\nWe have many steps forward. We have setbacks. We adjust, we learn from them, we move forward and we \\nget back on track.  \\n \\nMARK MASON: And Mike, if I could just put  one number into context because you played back the 11,000, \\nwhich was a number of global regulatory reports across the landscape here.

Good afternoon  and thank you all for joining our Fourth Quarter \\n2023 Earnings Call . I am joined today by our Chief Executive Office, Jane Fraser, and our Chief Financial \\nOfficer, Mark Mason.

I hope you all had a good break.  \\nAt Citi, we are back at it.  Given the notable items, and our new financial reporting structure, we have a lot \\nto cover today so I\\n right to it.  \\n \\n2023 was a foundational year in which we made substantial progress simplifying Citi and executing t he \\nstrategy we laid out at Investor Day.  With that said the fourth quarter was clearly very disappointing.   Today \\nI will provide a high -level view on our progress in 2023, discuss our Q4 results, and finish with our priorities \\nfor 2024.  We know 2024 is critical as we prepare to enter the next phase of our journey and we are \\ncompletely focused on delivering our medium -term targets and our transformation.   \\n \\nSo, turning to what we accomplished in terms of executing our strategy.  As you can see on slide 5, i n 2023, \\nwe saw a record year for Services, where we maintained our #1 ranking among large institutions in TTS with \\nclient wins up 27% and a sustained win/loss rate above 80%.  We have now gained over 100bps in share in \\nSecurities Services since 2021. In We alth, we added an estimated $21 billion in net new assets during the \\nyear. In USPB we enjoyed our sixth consecutive quarter of growth, and we began to see the early fruits of \\nour investments in key talent in Banking.    \\n \\nIn September, we began the most con sequential series of changes to the organization and the running of \\nour firm since the aftermath of the financial crisis.  We restructured around five core, interconnected \\nbusinesses to align our organization to our business strategy and to provide greater  transparency into their \\nperformance.   You now can see in our financials the full -year returns and P&L by business.  While they are \\nall impacted by investments and Transformation expense, it is clear where we have work to do.  The \\nsimplification of our org anization structure will conclude at the end of Q1 and will result in over $1 billion of \\nrun -rate saves from the net elimination of approximately five thousand roles, mainly managers.  As Mark \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Fourth  Quarter  202 3 Earnings  Call  \\nJanuary 12, 202 4 \\n \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   2 \\n will detail, this will contribute to the reduction of our expens\\nsimplification, benefits of the Transformation, stranded costs and other productivity efforts, we expect to \\neliminate 20 thousand positions ex -Mexico, resulting in over $2 billion in run -rate saves.   \\n \\nSimplificatio n is also enabling Citi to be more client focused and less bureaucratic.  Realizing the synergies \\nbetween our five businesses is one of the key drivers to achieving our medium -term revenue targets. With \\nthis new structure, I am holding my business leaders accountable for enhancing connectivity across clients \\nand products.  In addition, having a Chief Client Officer acts to ensure we are disciplined in bringing the full \\npower of our franchise to our clients.  \\n \\nWe have now completed the divestitures of 9 of ou r 14 international consumer franchises and have wound \\ndown nearly 70% of our total retail loans and deposits in Russia, Korea and China.  We have restarted the \\nsales process in Poland and are well down the execution path for the Mexico IPO next year.   We are exiting \\nmarginal businesses such as Munis and a subset of distressed debt trading to focus on our core strengths \\nand allocate our capital with rigor.   \\n \\nWithout doubt, all these changes are difficult, but they are necessary.    At the same time, we con tinued to \\ninvest in our Transformation, risk and control environment and data architecture. We were pleased to have \\nclosed the FX consent order with the Federal Reserve.   We are committed to fulfilling the expectations of \\nour regulators given the unique r ole we play in the global financial system.  The modernization of our tech \\ninfrastructure is proceeding at pace allowing us to deliver new capabilities to our clients.  During the year, \\nwe consolidated trading and reporting platforms, and retired 6% of our  legacy applications for the second \\nyear in a row.  These enhancements dovetail with significant investments in our businesses, such as hiring \\ncommercial bankers to capture share, improving the digital payment capabilities we offer throughout our \\nglobal ne twork, and automating processes for our Securities Services clients.  It was also a year where we \\nupgraded talent with key internal promotions supplemented by selective external hires, including Andy \\nSieg.  The simplified reporting structure has been embra ced by colleagues who feel empowered by the new \\nstructure to serve clients and drive value for shareholders.  \\n \\n Earlier this week we disclosed additional external headwinds some of \\nwhich materialized in the second half of  December including a $1.3 billion reserve build related to transfer \\nrisk stemming from exposures to Argentina and Russia.   \\n \\nWe also saw a nearly $900 million negative revenue impact as a result of the larger than expected \\ndevaluation of the Argentine cur rency.  These items, together with the $1.7 billion FDIC assessment, drove \\nthis quarter to a negative EPS of $1.16.   While these items are clearly very painful, they are quite \\n In terms of the  performance of our five \\nbusinesses, while Services was the most impacted by the Argentine devaluation, the underlying growth \\nremains very strong, driven by share gains and client wins.  Overall, Services revenues were up 16% for the \\nfull year despite the impact of the Argentine devaluation.  In TTS, cross -border transactions were up 15% \\nand AUC/AUA in Securities Services were up by close to $3 trillion for the year.  In Markets, our Fixed Income \\nresults were disappointing as we saw a significant slowdown i n December particularly in Rates and FX.  \\nMarkets was also impacted by the Argentine devaluation. This franchise is well -positioned with our \\ncorporate clients and we continue to take actions to improve returns, whether by redeploying capital to \\nhigh -return\\n  \\n \\nWe had a decent quarter in Equities, particularly in derivatives, and saw growth in prime balances, an area \\nwe have been focusing on.  While activity picked up in the fourth quarter with revenues up 22%, overall \\nBanking revenue continued to be impacted by a weak wallet globally.  Investment Banking was up slightly \\nfor the year and we finished 2023 as the fifth leading franchise. We certai nly aspire to be better.  We are \\nseeing improved confidence among CEOs and we like our pipeline, but of course the timing for a robust \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Fourth  Quarter  202 3 Earnings  Call  \\nJanuary 12, 202 4 \\n \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   3 \\n recovery is uncertain.  The share gains we have made in areas such as healthcare put us in a good position \\nwhen this busi ness turns more decisively.   \\n \\nWhile investment activity in Asia rebounded with quarterly revenues up 21%, and Wealth at Work up 18% \\nwhere it needs to b e.   Andy is off to a fast start.  In addition to resetting the expense base and ensuring the \\nright utilization of our balance sheet, he is tightening our focus to build fee -based revenue streams and \\ninvestment AUM.  With $100 trillion in new wealth to be created by 2030, mainly in North America and Asia, \\nand with our clients holding $5.4 trillion away from us, we have an important ability here to drive growth \\nand returns to where they should be.   \\n \\nUSPB was a bright spot with every product up double -digits in the quarter compared to last year, including \\nRetail Banking which benefitted from a rebound in mortgage origination.  New and refreshed products have \\nincreased customer engagement as we see the benefits of the investments we have made. In Cards, IEB \\nand  ANR continued their growth, reflecting a more balanced lend vs spend mix and falling payment rates.  \\nAs expected, loss rates are now back to pre -pandemic levels driven by customers in the lower FICO bands.    \\n \\nIn terms of the full year, in 2023, we grew r evenues ex -divestitures by 4%, although the Argentine \\ndevaluation essentially prevented us from reaching the $78 billion revenue mark.  We met our full -year \\nexpense guidance and we increased our CET1 ratio to 13.3% during the year.  We grew our Tangible Bo ok \\nValue per share by 6% to $86.19 and returned $6 billion in capital to our shareholders in the form of \\ncommon dividends and share buybacks.  We remain committed to continuing to return capital to investors \\nthrough both of these channels.   \\n \\nAs I reflect o n the year, I also want to note that we were a source of strength for the system and clients \\nduring a volatile period for the banking sector and geopolitically.  And I am very proud of how our people \\naround the world performed during challenging times.  2024 looks to be similar to 2023 in terms of the \\nmacro environment with moderating rates and inflation.  We expect to see growth slowing globally, with \\nthe U.S. well positioned to withstand a run -of-the -mill recession should one materialize.   \\n \\nWith a strong  balance sheet, ample liquidity and diligent risk management, we are well positioned to \\nsupport our clients through whatever environment comes to pass.   Moreover, we think environments like \\nthese play to our strengths.  Given how far we are down the path o f our simplification and divestures, 2024 \\nwill be a turning point as we will be able to completely focus on the performance of our five businesses and \\nour Transformation.    \\n \\nI recognize the importance of this year and am highly confident we will see the b enefits of the actions we \\nhave taken through the momentum of our businesses.  Backed by investments in key products, we believe \\nwe can continue to grow revenues ex -divestitures by 4 to 5% over the medium term.   Overall, we remain \\nconfident in our ability to adapt to the evolving capital and macro environments to reach our medium -term \\nreturn targets and return capital to our shareholders, whilst continuing the investments needed in our \\ntransformation.    \\n \\nWith that, I would like to turn it over to Mark and then we would be delighted, as always, to take your \\nquestions.  \\n \\nMARK MASON : Thanks, Jane and good morning, everyone.  \\n  I am \\ngoing to start with the fourth quarter and full -year firmwide financial results, focusing on  year -over -year \\nour medium -term return target.  The presentation of our results reflects the changes we have made in \\nconjunction with our organizatio nal simplification including reporting Legacy Franchises and \\nCorporate/Other in All Other.  However, before I go into the results, let me walk you through some of the \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Fourth  Quarter  202 3 Earnings  Call  \\nJanuary 12, 202 4 \\n \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   4 \\n notable items that impacted the quarter that were included in the 8K we recently filed.   \\n \\nAt the top right of slide 7, we show these items on a pre -tax basis . The FDIC special assessment of \\napproximately $1.7 billion related to the regional bank failures in March. This impacted expenses in All \\nOther.  A restructuring charge of approximately $780  million related to actions associated with our \\norganizational simplification, which will drive headcount reductions and future savings over the medium -\\nterm, impacted expenses in All Other.  The impact of the currency devaluation in Argentina of approximate ly \\n$880 million. This was recorded in non -interest revenue across Services, Markets and Banking and you can \\nsee the impact by business in the appendix of the presentation.   \\n \\nWhile we did have an adverse impact from the Argentina devaluation this quarter, we also benefitted from \\nhigh interest rates, earning approximately $250 million of NII on the net investment in the quarter, given \\nthe hyperinflationary environment.  And a reserve build of $1.3 billion related to increases in transfer risk \\nassociated with exposures to Russia and Argentina as described in the 8K. This impact is mostly included \\nin other provisions in cost of credit and spans multiple businesses due to their globality.  The combination \\nof these items negatively impacted diluted EPS by approxima tely $2.00 and RoTCE by approximately 920 \\nbasis points.   \\n \\nNow turning to the left side of the slide, where we show our financial results for the full firm.  In the fourth \\nquarter, we reported a net loss of $1.8 billion and a net loss per share of $1.16 on $17.4 billion of revenues. \\nExcluding the notable items, diluted EPS would have been $0.84 with an RoTCE of 4.1% for the quarter.  In \\nthe quarter, total revenu es decreased by 3% on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture -related impacts and \\nthe impact of the Argentina devaluation, revenues increased 2%, driven by strength across Services, USPB, \\nand Investment Banking, partially offset by lower revenues in Market s and Wealth and the revenue \\nreduction from the closed exits and wind -downs.   \\n \\nTurning to expenses, we reported expenses of $16.0 billion, which include the FDIC special assessment and \\nmodest divestiture -related costs. Excluding these items, expenses incre ased 10% to $14.2 billion, largely \\ndriven by the restructuring charge I just mentioned.  Cost of credit was approximately $3.5 billion. Excluding \\nthe reserve build for transfer risk, cost of credit was primarily driven by Card net credit losses, which are \\nnow at pre -covid levels, as well as ACL builds for new card volumes.  At the end of the quarter, we had nearly \\n$22 billion in total reserves with a reserve -to-funded loans ratio of approximately 2.7%.  And on a full -year \\nbasis, we delivered $9.2 billion of ne t income and an RoTCE of 4.9%. Adjusting for the notable items, net \\nincome was approximately $13.1 billion with an RoTCE of 7.3%.  \\n  \\nOn slide 8, we show full year revenue trends by business from 2021 to 2023. It is important to highlight that \\nin conjunction  with the change to align with our new financial reporting structure, we moved the majority \\nof the Financing & Securitization business from Banking to Markets.  We also implemented a revenue \\nsharing arrangement within Banking, and between Banking, Services and Markets to reflect the benefit the \\nbusinesses get from our relationship -based lending. These changes are now reflected in our results and our \\nhistorical financials.    \\n \\nNow looking at the full year numbers .  Services had a record year with revenues of $18.1 billion, up 16%, \\nbenefiting from both rates and business actions, new client wins and deepening with existing clients, \\npartially offset by the Argentina devaluation.  Markets revenues decreased 6% to $18.9 billion, largely driven \\nby lower volatility a nd a significant slowdown in December. The Markets business was also impacted by \\nthe Argentina devaluation.   \\n \\nBanking revenues decreased 15% to $4.6 billion, primarily driven by the mark -to-market on loan hedges, \\nas well as a decrease in corporate lending . Investment Banking revenues were relatively flat for the year as \\nwe gained share amidst a declining wallet. Corporate Lending revenues were down 4%, excluding mark -to-\\nmarket on loan hedges.  Wealth revenues decreased 5% to $7.1 billion, primarily due to the deposit mix shift \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Fourth  Quarter  202 3 Earnings  Call  \\nJanuary 12, 202 4 \\n \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   5 \\n towards higher yielding products which drove lower deposit spreads.   \\n \\nUSPB revenues increased 14% to $19.2 billion, primarily driven by growth in cards balances as we continue \\nto see the benefit of our investments in digital acquisiti ons and customer engagement.  Total revenues \\nexcluding divestitures came in at $77.1 billion, below our guidance of $78 -79 billion for the year largely due \\nto the impact of the Argentina devaluation, softer Markets performance, particularly in December and \\nlosses on loan hedges. However, NII ex -Markets came in at $47.6 billion, in line with our guidance.  Despite \\nthe challenging environment and the impact of the Argentina devaluation, we grew firmwide revenues by \\nan approximately 4% ex -divestitures, in line w ith our investor day target, demonstrating the benefit of our \\n \\n  \\nOn slide 9, we show full year expense trends from 2021 to 2023.  Excluding the FDIC special assessment \\nand divestiture -related impacts, full -year expenses were $54.3 billion for 2023, in line with our guidance.  \\nAs I mentioned, this includes roughly $780 million of restructuring costs associated with our organizational \\nsimplification and additional severance costs of approximately  $730 million, which included actions to \\naddress stranded costs and start to right size the businesses.   \\n \\nRelative to the prior year, expense growth continued to be driven by Transformation and business -led \\ninvestments, volume -related expenses and other i nvestments in risk and controls and technology, partially \\noffset by productivity savings and a reduction in expenses in Legacy Franchises, within All Other.  Over the \\nperformance \\nof the firm but also the businesses.  \\n  \\nOn slide 10, we show the components of our transformation and technology spend from 2021 to 2023.  Over \\nthe past three years, we have invested significantly in our infrastructure, platforms, applications, p rocesses \\nand data.   And as you can see in the bar chart, at the top of the slide, roughly 30% of our Transformation \\ninvestments over the last three years were in technology, with the remainder related to non -tech employees \\nand consultants.   \\n \\ne seen a shift from consulting expenses to technology and compensation as we have gotten \\ndeeper into the execution of our Transformation  And you should expect to see this trend continue  In total, \\nwe invested over $12 billion in technology in 2023. Beyond transformation, our technology investments are \\nalso focused on digital innovation, new product development, client experience enhancements and areas \\nthat support our infrastructure like cloud and cyber.   \\n  \\nOn slide 11, we show key consumer and corpo rate credit metrics.  Across Branded Cards and Retail Services \\napproximately 80% of our card loans are to consumers with FICO scores of 680 or higher.  And across both \\nportfolios, NCL rates have reached pre -covid levels but we continue to be well reserved w ith a reserve to \\nfunded loan ratio of 7.7%.  In our Corporate portfolio, the majority of our exposure is investment grade which \\nis reflected in our low level of non -accrual loans, at 63 basis points of total corporate loans.  We feel good \\nabout the quality and mix of our portfolio and are well reserved for the current environment.   \\n \\nnetwork and the broader institutional client relationships we ho ld, as well as the strength of our financial \\nprofile in Argentina.  As it relates to Russia, we have also included a slide in the appendix.  You will see that \\nthe reserves for transfer risk that we have taken have significantly reduced our net investment an d therefore \\nour risk of loss related to Russia.  \\n  \\nOn slide 12, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics.  We maintain a very \\nstrong $2.4 trillion balance sheet which is funded in part by a well -diversified $1.3 trillion deposi t base \\nwhich is deployed into high -quality, diversified assets.  The majority of our deposits, $801 billion, are \\ninstitutional and operational in nature and span across 90 countries and are complemented by $426 billion \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Fourth  Quarter  202 3 Earnings  Call  \\nJanuary 12, 202 4 \\n \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   6 \\n of U.S. Personal Banking and Wealth d eposits.  We have approximately $561 billion of HQLA and \\napproximately $690 billion of loans and we maintain total liquidity resources of $965 billion.  Our LCR \\ndecreased modestly to 116%.  And our tangible book value per share was $86.19, up 6%.   \\n \\nOn the bot tom left corner of the slide, we show a full year CET1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers in \\n2023.  First, we generated $8.0 billion of net income to common, which added 70 basis points.  Second, we \\nreturned $6.1 billion in the form of common divid ends and share repurchases, which drove a reduction of \\nabout 53 basis points.  Third, we benefitted from the impact of lower rates on our AFS investment portfolio, \\nwhich drove an increase of 20 basis points.  And finally, the remaining 3 basis points was la rgely driven by \\nhigher RWA, partially offset by capital releases from the exit markets.  We ended the quarter with a 13.3% \\nCET1 capital ratio, approximately 100 basis points above our regulatory capital requirement of 12.3%.   As \\nyou can see, we have grown our CET1 ratio by approximately 30 basis points over the course of the year \\nwhile returning over $6 billion to shareholders in common dividends and repurchases.   \\n \\nBefore I take you through each business, as Jane mentioned, we are not satisfied with the performance and \\nreturns of our businesses and therefore we are laser focused on executing against our strategy, simplifying \\nthe organization and right sizing the expe nse base. As a reminder the investments that we have been \\nmaking have impacted each of the businesses as you will see in the next few slides.   \\n \\nSo now turning to slide 13, where we show the results for Services for the fourth quarter and the full year.  \\nRevenues were up 6% this quarter, largely driven by NII across TTS and Securities Services, partially offset \\nby NIR driven by the Argentina devaluation.  Services non -interest revenues were up 20% excluding the \\nimpact of the Argentina devaluation.  Expenses i ncreased 9%, primarily driven by continued investments in \\ntechnology, product innovation and client experience.  Cost of credit was $646 million, driven by a reserve \\nbuild of approximately $652 million, primarily associated with transfer risk in Russia and Argentina.  Net \\nincome decreased to $776 million, as higher revenues were more than offset by higher cost of credit and \\nhigher expenses.  Average loans were up 6%, primarily driven by strong demand for working capital loans in \\nTTS, both in North America and  internationally.  Average deposits were down 3% as the impact of \\nquantitative tightening more than offset new client acquisitions and deepening with existing clients, \\nhowever sequentially, deposits were up 1%.  Services delivered an RoTCE of 13.4% for the q uarter.  And for \\nthe full year, Services delivered an RoTCE of 20% on $18.1 billion of revenues.  \\n \\nOn slide 14, we show the results for Markets for the fourth quarter and the full year. Markets revenues were \\ndown 19%, versus a strong quarter last year, driven by a decline in fixed income and the impact of the \\ndevaluation, partially offset by an increase  in equities.  Fixed Income revenues decreased by 25%, largely \\ndriven by rates and currencies on lower volatility and a significant slowdown in December as well as the \\nimpact of devaluation.   However, we saw good underlying momentum in equities, with reve nues up 9%, \\ndriven by gains across all products.  And we continued to grow prime balances while making solid progress \\non our revenue -to-RWA target.  Expenses increased 8%, driven by investments in transformation and risk \\nand controls and volume related costs , partially offset by productivity savings.  Cost of credit was $209 \\nmillion, driven by a reserve build of approximately $179 million, primarily associated with the transfer risk \\nin Russia and Argentina.  Markets reported a net loss of $134 million, as reve nues were more than offset by \\nhigher expenses and higher cost of credit.  Average loans increased 4% to $115 billion, as we saw increased \\nclient demand for credit driving growth in warehouse lending.  Average trading assets increased 18% to \\n$391 billion, la rgely driven by treasuries and mortgage -backed securities, given the strong client activity in \\nfixed income for much of the year.  While it was a challenging quarter, Markets performed relatively well for \\nthe full year with revenue of $18.9 billion and an R oTCE of 7.4%, compared with very strong performance in \\nthe prior year. And we are focused on improving returns over time through a combination of revenue growth, \\nexpense discipline, and capital optimization.  \\n  \\nOn slide 15, we show the results for Banking f or the fourth quarter and the full year.  Banking revenues \\nincreased 22%, driven by growth in investment banking fees and lower losses on loan hedges, partially \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Fourth  Quarter  202 3 Earnings  Call  \\nJanuary 12, 202 4 \\n \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   7 \\n offset by lower Corporate Lending revenue.  Investment banking revenues increased 27% YoY, driv en by \\nDCM and Advisory due to improvements in market sentiment. In Advisory, we saw signs of strength across \\nTechnology, Healthcare and Energy, and we feel good about the strength of our pipeline.  Corporate Lending \\nrevenues excluding mark -to-market on loan  hedges decreased 26%, largely driven by lower revenue share \\nfrom Investment Banking, Services and Markets.  Expenses increased 37%, primarily driven by the absence \\nof an operational loss reserve release in the prior year. Excluding the reserve release, ex penses were roughly \\nflat.  Cost of credit was $185 million, driven by a reserve build associated with the transfer risk in Russia and \\nArgentina. The NCL rate was 32 basis points of average loans and we ended the quarter with a reserve to \\nfunded loan ratio o f 1.6%.  Banking reported a net loss of $322 million as higher expenses and cost of credit \\nmore than offset higher revenues.  RoTCE was negative 6.0% for the quarter.  And for the full year, Banking \\nreported an RoTCE of negative 0.2% on $4.6 billion of reven ues.  So clearly, we have more work to do on \\ncapitalize on the rebound in the market wallet. And that includes continuing to invest in key growth a reas, \\nupgrading talent in traditional sectors, and continuing to right size the business.  \\n  \\nOn slide 16, we show the results for Wealth for the fourth quarter and the full year.  Wealth revenues \\ndecreased 3%, driven by lower deposit spreads, partially offs et by lower mortgage funding cost and higher \\n-interest revenue, which was up 13% in the \\nfourth quarter, driven by higher investment assets, increased client activity and market performance.  \\nExpenses  were up 4%, primarily driven by investments in risk and controls and technology, partially offset \\nby re -pacing strategic investments and tighter expense control as we begin to right size the expense base \\nin the business.  Wealth reported net income of $5 m illion, as revenues were mostly offset by higher \\nexpenses.  Client balances increased 6%, primarily driven by higher client investment assets, partially offset \\nby lower deposit balances.  Average loans were flat, as we continued to optimize capital usage.  Average \\ndeposits decreased 2%, reflecting the continued mix shift of deposits to higher -yielding investments on \\n Client investment assets were up 12%, driven by new acquisitions and the benefit from \\nhigher market valuations.  \\n  good momentum in net new assets, which more than doubled \\nto $16 billion for the quarter. For the full year, we added an estimated $21 billion in net new assets.  RoTCE \\nwas 0.1% for the quarter.  And for the full year, RoTCE was 2.6% on $7.1 billion of reven ues.  Looking ahead, \\nstrategy to drive investment revenue with an eye toward right sizing the expense base. We will wind down \\nnon -core initiatives, exit l ess productive performers and enhance discipline across every expense line.  \\n  \\nOn slide 17, we show the results for US Personal Banking for the fourth quarter and the full year.  US Personal \\nBanking revenues increased 12%.  Branded Cards revenues increased 10%, driven by higher net interest \\nmargin and interest -earning balance growth of 13%. And we continue to see healthy growth in new account \\nacquisitions, up 8% and spend volumes up 3%.  Retail Services revenues increased 15%, also driven by \\nhigher net interest margin and interest -earning balance growth of 11%, as well as lower partner payments \\ndue to higher net credit losses.  Retail Banking revenues increased 15%, driven by higher deposit spreads, \\nloan growth and improved mortgage margins.  Expenses  decreased 1%, as higher expenses to support \\nlending programs and client engagement, as well as the rollout of Simplified Banking were offset by lower \\nnon -volume related expenses.  Cost of credit of $2.1 billion increased 20%, driven by higher NCLs, partial ly \\noffset by a lower ACL build.  Net income increased to $201 million, driven by higher revenues, partially offset \\nby higher cost of credit.  Average deposits decreased 5%, driven by the transfer of relationships and the \\nassociated deposits to our Wealth bu siness.  We continued to make progress against our digital strategy, \\nwith digital deposits up 14% and active digital users increasing 6%.  RoTCE for the quarter was 3.6%.  And \\nfor the full year, US Personal Banking delivered an ROTCE of 8.3% on $19.2 billio n of revenue.  Here again, \\nwe are focused on improving the return profile of the business, managing through this part of the credit \\ncycle and continuing to make progress in Retail Banking will be key.  \\n \\nOn slide 18, we show results for All Other on a managed  basis, which includes Corporate Other and Legacy \\nFranchises and excludes divestiture -related items.  Revenues decreased 17%, driven by a decrease in NII of \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Fourth  Quarter  202 3 Earnings  Call  \\nJanuary 12, 202 4 \\n \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   8 \\n 29%, largely driven by the closed exits and wind -downs, partially offset by higher non -interest reve nue.  \\nAnd expenses increased to $4.5 billion, driven by the FDIC special assessment and restructuring costs, \\npartially offset by lower expenses in both wind -down and exit markets.    \\n \\nTurning to slide 20, as we kick off 2024, the environment remains somewha t uncertain and Markets \\nremains difficult to predict, but based on what we see today we expect revenues to be approximately $80 \\nto $81 billion as shown on the left side of the slide.  And on the right side of the slide, we list the key drivers.  \\nIn TTS, we expect revenue growth to be driven by new client wins, deepening with our existing clients and \\ncontinued momentum with Commercial Clients as we continue to leverage our global footprint and product \\ninnovations.  In Securities Services, we have a very healt hy pipeline and will continue to onboard assets \\nunder custody from new mandates, win new clients and deepen relationships with existing clients.  In \\nInvestment Banking we anticipate a rebound in activity and to maintain our position as the wallet recovers. \\ntechnology, to allow us to gain share.  And we also expect a modest rebound in Wealth, as we execute on \\nour refocused strategy with an eye towards growing in vestment fees, particularly with our existing clients.  \\nIn USPB, we expect continued growth in cards balances driven by the investments we have been making as \\nwell as lower partner payments in retail services to continue to drive revenue growth. We also exp ect to \\ncontinue to improve our retail branch performance.  And as it relates to NII, excluding Markets, we expect \\nnet interest income to be down modestly as the volume growth we expect from loans and deposits is more \\nthan offset by lower US rates and the r eduction from the closed exits and wind -downs.   \\n  \\nTurning to slide 21, we expect expenses to be approximately $53.5 to $53.8 billion, down from $54.3 \\nbillion, subject to volume -related expenses.  The decrease in expenses will be driven by the benefits of o ur \\norganizational simplification, a continued reduction from exit markets and wind -downs, and productivity \\nsavings, partially offset by investments in risk and controls and volume -related expenses.  Embedded in \\nthis guidance includes an elevated level of se verance, as well as additional potential costs related to the \\norganizational simplification totaling approximately $700 million to $1 billion.  This will contribute to \\nreducing headcount over 2024 and the medium term, which we will discuss on the next slid e.  \\n  \\nOn slide 22, we show the drivers of headcount and expense reduction over the medium -term.  \\ndiscussed in the past, there are three drivers that will reduce our expenses.  Organizational simplification \\nincluding the reduction of management layer s. Eliminating stranded costs as we take additional actions to \\nreduce excess overhead in light of the exit markets.  And realizing productivity savings from our investments \\nin the transformation and technology.  We expect the combination of these three drive rs to reduce our \\nheadcount by a net 20 thousand, excluding Mexico, and generate a net run rate save of $2 to $2.5 billion \\nover the medium term.  This will underpin our path to $51 to $53 billion of expenses, subject to volume -\\nrelated expenses.  Both the he adcount and expense reduction will allow us to right size the firm and \\nbusinesses to improve performance and returns.   \\n \\nOn slide 23, we show our outlook for U.S. Cards in 2024.  In terms of credit performance, based on the \\nabove pre -COVID levels and peak in 2024.  On a full -year basis for 2024, we expect the Branded Cards NCL  \\nrate to be in the range of 3.5% to 4.0% and the Retail Services NCL rate to be in the range of 5.75% to 6.25%.  \\nFrom an allowance perspective, we are reserved for a weighted 8 -quarter average unemployment rate of \\nalmost 5.0%, which imbeds a downside scena rio of approximately 6.8%.  ACL builds in 2024 will primarily \\nbe a function of the volume growth that we see as well as changes in the macro scenarios and the \\nprobabilities associated with them.  And we expect continued momentum in cards albeit more in line with \\nmid -single digit loan growth.  \\n  \\nOn slide 24, we summarize our medium -term targets.  While a lot has changed in the macro environment \\nsince Investor Day, our strategy has not, and we are on a path to the 11 -12% RoTCE in the medium term, \\ndriven by top l ine revenue growth and expense reductions.  From a revenue perspective, we continue to \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Fourth  Quarter  202 3 Earnings  Call  \\nJanuary 12, 202 4 \\n \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   9 \\n expect a 4 -5% revenue CAGR in the medium -term, including the ongoing reduction of revenue from the \\nclosing of the exits and the wind -downs.  From an expense perspective, we are now on the path to lowering \\nour expenses, beginning in 2024.  From a credit perspective, we expect credit costs to be a function of \\nportfolio mix, volumes and macro assumptions.  And we are committed to returning capital to our \\nshareholders and in f act expect to do modest buybacks in 1Q 2024.  \\n \\nSo, to wrap it up, while the world has changed significantly and the components have shifted since Investor \\nDay, our strategy has not. And we are confident we are on the right path to deliver our 11 -12% RoTCE i n the \\nmedium term.   \\n \\nWith that, Jane and I will be happy to take your questions.  \\n \\nQUESTION AND ANSWER  \\n \\nOPERATOR : Our first question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.  Your line is now open. Please go \\nahead.  \\n \\nMIKE MAYO :  Hi. I looked in detail at the earnings presentation, especially slide 4, and I think the question is, \\non many people's minds, I count 12 restructurings at Citigroup. And I count 12 restructurings  that have failed \\nat Citigroup. You might disagree with the number 12, It cou ld be 5, it could be 8, it could be 12, it could be \\nmore, but I've not spoken to one person of any investor who would say that Citi has succeeded on its prior \\nrestructuring. So, the question is, why is this time different? Number one, who is this new and i mproved \\nCitigroup.  Number two, why aren't expenses down even move, especially when few people that I talk to think \\nyou'll hit your revenue target? And three, Jane, what is your conviction level of getting to that 11% to 12% \\nRoTCE in 2025 or 2026? Thank you . \\n \\nJANE FRASER:  Well, thank you very much indeed, Mike. I'll start with, who is Citi? Citi is, I'm delighted to say, \\nfinally simple. At Investor Day, I set out a vision to be the preeminent banking partner for clients with cross \\nborder needs. That vision w as based on five core interconnected businesses. We set off on a deliberate path \\nto get there, and over the last three years we've done so.   \\n \\nPage 4 is who we are today. We are five interconnected businesses; no more, no less. We have our \\norganization that  now aligns with those five businesses, and this enables us to focus on two priorities. The \\nfirst is improving the performance and the returns of those five core businesses, so that we can meet the \\nmedium -term RoTCE target we laid out. And the second is on  addressing our regulatory issues through the \\ntransformation. And I would also be , I need to note that I fully recognize that 2024 is an inflection year, Mike. \\nAnd I and the management team are accountable to deliver. And that you and our investors have th e \\ntransparency you need to hold us accountable.   \\n \\nSo, why is this time different? Look , it's not lost on me that there's been many attempts in the past to change \\nthis firm. I and the management are fully committed to transforming this company for the long term  and we \\nare addressing the issues that have held us back in the past. And you've got proof points of the last three  \\nyears where we've made a lot of tough decisions and we have put through a tremendous amount of change \\nto get to the simple Citi tha t we are today. We completely reset our strategy. So, we now have a significantly \\nmore focused business and operating model.  \\n \\nWe've announced the most consequential set of changes to our organizational model, and frankly, from my \\nperspective, more importan tly, how we run the bank, since the financial crisis, aimed at simplifying the bank \\nand increasing accountability. You've seen \\n  move d quickly. We're on track with our execution of this \\neffort. And it will generate over $1 billion of run rate saves the  end of the first quarter, purely from the \\norganization efforts that we've put in that we announced in September.  We've done this while investing  and \\nI think this is another difference. We've invested heavily in our transformation. And while that was catal yzed \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Fourth  Quarter  202 3 Earnings  Call  \\nJanuary 12, 202 4 \\n \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   10 \\n by our consent orders, these investments will ultimately deliver benefits from automation, from well -\\ngoverned data, from consolidated platforms. We also have made significant investments in our business to \\nsupport the 4% to 5% revenue growth and to en sure client momentum. And those investments have helped \\nus expand our product suite, invest in digital capabilities, automate our processes, capture synergies \\nthrough the client organization.   \\n \\nWe've also brought in some incredible external talent in key s trategic areas, including Andy, to lead Wealth. \\nAnd we now have a good balance between experienced Citi people and external talent with fresh \\nperspectives through multiple layers of the organization. So, we are doing things the right way, we're doing \\nit fo r the long term and we're moving with urgency. We will need and are spending the money that we need \\nto, to address our regulatory requirements, but that's already embedded in our path to the 11% to 12% RoTCE \\nin the medium term.  And this already feels like a different bank. We have more work to do. I recognize 2024 \\nis a critical year,  and as I said, the decks are much clearer now, so that we can focus on two imperatives: \\nimproving our business performance and executing the transformation. Neither is an entir ely linear path as \\nwe've seen over the last three  years. We all know that. We get we have to build our credibility. We're \\ncommitted to doing so. And we are providing far more transparency around the business performance, so \\ninvestors have a better sense of  how we're doing. And I and my management team, to your final question, are \\nfully accountable for getting this all done. We will.  \\n \\nMark, expenses?  \\n \\nMARK MASON: Yeah , thanks, Jane. And why aren't expenses down more? I think to your point, Jane, we've \\nbeen i nvesting in the franchise both on the front -end, and importantly, on the transformation and the risk \\nand controls. What I would point out is that, in 2023, we delivered expenses of $54.3 billion ex the FDIC \\ncharge. That is the guidance that we gave. But I also highlight that we also included $780 million associated \\nwith the restructuring charge. That is more than I had articulated in the way of guidance. So, the capacity \\nthat we created through our efforts through the year, we use that in a smart way. We us e that to fund the org \\nsimplification cost, so that we can realize the savings down the line. And we're going to continue to manage \\nour expenses in a disciplined and smart fashion. That means spending what we need to spend on the \\ntransformation and risk an d controls, but driving greater efficiencies and productivities along the way to \\nensure we get to that 11% to 12%. And to your point, if revenues are to come down or come in lower than \\nexpected, we'll adjust the expenses accordingly . \\n \\nOPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open.  \\n \\nGLENN SCHORR : Hi. Thanks very much. So, you're clearly making a lot of progress  and I hate to like, ask this \\nquestion too early, but I think it is important. Your expense guidance  is good , your revenue guide  is good , and \\nyou have your arms around the expenses. The question I have is, how do you think about balancing that near -\\nterm profitability improvement that we all want desperately with making sure you do make the right \\ninvestments? Because if you look around the w orld there's a lot of places to grow, whether it be a branch \\nnetwork, or the wealth management aspirations that you have, or the digital investments. So, how do we \\nknow that all the right future investments are being made while you extract costs in all the  good ways that \\nyou've been doing?  \\n \\nMARK MASON:  Yeah , thanks, Glenn. I guess, I'll start, and Jane, feel free to add in on it. Look, it is a balancing \\nact, right, and we do look at each of our five core businesses. We obviously are clear on the strategy, b ut \\nwhere's the growth? Where are the return opportunities associated with them? And how do we ensure we're \\ndeploying resources after them in order to deliver for the client and deliver on those returns over time? We \\nhave to juxtapose that against the requi red investment to modernize our operations and we're making those \\ntrade -offs on a regular basis.  But importantly, when we do invest to capture those growth opportunities, \\nwe're trying to be agile about it, which means if those opportunities don't play out in the way we're expecting \\nbecause the cycle just doesn't mature or materialize in that fashion, we've got to be disciplined enough to \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Fourth  Quarter  202 3 Earnings  Call  \\nJanuary 12, 202 4 \\n \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   11 \\n dial them back, and that's what you've seen over the past year plus, is that we've been investing in the \\nbusiness. Where we didn't see the upside that we anticipated, we dialed back that spend, right , and that's \\nthe type of iterative process, if you will, Glenn, that we're putting in place to ensure that on the other side of \\nthis, we're still positioned to capture growth.  Investment Banking, for example, we have invested in \\nhealthcare, in technology, building out to prepare ourselves for when that market rebounds. We feel good \\nabout that. We've done similar things in the way of our Wealth business. We're investing heavily in our TTS \\nfranchise to ensure we can remain competitive there , so it's that type of discipline that's required. It is \\nsometimes a trade -off, but it's one that we've been very focused on being smart about.  \\n \\nGLENN SCHORR : I appreciate that. Maybe a quickie on Services. Obviously, up 16% and a record is great. I \\ndon't know if you've dimensionalized how much was rate versus new business, but you have good core \\nbusiness momentum and a pipeline of won, but not yet funded. So I guess the question is, where can Servi ces \\nbe over, let's say, the next two years in terms of growth, while rates come down, yet your businesses is \\nwinning new wins?  \\n \\nMARK MASON : Yeah, sure. You want me to , sure.  \\n \\nJANE FRASER : Yeah  and I'll jump in, too. Let's maybe start with TTS. When we thin k about the performance \\nof TTS, which, as we say, the growth this year up 19% ex -Argentina, came from a combination of both rates \\nand the strong  business actions we've taken. And you can see that in the different drivers. Cross -border was \\nup 23%, commercia l cards up 8%.  In terms of the growth prospects, we've generated 22% in average revenue \\ngrowth, from 21 to 23, well ahead of the Investor Day guidance we had of high -single digit s. That was not just \\nbecause of the rate cycle. It obviously helped. And we ce rtainly expect to grow revenues at mid -single digit \\nnow as we lap the prior periods that benefited from those rate increases, and that's going to come from a few \\ndifferent areas.   \\n \\nOne, the focus on our fee strategy, where we're capitalizing on strong clie nt engagement, market -leading \\nclient solutions, and we're delivering on a lot of the different growth initiatives that we've been investing in \\nacross all our client segments. We'll continue optimizing our deposit bo ok and bringing in high -quality \\ndeposits.  And in a lower rate environment, GDP is typically higher, so you'd expect to see some higher growth \\nin our capital -efficient payment volumes.   \\n \\nYou'll see us continuing to acquire new clients and deepen relationships with existing clients. And I'd point \\nto our confidence here, 27% increase in our new client acquisition this year and a sustained win/loss ratio of \\n82% on new deals , and that was across different client segments. And revenues from these clients just \\ncontinues to ramp up, as we expand across the different geographies and product suites with them.  And \\nyou'll also continue to see us investing in the infrastructure and pl atforms we've been doing, launching new \\ninnovative products. And we're seeing momentum from some of the things we've recently done: Citi Token \\nServices, Payment Express, 24/7 Clearing, et cetera. So I think, the main takeaway from TTS is that we'll \\ncontinu e to invest in it. We expect to see strong client momentum. We've been getting consistently good \\nclient feedback regarding our capabilities, so we expect to see good global growth that will certainly help as \\nthe rate cycle comes down. And it is a crown jew el for a reason.   \\n \\nAnd then, just quickly on Securities Services. I think where we're seeing , we mentioned, we've got a number \\nof marquee wins there across all the client segments. That pipeline is both investors and issuers. And one of \\nthe core strategies  that Okan put in place was to grow share with the US -based asset managers. We were at \\n2.6% share in 2020; we're now at 4.3%. And a lot of the growth in the pipeline has been coming, not only \\nfrom our global network names, but also from the marquee players  in the US asset manager space. I think \\nthat's our ability to connect our capabilities that gives these players huge efficiencies for our clients.   \\n \\nMark, anything I've missed there?  You know I love this business . \\n \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Fourth  Quarter  202 3 Earnings  Call  \\nJanuary 12, 202 4 \\n \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   12 \\n MARK MASON: As you should rightfully  so, high -returning business, great growth prospects. To answer one \\nof your questions, Glenn, about half of the NII growth, we could attribute to interest rates. And about half, \\nI'd say, is business action,  so us working with the clients to drive that momentum.  And then, if you think \\nabout the noninterest revenue, for Services, they're up about 20% in the quarter year -over -year if you \\nexclude the impact of the Argentina devaluation , and up 7% on a full year basis. And so, good momentum in \\nthe noninterest revenue  growth as well.  \\n \\nOPERATOR : Our next question comes from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Your line is now \\nopen.  \\n \\nJOHN MCDONALD: Hi good morning.  Mark, was hoping to ask you, how are you thinking about the pacing \\nof capital build? Obviously, the Basel III proposals are out there, but they could change, of course. Even if \\nthey don't change, you have a couple of years to leg into those with the phase -ins and perhaps some \\nmitigation opportunities. How should we think about you kind of building capital, given all those variables \\nand the ability to buy back some stock along the way as you mentioned earlier?  \\n \\nMARK MASON: Sure , so look, John, obviously the Basel III proposal's still out there and under discussion. \\nWe've been very vocal about the potential impact of that. We've also been very disciplined about how we've \\nbeen managing our capital. We've built that over 30 basis points over the course of the year. You've seen us \\nactively manage that through the year, and we're going to cont inue to do that. We obviously generate \\nearnings that contribute to that. We want to continue to drive growth across the business.  \\n \\nWe're trading at a 0.5 times book , where we can, we want to buy back as much as we can in shares. And we \\ntry to be discipline d about that over the past couple of quarters, doing that as a modest level. You heard me \\nsay, we're going to do that again this quarter at a modest level, but we have to be thoughtful about what \\nthose headwinds might look like. And we're actively working what mitigation actions we have to put in place, \\nshould it turn out closer to the way the current proposal sits.  \\n \\nSo, it's an ongoing active management that tries to balance servicing our client needs, with, obviously, \\nholding a responsible amount of capit al in light of the uncertainty that's out there, and with an eye towards \\nbuybacks where we can do that.  \\n \\nJOHN MCDONALD:  Okay. And just as an expense follow -up, I wasn't clear. Has the transformation spend \\npeaked, when you think about what you'll spend on t ransformation this year versus last year? And are the \\ntransformation benefits starting to kick in at this point?  \\n \\nMARK MASON:  Yeah. So to be clear, we're going to continue to spend whatever we need to spend on the \\ntransformation and on risk and controls. A nd so, we did see a tick up this year. We've got a plan for 2024 , and \\nif we've got to spend a bit more than we spent this year, we're going to spend more. That's what the plan calls \\nfor, and so that's what we'll do. That's inside of the number that I've gi ven you for guidance, all right. And so, \\nthat's important for us. I think it will drive, obviously, operational improvement and saves down the line.  \\n \\nIt is part of the $2 billion to $2.5 billion, but that is the early stage, if you will, of the transformat ion spend \\npaying back. I think as we talked about at Investor Day, frankly, we'll continue to see expense benefits \\nbeyond the medium term from some of this transformation investment that we've been making. And so, I \\nwould think of the medium term as the st art of the benefits that we'll see from the investments we've been \\nmaking in transformation and risk and controls.  \\n \\nJANE FRASER:  Yeah. I think, Mark, you're spot on. So we'll continue making the investments we need to in \\nthe transformation. It's a multi -year journey, as we've always been clear around this, ultimately, with \\nbenefits to the shareholders. And more of the expense saves that we've been talking about are, I'd separate \\nout transformation from sort of the operating expense base of our businesses, w hich we want to make sure \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Fourth  Quarter  202 3 Earnings  Call  \\nJanuary 12, 202 4 \\n \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   13 \\n is as productive and as effective as possible.  \\n \\nAnd the types of benefits we're seeing. This is the second year in a row that we've retired 6% of our legacy \\nplatform base. And you've heard me talking about moving 20 of our cash eq uity platforms on to 1, 6 reporting \\nledgers on to 1, 11 sanctioned platforms on to 1. So we start seeing some of the benefits of those come in.  \\n \\nOther things, we automated independent price verification for 90% of our prioritized fixed income and equity \\nsecurities. That's reduced manual controls. That's improved valuation consistency. That's also had an impact \\non the efficiency of the business. We've loaded 98% of our prioritized wholesale and consumer data into two \\nauthorized repositories. That will also b egin to start having some benefits for us.  \\n \\nSo there is a cumulative effect that is beginning to build now from all the work we've done, but it will take \\nsome time to really kick into the , as Mark said, when you really feel it, is a few years out. But we'l l keep giving \\nyou the proof points of things as we're going, so it's not a just trust us that i\\n s coming, you'll begin to see it \\nbuild.  \\n \\nOPERATOR: Our next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is now open.  \\n \\nJIM MITCHELL:  Hey , good afternoon. Mark, maybe just to follow up on the expense, slide 22, where you talk \\nabout $2 billion to  $2.5 billion of expense saves. I guess I'm struggling with the numbers there. I think if you \\nlook at exit and wind - down markets, you're probably c lose to $2 billion in numbers there. And maybe the \\nstranded costs, you can't get all of that out. You're doing about \\n  severance is $700 million to $1 billion in \\n2024. So doesn't seem like there's a ton of actual cost saves in that number. And just maybe I 'm wrong, if you \\ncould just kind of walk me through the numbers embedded in there and if there's , you've kind of eluded to \\nmore to come beyond the intermediate term.  \\n \\nMARK MASON: Yeah , I think the thing I'd point out to you is a couple things. One, obvious ly, we're forecasting \\nrevenue growth over this period of time. And so, there's going to be volume -related expenses associated with \\nthat. The second thing I'd point out, as I just mentioned to the prior question, is that we're continuing to \\ninvest in risk a nd controls and in the transformation over this period of time.  \\n \\nAnd so, what you see is there's an increase in expenses associated with at least those two things. And that's \\noffset by the savings that we're starting to generate, particularly from the org simplification that Jane has \\ntalked about, as well as from the stranded cost reduction that will continue to play out, as well as from some \\nof the rightsizing of businesses that we've referenced in some of the prepared remarks. And so, important to \\nthink about, there are headwinds and tailwinds that kind of net down to this $2 billion to $2.5 billion.  \\n \\nAnd then the final point that I'd make is if I look at this medium -term number of $51 billion to $53 billion that \\nstill has Mexico in it and one of the o ther pages we'd point to, expenses around Mexico. But because of where \\nwe are, we'll be in the IPO process, that's still going to be part of this expense base, and so you can't lose sight \\nof that.  \\n \\nJIM MITCHELL:  Well, that's an important clarification that  the $2 billion to $2.5 billion includes revenue -\\nrelated volume growth, so that's helpful. And then, just maybe the other , on the slides talking about revenue \\ntargets. One of the big numbers not talked about was Markets. How are you thinking , volatility ha s come in, \\nmacro picture\\n s getting better, maybe that  mutes volatility , how do you think about that business in 2024 \\nas it relates to your guidance?  \\n \\nMARK MASON:  As you know, it's a tough business to forecast, certainly, for a full year, and in some instan ces \\nfor a quarter, and so, we've basically kind of backed that out but we assume markets kind of flat to modestly \\ndown, but we've backed it out, and it's roughly flat. Not of the $80 billion to $81 billion, right, you see the \\nguidance of NIR ex - Markets an d NII ex -Markets, so in the $80 billion to $81 billion, we've assumed it roughly \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Fourth  Quarter  202 3 Earnings  Call  \\nJanuary 12, 202 4 \\n \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   14 \\n flat.  \\n \\nJIM MITCHELL:  Okay , great. Thank you.  \\n \\nOPERATOR:  Our next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Your line is now \\nopen.  \\n \\nEBRAHIM POONAWALA:  Mor ning, afternoon, Jane. Just wanted to follow up on something I think Mark said \\nat the end of his very first response around , it's very hard in my seat to figure out whether you're going to grow \\nrevenues or shrink revenues given the macro. Should we take it  based on what you've said today as we look \\ninto 2026 getting to that 11% RoTCE, if for whatever reason, revenue falls short and you feel good about the \\nexpense flex  to mitigate that headwind?  \\n \\nJANE FRASER:  It's Jane, obviously. I want to just jump in on o ne bit, which is we are committed and we're \\nvery confident around the 4% to 5% revenue growth rate, so there isn't any backing away from that number. \\nAnd that's in various macro environments, et cetera. And as we look across the different businesses, and t he \\nprojections we have, we're confident around that. Obviously, if there's a very adverse macro environment, et \\ncetera, we've got other levers we can take, but Mark, let me pass it to you.  \\n \\nMARK MASON:  And by no means was I trying to suggest that we weren't confident in the forecast for the top \\nline. If you think about the strategy and the strength of those five core businesses, we've got a lot of \\nconviction around that. With that said, as you point out, Jane, under a circumstance where that doesn't p lay \\nout, there are obviously volume -related incentive comp expenses and the like that would naturally come \\ndown. We'd ensure that they came down with the revenue decline or shortfall. And then we'd recalibrate \\nother spend, other investments , spend not rela ted to risk and controls and transformation, but other \\ninvestments across the platform, we'd recalibrate accordingly.  \\n \\nEBRAHIM POONAWALA:  Well said. Just what I needed. And one quick question. As we think about \\nrightsizing the Markets business, there have been headlines around the muni and the distressed business \\nthat you've gotten out. Is there a risk where the Markets business becomes too small and you lag the scale \\nto be sort of efficient and relevant in certain , or just across the breadth of, be it, fix ed income or equities? Just \\nif you can talk about that. Thank you.  \\n \\nJANE FRASER:  The short answer is no. If you think about our Markets business, we have four businesses, \\neach of which are around sort of $4 billion or so in size. You have our global FX net work, where we're typically \\nnumber one in any year, just given the strength, and particularly, the corporate client base we've set off. \\nRates , typically top three. Together, these are two of the largest macro pools within FICC.  \\n \\nIn terms of the spread prod ucts, we've been putting our financing and securitization business as part of our \\nsimplification, fully within Markets, so that we've created a unified, scaled spreads product business. And \\nthen finally, equities, where we're focused on improving our prime  offering, building balances. We still have \\na way to go obviously in that. Prime balances we're pleased they were nicely up this year, driven by client \\nmomentum. And we're a leading equities derivative franchise. So, you do have these four core businesses.  \\n \\nAnd I'd go back to our big point of differentiation and why we feel we're well -positioned. We have a very \\ndifferentiated corporate client base and very strong partnerships between our core Markets franchise, TTS, \\nand  Banking and Securities Services, and that helps us in FX, in commodities and in rates around the world. \\nSo, Markets is important both in terms of its leadership, but also, how it fits into the strengths that we have \\nfrom this simpler Citi  of those five core interconnected businesses.  \\n \\nWe've demonstrated solid returns in the past. I think a lot of the actions we've been taking will help drive \\nreturns in the future. And you should be getting confidence when you see the discipline we're putting on to \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Fourth  Quarter  202 3 Earnings  Call  \\nJanuary 12, 202 4 \\n \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   15 \\n RWA, 5.3%, getting close that target, w e said at Investor Day. We're moving that up to 6%. The exits we've \\ngot of nonstrategic businesses shows our focus on efficiency. And we've also been doing some good \\ninvestments in our technology, and that's getting us into a good place there. So, I think,  don't be concerned \\nabout the shrinking. We're just making sure that it really plays to our strengths and we optimize the returns.  \\n \\nOPERATOR: Our next question will come from Gerard  Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open.  \\n \\nGERARD CASSIDY: Good  afternoon, Mark, Jane. Mark, can you share with us, in your revenue guide, in the \\nnet interest income, I know you mentioned it's going to be lower and part of it is due to lower interest rates. \\nSome of your peers have come out with their guides using the forward curv e in their net interest income \\nforecast which includes the Fed in our country, six cuts. Can you give us some color what kind of rate \\nenvironment , I know you said lower rates, but any insights around that guide?  \\n \\nMARK MASON: Yeah, I think what I'd point yo u to is in the range of the $80 billion to $81 billion, we're \\nassuming three to six cuts, right. You've got a range there and the reason I described it like that is that, if you \\nthink about our IRE, as we've shown it in the Qs before, we're positioned such  that, with 100 basis point \\nmove, parallel shift in rate across the curve, the US dollar impact would only be a couple hundred million \\ndollars, all right, and so , to the negative, obviously , but it's a couple hundred million dollars. And so as we \\nthink about that forecast, and as I mentioned, NII being down a bit, that covers kind of three to six cuts over \\nthe course of 2024, likely back -loaded, but that's what's in there.  \\n \\nGERARD CASSIDY: Very good , I appreciate that. And then, Jane, more of a qua litative question rather than \\nquantitative, but obviously, there's numerous moving parts of the strategies that you guys are executing on, \\nexiting businesses, downsizing  businesses. Especially on the downsizing, I think you guys mentioned, the \\nhead count o f about 20,000 coming down. How do you keep the morale of the organization elevated when \\nyou have these types of tough decisions that you all have to make?  \\n \\nJANE FRASER: Yes. Well, we've also got areas which are growing, so that does help, too. We have a d iversified \\nportfolio here. I think we're very mindful of , that there is a human impact of the decisions that we're making. \\nWe're trying to be as transparent with our people, as we are with our investors about what we need to do, \\nwhy we're doing it, what to  expect and laying that out so people understand the logic behind the decision s, \\nand then they understand what the decisions are as quickly as they can. I think that's the most humane way \\nto do this.  \\n \\nOPERATOR:  Our next question comes from Erika Najarian w ith UBS. Your line is now open.  \\n \\nERIKA NAJARIAN:  Hi. I'm sorry to prolong the call. Thank you for all your color. Just one more question. Jane, \\nwhen will you feel comfortable giving us a buyback outlook that's beyond just fourth quarter? I know you still \\nhave a little bit of ways to go, but you do have 100 basis point buffer to your minimum. And I know Basel III \\nendgame is still out there, and I'm sure that reducing risk just doesn't mean expenses, but also reducing your \\n or being mindful of your RWA footp rint. And given where your stock is relative to book, when will you be \\nmore comfortable about giving sort of a longer -term outlook that was underpinning your RoTCE target with \\nregards to the buyback?  \\n \\nJANE FRASER:  Erika, it's a great question. It's one I a sk myself every morning when I get up, because given \\nwhere we trade, the value for our shareholders of buybacks is enormous. And Mark and I are very committed \\nto doing so. We also know that we're building our credibility. And I don't want to say things tha t we're not \\ngoing to deliver against, although we're going to have to change. I think it's one of the values that we're really \\ntrying to adhere to very strongly.  \\n \\nAnd with the NP R, I think we'll get a better sense about this soon. The comment period just g ot extended, \\nand we want to see what that is. I think you've all heard us at the Senate banking hearings with our concerns \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Fourth  Quarter  202 3 Earnings  Call  \\nJanuary 12, 202 4 \\n \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   16 \\n about it. I very much hope that it is either completely revised or very materially, so it doesn't have a negative \\nimpact on the econo my and the US banking system competitiveness , the move for more business  to the \\nshadow banks, which I think has got to a point, which is not healthy. So, we're going to wait and see where \\nthat comes out before we give it to you, but I would be asking exact ly the same question in your shoes as \\nwell . \\n \\nERIKA NAJARIAN: Thank you, Jane. I think that it was very helpful that you said on this public forum where \\nyou're trying to build credibility, because as I think about what long -only investors have been dying to  see \\nfrom Citi in terms of the previous leadership was that sort of awareness. And I think just having that \\nawareness recognition will be very important to investors, so thank you.  \\n \\nJANE FRASER : Thank you.  \\n \\nOPERATOR:  Our next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.  \\n \\nHi. I want to follow up on the Russian exposure on page 34. It looks like you guys have \\ntaken a really good whack on the net investment. And you also highlighted how the CTA would be capital -\\nneutral, even if you did have to write that down. But what about the remaining exposure? And just like how \\nprime \\n  are you responsible for some of these unremittable corporate derivatives? I think a lot of us don't \\nunderstand that type of exposure.  And is there risk to you going forward, or could you hopefully clear it back \\nfrom the outside exposure going forward?  \\n \\nJANE FRASER:  Yeah, actually, I also want to kind of take a bigger picture answer to that before I turn it to \\nMark. Because I would have thought that's a question that is on everybody's minds, particularly given the \\nfirm's overall low level of returns and our headline numbers this quarter about what we've been doing with \\nRussia and Argentina, the sort of bigger strategic question behind it,  and then we'll get to your specifics on \\nthe Russia front.  \\n \\nIf you think about Citi, we have a differentiated global business model, and that means we're committed to \\nthe countries in which our multinational clients operate over the long run. So, that mean s we hold long -term \\ncapital in those countries, upon which we generate solid returns through the cycle. And let me just point to \\nour leading Services and FX businesses are the heart of that network, and they're generating double -digits, \\nas you can see.  \\n \\nWith that footprint  comes a set of risks. So, I think of it in terms of credit, currency, transferability of capital. \\nAnd we've proven our ability to manage those risks consistently over a long period of time.  And with respect \\nto the Q4 currency and transfe r items, while the timing was unknown and we've highlighted those risks in \\nour disclosures for a couple of years, I'd say, Russia is rather unique. It's a war, and for us, a highly unusual \\nliquidation. We've navigated it very well. We've executed our wind -down in an orderly way with very low \\nlosses for our clients and very low losses for us. Our remaining net assets are now 100% reserved again st. \\n \\nAnd I think similarly, if I just touch on Argentina for a minute, because I'm sure, folks  have got a few questi ons \\non that. Similarly, over the last several years, we've de -risked our business model there. We don't have a \\nconsumer bank, so we've really reduced down our emerging markets exposures to just our institutional \\npresence, focused on the multinational clien ts, you've heard us talk about that, and select high -grade local \\nclients.  \\n \\nIf you look at Argentina, it's a very good business for us over the cycle. And even after the impacts of Q4, we \\nhad less than $5 million in credit losses in Argentina over a 10 -year  period. That's remarkable, $5 million over \\n10 years. In terms of the currency risk, we all have to book revenues, the official rate versus the parallel market \\nrate. We are able to partially but not fully hedge the exposure, but we would certainly always t ake economic \\ndecisions on the business we do and did mindful of likely devaluations and capital controls. And the reserve \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Fourth  Quarter  202 3 Earnings  Call  \\nJanuary 12, 202 4 \\n \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   17 \\n is a reserve. It centers on the ability to convert and transfer capital as per US banking laws , so I just want to \\nput part of things a t this quarter into that context.  \\n \\nWe have a global business model. It's heavily focused on high -grade multinational clients. Our track record \\nfor managing the various risks associated with our global network has been very strong. And I think you're \\nseeing  us with a very conservative and reserved profile. Mark, what would you add?  \\n \\nMARK MASON: Yeah, very quickly on the Russia point. As you know and as the slide points out, we've \\ncontinued to bring our exposure down there. It's down to $6.5 billion , it's dow n 13% from the previous year \\nand a  third from 2021. We've brought down the consumer loans, the consumer deposits in a significant way \\nthere. And essentially, what's left is that we have a custody business and we're holding corporate dividends \\nthat are our clients' proceeds we\\n re unable to pay those out by law, by regulation, and so we have to hold \\nthose and so that's what's being referenced in the slide when we say unremittable Russia corporate \\ndividends. And so, that is not a risk of loss for us, but we're  unable to kind of clear those because of the state \\nof play in Russia at this stage.  \\n \\nOkay , that was clear. And then, just separately in credit cards. You and a lot of your peers \\nexpect losses to go up from here, but most of you are saying, they're going to peak at this year, including you. \\nJust what gives you confidence that the card losses will peak this year is it just getting back to that a little bit \\nof a normalized level? Is it some tightening that you've done? What's driving that confidence, looking out this \\nyear? Because you're probably seeing a step -up coming still, right?  \\n \\nMARK MASON:  Sur e ,there's a step -up coming. We gave a forecast on 202 4 (sic) , as you point out, to what \\nthe full -year estimate for NCLs will be for both Branded and for Retail Services. What I'd point out is, you can \\nsee actually on the slide how there was a dip in loss rates during the COVID period. And so to some extent, \\nwhat we're seeing is kind of a catch up of those, as those portfolios go through a longer maturation than what \\nyou'd normally see in a cards portfolio.  \\n \\nOn top of that, we've been originating new card. You've noticed our acquisitions have grown, so we obviously \\nhave new card loans, and those are going through a much normal maturation period. And so, as we look at \\nthe early buckets and the delinquencies that are playing out, we've got a pretty good sense for when we \\nwould expect those to peak and at what level. And we think they'll peak inside of 2024, so that's captured in \\nthat average forecast that we've given.  \\n \\nWe haven't made material changes to our underwriting. However, there is mix evolution that ha ppens. \\nTransactors, we have a number of transactors that have kind of come on to our portfolio and are in the mix \\nof our  Branded portfolio as well. So, anyway, those are the drivers that give us confidence and inform the \\ntrajectory that we're talking about  here.  \\n \\nOPERATOR:  Our next question will come from Ryan Kenny with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.  \\n \\nRYAN KENNY: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So, I have a question on quantitative tightening. \\nWondering if you have any early thoughts on how Citi's positioned if the Fed ends Q T early? Is that a material \\ncatalyst for you, and would that help you hit your revenue targets even sooner?  \\n \\nMARK MASON: Yeah. Again, I mean, when I think about our interest rate exposure, and for US dollar in \\nparticular,  we showed it in our last Q, we'll show it in this Q. For a 100 basis point move in a parallel shift, \\nwe're looking at probably a negative $1.6 billion or so, but important to point out that the US dollar \\ncomponent of that is only a couple hundred million dollars. Similarly, if rates moved in the other way, positive \\nof 100 basis points, there'd be a small movement as it relates to US dollar exposure. So our US dollar \\nexposure is relatively neutral, again, assuming a static balance sheet, a parallel shift in  the curve. And so, \\nwe're kind of neutral relative to rates moving in either direction and, therefore, the impact there.  \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Fourth  Quarter  202 3 Earnings  Call  \\nJanuary 12, 202 4 \\n \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   18 \\n  \\nRYAN KENNY: Then, there's a lot of optimism and debate around capital markets rebound. Are you seeing \\nthat? And can you help update us on Investment Banking pipeline across M&A, ECM, DCM?  \\n \\nJANE FRASER: Yes. We certainly had a much more constructive market environment to the end of 2023. \\nInterest rate spreads and volatility at lows for the year. Equity prices are high. And I thin k we view this as a \\nhelpful foundation for activity to accelerate in 2024, assuming the tailwinds persist. And speaking of our \\nown pipeline, the breadth, the depth, the quality of it's very sound. It's higher than it was pre -COVID. So \\nwhen markets are cons tructive, we expect to move these opportunities forward. And we're hearing a lot more \\nconfidence from the CEOs, CFOs around this.  \\n \\nAnd yeah, we're looking at our own side. As you know, we've been investing in some higher -growth areas, so \\nwe get a good bala nce between our traditionally strong sectors as well as high -growth areas. And we've been \\nseeing some very good momentum in healthcare and technology, as well as areas of traditional strength, \\nwhich is energy and industrial. And I think we feel very confid ent in the recovery in DCM. The beginnings of \\none in LevFin . And so, cautiously optimistic here. So I wouldn't say that it's going to accelerate enormously \\nand with incredible speed, but I think we're feeling much better about the foundation.  Mark, anythin g you'd \\nadd?  \\n \\nMARK MASON: I completely agree.  \\n \\nOPERATOR: Our next question comes from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.  Your line is now open.  \\n \\nSCOTT SIEFERS: Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. Have you all assumed any \\nrevenue attr ition just related to the reduction in force? And I guess just broadly, how might that be embedded \\nin the 2024 revenue guidance? And I guess just at a top level, maybe just a shot or two on...  \\n \\nJANE FRASER: Sorry , Scott, I didn't hear what it was. I think the phone line cut out. The revenue attrition?  \\n \\nSCOTT SIEFERS:  I'm sorry. Yeah, just curious if you have assumed any revenue attrition related to the \\nreduction in force over the coming year.  \\n \\nJANE FRASER: Okay , no, no we haven't. I think a lot of the moves that we've made from the organization \\nsimplification, so the 5,000 or so roles we talked about, they're mainly managerial roles. And they've mainly \\nimpacted the functions and the geographies, not nearly so much the revenue from revenue generators.  \\n \\nAnd the other piece is with the client organization, we're actually putting much more time into the hands of \\nour people to drive revenue forward, so I think what we're looking at here is getting rid of areas of bureaucracy \\nand where we've been too complicat ed, where we can drive efficiency whilst preserving our frontline and \\nencouraging them to be as revenue -productive and delivering the full force of the firm to the client. So I like \\nto see the opposite actually.  \\n \\nSCOTT SIEFERS: Okay , pe rfect , thank you. An d then, Mark, can you discuss for a second maybe, just broadly, \\nthe flow of expenses through the year? I know that they should begin to decline towards the end, but what \\nhappens between now and then? Do they hold kind of flattish with a core rate, or would  there be any normal \\ncourse of business growth?  \\n \\nMARK MASON:  I think what I'd say is that, you should expect it in the first quarter. We'd likely see an uptick \\nin our total expenses relative to the fourth, in part because, as Jane has mentioned, we anticip ate that there'll \\nbe more to the org  simplification and, therefore, dollars associated with that in Q1. And then, from there, I \\nwould expect that you see a downward trend through the fourth quarter.  \\n \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Fourth  Quarter  202 3 Earnings  Call  \\nJanuary 12, 202 4 \\n \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   19 \\n SCOTT SIEFERS: Perfect. All right. Thank you.  \\n \\nOPERATOR:  Our next question will come from Vivek Juneja with JP  Morgan. Your line is now open.  \\n \\nVIVEK JUNEJA: Hi Jane, hi Mark.  Couple of quick clarifications. On your NII guide, you talked about you're \\nassuming three to six cuts. That's US, I presume , so are you assuming flat , unchanged rates outside the US \\nsince you have more sensitivity outside?  \\n \\nMARK MASON:  Modest declines outside, but yes declines outside as well, but not nearly of the magnitude \\nof what we're talking about in the US.  \\n \\nVIVEK JUNEJA:  Okay. A nd then, Jane, to your point about the 20,000 head count cuts and I heard you just \\nmentioned 5,000 from managerial positions, where are the rest 15,000 coming there?  \\n \\nJANE FRASER:  So let me just be clear about where the ones that we've just done and that w e're working on \\nthrough the organization simplification. So when I think about that effort, it will close at the end of the first \\nquarter, as we said. We're expecting to get about $1 billion of run rate save from the org simplification work \\nalone. That con stitutes about 5,000 heads. We're just about to, at the end of this month, finish Phase 3, \\nwhich will mean the first four layers of the organization have been addressed. That's been a net reduction of \\nabout 1,500 managers out of a total of 12,000 roles. Th ere's about 13%, and these are mainly manager roles, \\nas I talked about earlier.  \\n  \\nThen, when we think about where are other expense opportunities on top of this, as Mark was talking about \\nearlier, the stranded costs, we'll be completing the elimination of the stranded costs from the divestitures. \\nWe'll be continuing, and you've seen us \\n  been continuing that, exiting marginal businesses and hobbies and \\nthe like and being very disciplined about that.  \\n \\nWe've got some businesses where we feel we need to right size the core expense base. Andy Sieg is going to \\nbe kicking off that in Wealth, and you'll begin to see some of the impact of that in the first quarter. He's off to \\na strong start. And then, we've got others where we'll be creating more utilities. We've s till got different \\nfragmented activities across the firm that the organization simplification has highlighted. We'll be \\naggregating those, creating utilities, or are consolidating some of those different functions. And that is \\nbefore we get to , beginning t o get benefits from the transformation, where there'll be efficiencies that come \\nthrough.  \\n \\nWe'll still have areas that we're investing. These are going to be, as we talked about, core business \\ninvestments. It's going to be expense growth still in the top, from volume growth that we've got. And we will \\nbe investing in our transformation. And all of this is happening over the medium term to get us to the 11% to \\n12% RoTCE target we talked about.  \\n \\nSo that 20,000, it's the number that we estimate of the headcount. I don't love thinking headcount. I like \\nthinking about expenses. I think it's a more mea ningful number. So as Mark laid out in his presentation, we've \\ngot a net expense save that we're expecting to achieve from the medium term. And these are the raft of \\ndifferent areas that will be contributing to it, and we're working hard at it.  \\n \\nOPERATOR:  Our next question will come from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.  \\n \\nSTEVEN CHUBAK:  Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Really just some ticky -tack modeling questions on \\nthe revenue side. Does the revenue guidance for the full year i nclude any reduction in credit card late fees? \\nAnd how large of a contributor is that to revenues overall at Cit igroup ? \\n \\nMARK MASON:  So, let's see , so obviously, the proposal  is out there and we've factored in what's knowable \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Fourth  Quarter  202 3 Earnings  Call  \\nJanuary 12, 202 4 \\n \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 4 Citigroup Inc.   20 \\n as it relates to that. We haven't given guidance externally on what that impact is, but we do believe there are \\noffsets and mitigants that, over time, we'll be able to kind of bring into play. And so, a lon g-winded way of \\nsaying our revenue forecast does assume some basic level of late fee adjustment.  \\n \\nSTEVEN CHUBAK: Got it. And just on the earlier comments you made, Mark, around Services NII. I am \\nstruggling to reconcile the 50/50 NII contribution from rate  and volume components, just given average loan \\nto deposits were essentially flat year -on-year, NII grew $3 billion. It does imply a much larger contribution \\nfrom rates. I know there's deposit funds transfer pricing and other noise. So I was hoping maybe y ou could \\nunpack that a little bit further.  \\n \\nMARK MASON: I mean, there are a lot of factors in there. There's obviously, as well, the mix as it relates to \\nwhat we have in the US versus outside of the US, so there are a number of factors there and probably t oo \\nmuch to kind of take you through on the call here. But we're happy to kind of follow up with you offline and \\ntake you through it.  \\n \\nOPERATOR:  Our final question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.  \\n \\nMIKE MAYO: Yeah, just a clarif ication. When you said medium term on this call as it relates to employee \\nreductions, expense savings, revenue targets, and 11% to 12% RoTCE , does medium term mean by 2026 or \\ndoes it mean something different?  \\n \\nMARK MASON : Yeah.  \\n \\nJANE FRASER:  2026.  By 2026.  Thank you, Mike.  \\n \\nOPERATOR: There are no further questions. I will turn the call over to Jenn Landis for closing remarks.  \\n \\nJENNIFER LANDIS : Thank you, everyone, for joining the call. If you have any follow -up questions, please \\ncontact IR.

I'd like to remind \\nyou that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain \\nforward -looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to \\nuncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due \\nto a variety of factors, including those described in our earnings materials as well as i n our SEC filings.  \\n \\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Jane.  \\n \\nJANE FRASER : Thank you, Jenn, and good morning to everyone.  I shall touch briefly on the macro \\nenvironment before reviewing the quarter and last month's organization announcement.   \\n \\nThe global macro backdrop remains a story of de -synchronization. In the U.S., recent data implies a soft \\nlanding, but history would suggest otherwise.   And we are seeing cracks in the lower FICO consumers.  \\n \\nIn the Euro -area and the UK, the picture has turned distinctly more negative. The summer weakness in \\nindustrial economies is spreading south.  And the weight of structurally higher labor and energy costs \\nsuggest a more enduring competitiveness challenge for that region.  \\n \\nefforts, but it still has to work through weak sentiment, youth unemployment and the pain in its property \\nmarket.  \\n \\nAll of these macro dynamics have clearly impacted client sentiment.  \\n \\nSeptember  is always a busy month seeing clients, and I am struck how consistently CEOs are less optimistic \\nabout 2024 than a few months ago. The shift in the rates question from how high to how long has catalyzed \\nmore client activity, however.  Corporates have stop ped waiting for rates to come down and are beginning \\nto access the debt capital markets around the globe.    \\n \\nOur multinational clients are adapting their operations to the evolving geopolitical landscape and building \\nredundancy and resiliency.  This plays to our strengths and strategy, in particular our invaluable global \\nnetwork. And between our high -quality asse t portfolio, strong reserve levels, ample liquidity and diversified \\nearnings base, we are proving to our clients that we truly are a bank for all seasons.  \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Third  Quarter  202 3 Earnings  Call  \\nOctober 13 , 2023   \\n \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 3 Citigroup Inc.   2 \\n  \\nTurning to the quarter, today we reported net income of $3.5 billion, an EPS of $1.63 and an ROTCE of 7.7%. \\nOur revenues were up 10% ex -divestitures and each of our five core, interconnected businesses posted \\nrevenue growth.   We remain on track to meet the revenue and expense guidance we set for the year.  \\n \\n \\nrevenue quarter in over a decade and it continues to outpace the target we set at Investor Day. Half of that \\ngrowth was business drivers and the other half rates.  Even with impact of the long -expected Argentine \\ndevaluation, we again drove fee growth, which is the best sign of the potential of our globally leading \\nfranchise.  \\n \\nWe keep relentlessly innovating for our clients. Amongst other launches, this quarter we announced the \\ncreation of Citi To ken Services, which will use distributed ledger and smart contract technologies to deliver \\na digital asset solution for our TTS clients. This is a first for the industry as it allows us to seamlessly \\nintegrate a permissioned tokenized bank deposit network with traditional cash services such as 24/7 dollar \\nclearing.    \\n \\nSecurities Services had revenue growth of 16%, with some good underlying fee growth.  We took share again \\nand we have grown our AUC/AUA by over $2 trillion in the last year.  This business ha s considerable \\nmomentum and a strong pipeline of clients who are benefitting from the cloud and data investments we \\nare making.  \\n \\nMarkets was up 10% year -over -year on the back of Rates & Currencies having the best third quarter in 10 \\nyears and Commodities grew nicely.  This was partially offset by Equities which was down slightly.  Despite \\nthis we continue to see good momentum in cash and we have grown prime balances year to date.  \\n \\nBanking had a good quarter with revenues up 17%, with activity playing to ou r mix.  While corporate lending \\nwas essentially flat, as we remain very disciplined about how we use our balance sheet, DCM was healthier \\nand the IPO market also showed some signs of life.   This helped drive Investment Banking revenue up 34%, \\nalbeit off o f a low base and a small wallet. Sitting here today, it remains hard to predict when deal activity \\nwill sustainably rebound.  Still, I am proud of our role advising on some of the biggest deals globally so far \\nthis year.  \\n \\nAs you know, we are committed to g rowing our Banking franchise. We have brought together the \\nmanagement of the Investment, Corporate, and Commercial Bank under one umbrella and this structure \\nwill help us better drive the important synergies between them.  We have been bringing in new tale nt in key \\nsectors and we have begun to provide more leveraged finance for key clients in the right situations.  \\n \\nU.S. Personal Banking was also up double -digits, at 13%.  Cards revenues were strong in both our Branded \\nand Retail Services portfolios.  The gr owth in spending is decelerating and the consumer is more mindful \\nwhat they spend on. Indeed the affluent, who still have excess savings at their disposal, drove the growth \\nin spending, with a continued tilt to travel and entertainment.  \\n \\nDuring the quarter\\nBanking clients. We believe that by tiering offerings and simplifying our fee structure, we will  incentivize our \\nclients to deepen their relationships with us. The early r eaction from clients along those lines has been very \\npositive.  \\n \\nWealth revenues have stabilized and were up slightly.  Most notably Investment revenues picked up across \\nour geographies.   The drivers for the franchise - such as referrals, client acquisiti on, and net new inflows - \\nwere all quite strong around the world.  And we won important new mandates for Wealth at Work, an \\noffering we had highlighted at Investor Day.  \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Third  Quarter  202 3 Earnings  Call  \\nOctober 13 , 2023   \\n \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 3 Citigroup Inc.   3 \\n  \\nAndy Sieg has now officially joined our firm.  This is a time of massive global wealt h creation - and our \\nthe world.  \\n \\nIn terms of our balance sheet, our discipline of growing operating deposits has enabled us to maintain a \\nstable d eposit base over the past five years. We grew loans during the quarter and our credit quality remains \\nextremely strong, aided by our disciplined client selection.  \\n \\nOur CET1 ratio grew to 13.5% which is $14 billion above our regulatory minimum and still in cludes a 100bps \\ninternal management buffer. During the quarter, we returned $1.5 billion to our shareholders through \\ncommon dividends and stock buybacks.    \\n \\nWe continue to evaluate buybacks quarter -by-quarter and I expect we will continue to do a modest level in \\nthe fourth quarter, subject to approval by our Board.   And while the ultimate impact of potentially higher \\nthrough mitigating actio ns. \\n  \\nAs you can see on slide 3, we are relentless in executing our strategy. This quarter we closed on the sale of \\nour Taiwan consumer business, the second largest of the Asia consumer divestitures. And earlier this week, \\nwe announced that we will sell ou r consumer wealth portfolio in China to HSBC.  This includes \\napproximately $2.6 billion of assets under management and $1 billion of deposits.  \\n \\nIn the fourth quarter, we expect to close on the sale of our Indonesia consumer business. In terms of the \\ninternational consumer businesses we are exiting, in addition to the three wind -down markets, we have \\nrestarted the sales process in Poland,  and we re main on track to separate Mexico next year, followed by an \\nIPO in 2025.  \\n \\nTransformation remains our number one priority.  We are deep into the large body of work of automating \\nmanual controls and processes, consolidating fragmented tech platforms,  and upgr ading our data \\narchitecture.  We are committed to doing this the right way, knowing that it will take time to meet our \\nregulators expectations and to deliver a modern, more efficient infrastructure.  \\n \\nLast month we announced consequential changes that align  our organizational structure with our strategy \\nand changes how we run the bank.   I said at Investor Day that organizational simplification would follow \\nthe divestitures.  The changes will eliminate layers, duplication, and complexity allowing us to opera te the \\nbank more agilely and freeing our people up to focus on clients and execution.   \\n \\nElevating the five core businesses to my leadership team will enable me to drive greater accountability and \\nsustainable results.  To bring it alive, the actions we hav e taken in the last four weeks will eliminate over \\n15% of the regional and functional roles at the top two layers, and 60 committees, freeing up over tens of \\nthousands of people hours annually.  We have identified about 1,000, or 50%, of our internal finan cial \\n-heads and dual reporting lines \\nto enable faster decision -making.  \\n \\nWe are cascading these changes through the organization at pace. We announced the first two layers in \\nSeptember an d the next set of changes will be implemented by mid -November, and we aim to bring the \\nentire process to a close by early next year.  \\n \\nWhen we speak in January, Mark and I will be in a position to update you on the financial and other metrics \\nshowing the i mpact of the simplification, amongst other details.  While expense is not the primary driver of \\nthe organizational changes, they will help us start bending the expense curve in the fourth quarter of next \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Third  Quarter  202 3 Earnings  Call  \\nOctober 13 , 2023   \\n \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 3 Citigroup Inc.   4 \\n year.  And at the end of the work, we will have a si mpler firm, that can operate faster, better serve our clients \\nand unlock value for our shareholders.  \\n \\nWe have made tough decisions here.  I want to note how pleased I have been with how the leaders of the \\nfirm, especially the next generation, have embraced  these changes and are stepping up to implement them. \\nThey fully understand that we need to change how we run Citi in order to truly transform it once and for all.  \\n \\nBefore I close, I would like to address our people in Israel.  We are a significant bank in  the country and many \\nof our people have lost friends and loved ones.  Others are being called up to serve.  Despite all that they are \\ndealing with, they are keeping our bank running in the country.   I am frankly in awe of their commitment to \\nour clients and each other.  More broadly, the price innocent civilians are paying as this crisis unfolds is \\nabsolutely devastating to witness.  \\n \\nWith that, I would like to turn it over to Mark and then we would be delighted, as always, to take your \\nquestions.  \\n \\nMARK MA SON : Thanks, Jane and good morning,  everyone.  I am going to start with the Firmwide financial \\nresults, focusing on year -over -year comparisons for the third quarter unless I indicate otherwise, and then \\nspend a little more time on the businesses.  \\n \\nOn slid e 4, we show financial results for the full firm.  In the third quarter, we reported net income of \\napproximately $3.5 billion, EPS of $1.63 and an RoTCE of 7.7% on $20.1 billion of revenues.  \\nEmbedded in these results are divestiture -related impacts of approximately $214 million, after -tax, \\nprimarily driven by the Taiwan consumer business sale. Excluding these items, EPS was $1.52 with an \\nRoTCE of 7.2%.  \\n \\nIn the quarter, total revenues increased  by 9% on a reported basis and 10% excluding divestiture -related \\nimpacts, driven by strength across Services, Cards and Markets, as well as modest growth in Banking, \\npartially offset by the revenue reduction from the closed exits and wind -downs.  \\n \\nOur resul ts include expenses of $13.5 billion, up 6% on a reported basis and $13.4 billion excluding \\ndivesture -related costs, also up 6%.  Cost of credit was approximately $1.8 billion, up 35%, primarily driven \\nby the continued normalization in Card net credit losse s and volume growth.  At the end of the quarter, we \\nhad over $20 billion in total reserves with a reserve -to-funded loans ratio of approximately 2.7%.  And year -\\nto-date, we reported an RoTCE of 8.3%.  \\n \\nOn slide 5, we show expense drivers for the third quarter as well as our key investment themes.  \\nExpenses were up 6% and our level of expenses continue to be driven by a number of factors, including:  \\nInvestments in Transformation as well as risk and controls , Business -led and enterprise -led investments  \\nMacro factors, including inflation and FX , Severance, which was approximately $190 million in the quarter \\nand roughly $640 million on a year -to-date basis.  This included actions across Banking, Markets, Wealth \\nand the functions.  And all of this was partiall y offset by productivity savings and expense reductions from \\nthe closed exits and wind -downs . \\n \\nAnd our technology spend across the firm was $3 billion in the quarter, up 8%, largely driven by investments \\nin product development, platform enhancements and im proving the client experience.  Also driving the \\nincrease is continued investment in technology for the Transformation as we address the consent orders \\nand modernize the firm.  \\n \\nAs we said last quarter, our Transformation and technology investments span the  following themes:  \\nPlatform and process simplification , Security and infrastructure modernization , Client experience \\nenhancements , and data improvements . And we remain in line with our full year guidance of roughly $54 \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Third  Quarter  202 3 Earnings  Call  \\nOctober 13 , 2023   \\n \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 3 Citigroup Inc.   5 \\n billion, excluding divestiture -relat ed impacts and the FDIC special assessment.   \\n \\n In the \\nthird quarter, net interest income decreased by $72 million.  Excluding Markets, net interest income \\nincreased $332 million, primarily driven by:  Growth in PBWM, as we continue to see loan growth and higher \\nloan spreads , a pickup in Services driven by higher deposit spreads, as a result of higher interest rates and \\nactive beta management , partially offset  by reductions from closed exits and wind -downs . Average loans \\nwere up 1%, largely driven by growth in U.S. Personal Banking across Cards and Retail Banking, as well as \\nTTS.  Average deposits were down 2%, largely driven by Services, as we saw non -operation al deposit \\noutflows, as expected, in light of quantitative tightening.  And our net interest margin increased 1 basis \\npoint.  \\n  \\nOn slide 7, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics.  We are well reserved for the current \\nenvironment with over $20 bill ion of total reserves.  Our reserves -to-funded loans ratio is nearly 2.7%. And \\nwithin that, U.S. Cards is 7.8%.  In PBWM, 45% of our loans are in US cards and of that exposure, 80% is to \\nconsumers with FICO scores of 680 or higher.  And both Branded Cards and Retail Services NCL rates are \\nstill below pre -COVID levels but are normalizing in line with our expectations.  The remaining 55% of our \\nPBWM loans are largely in Wealth, predominantly in mortgages and margin lending.  \\n \\nIn our ICG portfolio, of our total exposure, approximately 85% is investment grade. Of the international \\nexposure, approximately 90% is investment grade or exposure to multinational clients or their subsidiaries.  \\nCorporate non -accrual loans increased by $490 million but remain low at 68 bas is points of total corporate \\nloans. And we ended the quarter with a reserve -to-funded loan ratio of approximately 1%.  As you can see \\non the page, we break out our Commercial Real Estate lending exposures across ICG and PBWM which \\ntotals approximately $65 b illion, of which 86% is investment grade with a total reserve to funded loan ratio \\nof 1.4%. To give you a sense of the macro scenarios that underpin our over $20 billion of reserves, our \\ncurrent scenario -weighted average unemployment rate is approximately 5%, which includes a downside \\nscenario with an average unemployment rate of roughly 7%.     \\n \\nSo, while the macro and geopolitical environment remains uncertain, we feel very good about our asset \\nquality, exposures and reserve levels\\n and we continuously rev iew and stress the portfolio under a range \\nof scenarios.   \\n \\nOn slide 8, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics.  We maintain a very \\nstrong $2.4 trillion balance sheet which is funded in part by a well -diversified $1.3 trillio n deposit base \\nacross regions, industries, customers and account types which is deployed into high -quality, diversified \\nassets.  Our balance sheet reflects our strategy and well diversified business model.  We leverage our unique \\nassets and capabilities to  serve corporates, financial institutions, investors, and individuals with global \\nneeds.  The majority of  our deposits, $782 billion, are institutional and operational in nature and span \\nacross 90 countries.  These institutional deposits are complemented by $416 billion of U.S. Personal \\nBanking and global wealth deposits.  \\n \\nWe have approximately $569 billion of  HQLA and approximately $666 billion of loans and we maintain \\ntotal liquidity resources of $937 billion.  Our LCR was 117%.  We ended the quarter with a 13.5% CET1 ratio, \\nbased on Standardized RWA, which is our binding constraint.  Although not binding, our A dvanced RWA did \\nincrease this quarter, largely driven by business activity.  And our tangible book value per share was $86.90, \\nup 8% from a year ago.  \\n \\nOn slide 9, we show a sequential CET1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter. Starting from \\nthe end of the second quarter . First, we generated $3.2 billion of net income to common which added 28 \\nbasis points . Second, we returned $1.5 billion in the form of common dividends and share repurchases, \\nwhich drove a reduction of about 13 b asis points , and finally, the remaining 2 basis point increase was \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Third  Quarter  202 3 Earnings  Call  \\nOctober 13 , 2023   \\n \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 3 Citigroup Inc.   6 \\n primarily driven by lower DTA deductions and a net reduction in RWA . \\n \\nWe ended the quarter with a 13.5% CET1 capital ratio, approximately 120 basis points or $14 billion above \\nour current r\\na minute on capital.  We continue to optimize our RWA and capital which we expect to be a tailwind over \\ntime.  Contributing to this, is the execution of our strat egy, such as further diversifying our business mix and  \\nsimplifying our business model including exiting our 14 international consumer markets.  Our investments \\nin the Transformation will continue to enhance our data, analytics and stress testing capabiliti es enabling \\ncontinued capital optimization.  And of course, in light of the evolving regulatory environment we are also \\nlooking at other mitigating actions but those will largely depend on how the final capital rules play out.   \\nThese actions could include exiting or restructuring certain products, divesting certain equity investments, \\nand reevaluating both how we deploy capital and our management buffer.  \\ndemonstrated our ability to manage our RWA and capital levels through various macro e nvironments and \\nthe evolving regulatory landscape and will continue to do so.  \\n  \\nOn slide 10, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group for the third quarter.  Revenues were up \\n12% this quarter, driven by double -digit growth across Services, Ma rkets and Banking.  In the quarter, \\nnormal course foreign currency translation impacts drove a net revenue headwind in ICG.  On an ex -FX \\nbasis, ICG revenues would have been up 15%. Additionally, there was an approximately $180 million \\nnegative impact from t he currency devaluation in Argentina on our net investment in the country mainly \\nacross TTS, Markets and Securities Services.  Expenses increased 10%, primarily driven by continued \\ninvestments in risk and controls and volume -related expenses, partially off set by productivity savings.  \\nCost of credit was $196 million, including $51 million of net credit losses.  This resulted in net income of \\napproximately $2.4 billion, up 12%, driven by higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses and higher \\ncost of c redit.  Average loans were down 4%, as we were very deliberate about how we deployed resources \\nacross the businesses, including the reduction in subscription credit facilities.  Average deposits were flat \\nas new client acquisitions and deepening of relation ships with existing clients were offset by non -\\noperational deposit outflows.  ICG delivered an RoTCE of 10% for the quarter and 11% year -to-date.  \\n  \\nOn slide 11, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day.  In \\nTreasury and Trade Solutions, we recorded our highest revenue quarter in the last decade. Revenues were \\nup 12%, driven by 17% growth in net interest income. Non -interest revenues were up 1%, and on an ex -FX \\nbasis, non -interest revenues would have been up 8%.  We continue to see healthy underlying drivers in TTS \\nthat indicate consistently strong client activity with  Cross -border flows up 16%, outpacing global GDP \\ngrowth. And year -to-date, cross -border flows are up 12%  U.S. Dollar Clearing Volumes are up 6%, both  \\nyear -over -year in the quarter and year -to-date and commercial card volumes are up 8% year -over -year, \\ndriven by growth in business -to-business payments and travel and entertainment spend. And year -to-\\ndate commercial card volumes are up 20% . \\n \\nIn fact, simil ar to the last few quarters, client wins are up approximately 40% across all client segments.  \\n We \\ncontinued to make good progress on our commercial client strateg y, as year -to-date wins more than \\ndoubled, driven by expansion into new markets, and growth in multi -product mandates from clients with \\ncross border needs.  In Securities Services, revenues were up 16%, driven by higher net interest income \\nacross currencies.  Non -interest revenues were up 3%.  We are very pleased with the progress we are seeing \\nin Securities Services as we continue to onboard assets under custody and administration, which are up \\napproximately 10% or $2.1 trillion Markets revenues we re up 10%, driven by Fixed Income.  Fixed Income \\nrevenues were up 14%, largely driven by strength in our Rates and Currencies franchise.  While volatility \\nremained subdued versus a year ago, we did see overall volatility tick higher relative to the beginnin g of the \\nquarter  Equities revenues were down 3%, driven by a decline in Equity Derivatives, partially offset by growth \\nin Cash and Prime . And we continued to make solid progress on our revenue -to-RWA target . And finally, \\nBanking revenues, excluding gains a nd losses on loan hedges, were up 17%, driven by Investment Banking, \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Third  Quarter  202 3 Earnings  Call  \\nOctober 13 , 2023   \\n \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 3 Citigroup Inc.   7 \\n which increased 34% on a reported basis and 12% excluding marks. Here too, we saw a pickup in activity in \\nthe last couple of weeks of the quarter, particularly in DCM but also in M&A as w e closed a few deals earlier \\nthan expected . So overall, while the market environment remains challenging and there is more work to be \\ndone, we are making solid progress against our strategy in these businesses.  \\n  \\nNow turning to slide 12, we show the result s for our Personal Banking & Wealth Management business.  \\nRevenues were up 10%, driven by net interest income growth of 9% and a 20% increase in non -interest \\nrevenue, primarily due to lower partner payments in Retail Services and higher investment product \\nrevenues in Wealth.  Expenses were up 5%, predominantly driven by risk and control investments, and \\nseverance, partially offset by productivity savings.  Cost of credit was $1.5 billion, driven by higher net credit \\nlosses as we continue to see normalization in our card portfolios.  Average loans increased 7% driven by \\ncards, mortgages and installment lending.  Average deposits decreased 2%, largely reflecting our clients \\nputting cash to work in investments on our platform.  And PBWM delivered an RoTCE of 8.8%, and 6.6% on \\na year -to-date basis.   \\n \\nOn slide 13, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics.  This quarter \\nwas our 5th consecutive quarter of double -digit growth in Personal Banking, driven by Cards.  Branded \\nCards revenues  were up 12%, primarily driven by higher net interest income. We continue to see strong \\nunderlying drivers with new account acquisitions up 5%, card spend volumes up 4% and average loans up \\n12%.  Retail Services revenues were up 21%, driven by higher net in terest income and lower partner \\npayments on the heels of higher net credit losses. In the Card portfolios, we continue to see the investments \\nwe have been making as well as lower payment rates contribute to growth in interest -earning balances of \\n15% in Bra nded Cards and 12% in Retail Services. Retail Banking revenues decreased 3%, driven by the \\ntransfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our Wealth business, partially offset by higher \\ndeposit spreads. Wealth revenues were up 2%, driven by highe r investment fees across all regions and \\nsegments, the benefit from relationships transferred from Retail Banking and higher lending revenue. We \\nalso saw strong net new inflows across all regions.  And year -to-date, new client acquisitions were up \\nalmost 30 % in the Private Bank and over 60% in Wealth at Work. Overall, we are pleased with the progress \\nwe are making across these businesses.  \\n \\nOn slide 14, we show results for Legacy Franchises.  Revenues were down 13%, largely driven by the \\ndifference in one -tim e gain on sale impacts in the Asia Consumer businesses, as well as the reductions from \\nclosed consumer exits and wind -downs, partially offset by higher revenue in Mexico.  It is worth noting that \\nso appreciation, higher interest rates and \\nvolume growth. Ex -FX, Mexico revenues were up 16%.  Expenses decreased 3%, primarily driven by closed \\nconsumer exits and wind -downs, partially offset by separation costs in Mexico and Mexican peso \\nappreciation. And  expenses in Mexico were up 27%, but ex -FX, expenses were up 11%.  \\n  \\nOn slide 15, we show results for Corporate Other.  Revenues increased, largely driven by the absence of \\nmark -to-market impacts on certain derivative transactions in the prior year.  And exp enses decreased, \\nlargely driven by lower consulting fees.  \\n  \\n With one quarter remaining in the year, we \\ncontinue to expect full -year revenues of $78 - $79 billion, excluding 2023 divestiture -related impacts.  \\nHaving said that, based on what we have seen play out year -to-date in terms of US and non -US rates and \\nlagging non -US betas, we now expect net interest income to be slightly above $47.5 billion for the full year \\nexcluding Markets.  And we are maintaining our expense guidance of roughly $54 billion, excluding 2023 \\ndivestiture -related impacts and the FDIC special assessment.  Net credit losses in Cards should continue \\nto normalize, with both portfolios reaching pre -COVID levels by year -end.  And as  it relates to buybacks, we \\nexpect to do a modest level of buybacks in the fourth quarter.  \\na few points . We are executing on our strategy and delivering top line revenue growth of 5%, year -to-date . \\nWe continue t o invest for the long term with discipline while remaining on track to deliver on our expense \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Third  Quarter  202 3 Earnings  Call  \\nOctober 13 , 2023   \\n \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 3 Citigroup Inc.   8 \\n guidance. We are focused on simplifying our organizational and management structure, which will further \\nsupport our speed of execution. We are managing our capital in a disciplined way in light of regulatory \\nheadwinds, while continuing to optimize and retu rn capital to shareholders. And we remain confident in \\nour ability to achieve our RoTCE target of 11 -12% in the medium term. And again, we look forward to hosting \\na more expansive fourth quarter earnings call where we plan to share additional details relat ed to the \\norganizational simplification, including expected related severance and expense saves, as well as our \\noutlook for 2024. With that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions.  \\n \\nQUESTION AND ANSWER  \\n \\nOPERATOR : And our first question comes from  Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.  \\n \\nMIKE MAYO : Hi. Jane, you spoke more about the restructuring that you commented on recently. The real \\nquestion is, why is this restructuring different than the other 5 or 10 or 15 restructurings we've heard about \\nsince Citi's creation in its current form 25 years ago, I think, just like a week ago? So, I'd say, why is this \\ndifferent? We hear the talk about cascading downward and the simplification, reducing dual heads and the \\ncommittees . But  we've heard this so much that why is this time different?  \\n \\nJANE FRASER : Yeah. It' s a very important question, Mike , thank you for asking it. As I've said, we view these \\nas the most consequential changes we've made , not just to our organization model , but how we run the bank , \\nin almost two decades. And the first piece is simple, which is our org model was set up for a financial \\nsupermarket , that is  simply not the bank we are today. So we  are aligning the organizational model with that \\nsimper business mix and strategy.  \\n \\nBut wha t's truly different is we're changing how we run the bank. And these are permanent changes that will \\nbe driven all the way down through the organization. So let me give you some examples to bring it to life.  We \\ntalked about  delayering the first two  or thre e layers of the bank. That will continue through the organization, \\nthrough the spans and layers, particularly getting rid of aggregator roles. And let me give an example : HR, we \\nhad HR in a region , you had the region head, you had the Institutional Client Group head, you had the Banking \\nhead , in addition, you had a North Asia head and a South Asia head. We're just going to have the North Asia \\nhead and the South Asia head. And all of those roles collapse d into those two.  \\n \\nWe're eliminating activities in the geographies that we just don't need anymore, because we are no longer \\nrunning local consumer franchises in them. So, let's take the financial reporting , sorry, the management \\nreporting that Mark and I referred to in the opening remarks. We can reduce our m anagement reports by \\nabout 50%. That's 1,000 reports. What does that mean? Shadow P&Ls by country, quarterly outlooks, \\nmonthly performance updates, all the associated tracking and reconciliations that are there that are \\neffectively for a shadow P&L, rather  than the one that matters to our shareholders.  And so, that greatly \\ndeclutters.  \\n \\nIt also means we can eliminate processes for our Transformation, where we are looking at how do we \\nautomate those processes, automate those controls. If they're a duplicativ e process, we're getting rid of \\nthem so we don't need to do that anymore and it will accelerate the work on Transformation.  \\n \\nWe are taking activities out of some of the businesses and centralizing them. A lot of the client activities that \\nwill go embedded into a business, we move that up to centralized utilities that the whole firm can benefit \\nfrom and that will get scale economies. These strategy teams, marketing teams, many of the little cottage \\nindustries that build up over time.  \\n  \\nWe can speed up decisi on-making with fewer committee layers. We'll take down the number of layers and \\ndrive that from  some  places 13, we're looking to getting to 8 in as many places as we possibly can. We're \\ngiving clarity of decision rights and changing decision rights from tw o or more people to just one. So much \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Third  Quarter  202 3 Earnings  Call  \\nOctober 13 , 2023   \\n \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 3 Citigroup Inc.   9 \\n more single points of accountability, again more aligned with our shareholder interests, because those \\npoints of accountability are more sitting in the products.  \\n \\nAnd the types of metrics we  are looking at to help us measure this spans  layers, revenue producers and non - \\nproducer s, grade mixes, synergies that we're realizing, voice of the client, but I say that our expectations and \\nour execution of the business strategy is also at the heart of what we're trying to drive  here.  \\n \\nOur strength is our global network. I don't want our geographies focused on the full monty of management \\nprocesses that are a duplication of what's happening in the product organization. I want them focused on \\ndelivering to our clients, engaging wi th our clients and also managing their responsibilities of the legal \\nentities.  \\n \\nThe same way for our Banking organization. Putting the Investment Bank, the Corporate Bank and \\nCommercial Bank together will really make it easier for us to realize the synergi es across them. So, the cross -\\nsell or the movement of a commercial mid -market company up to a corporate lending company and a \\ncorporate banking company, much easier when they're all in the same organization. Or selling our Banking \\nproducts suite into that Commercial Bank customer and other examples.  \\n \\nSo, it's really changing decision -making, freeing up people to focus on clients and Transformation, much \\ngreater transparency, changing decision -making and rights, driving synergies. We put a huge amount of \\nwor k all the way through the summer in design as to how do we want the organization to work. That is now \\ngetting driven down into the designing in detail and in depth all of these types of activities through the \\nsecond and third layers at the moment into the fourth and then until we finish at the end of the first quarter.  \\n \\nSo, it's very different. You'll get more flavor of it in the fourth quarter earnings call, but I hope that gives you \\na sense of why this is really different. This is how we  are running the p lace. It's not just an org restructuring. \\nBoth are necessary.  \\n \\nOPERATOR : And our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.  \\n \\nGLENN SCHORR:  So, I'm curious, you mentioned that you're still marching towards the 11%, 12%, which is \\ngood because everyone was going to ask that. My question is a little bit different of , with the denominator \\ngoing up 25%, in other words, a lot of things are working towards your Transformation, but there's sort of a \\ncurve ball in there with upping the denominator by 25%. So, you seem to be a beneficiary of higher for longer \\nfor sure. And you also mentioned you're working on mitigation as we speak. So, maybe you could talk about \\nwhat are the offsets that we don't see that give you confidence still workin g towards that , because the top \\nline stuff is working ? \\n \\nMARK MASON : So, good morning, Glenn , it's good to hear from you. Let me make a couple comments on \\nthat, and then, Jane, feel free to chime in if you'd like. The first thing is that when I talked about  this at the \\nlast conference we attended, I mentioned that analysts were somewhere in the 16% to 19% range in terms of \\na capital increase, and we're likely to be inside of that range, assuming the Basel III proposal as i\\n s structured, \\nas it's written , and obviously that's not the final , there's a period of review that's going on now.  \\n \\nWhat I'd say is a couple things, Glenn. One, we haven't fully executed against the strategy that Jane has just \\ndescribed. And obviously, continuing to simplify the business, managing through the Transformation, \\nchanging that business mix that we have to something that's more consistent and predictable and \\nrepeatable as it relates to PPNR, those things matter and impact the SCB. We talked about the exiting of the \\ninternational consumer businesses. That will be a factor in what our balance sheet looks like and what stress \\nlosses might look like as well as lowering the expense base, which we know is an important factor in that \\nPPNR math as well. And so, those things help, I think,  to reduce the amount of capital that might be required \\nas we get into that medium -term period.  \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Third  Quarter  202 3 Earnings  Call  \\nOctober 13 , 2023   \\n \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 3 Citigroup Inc.   10 \\n  \\nImportantly, as you point out, there are other elements of the proposal that are going to require that we take \\na hard look at as well and identify mitigating a ctions to the extent that they make it into the final. So, think \\nabout the increase in operational risk and the fact that some of that is already included in SCB as something \\nof a point of advocacy. But that's obviously a big headwind that we'll have to ki nd of work through, the FRTB \\nand the enhancement of models.  Now, there's a global market shock as well, but again another point of \\nadvocacy that we need to work through. The equity investments, and now that they go from 100% risk \\nweighting to 400% risk wei ghting, I think we're going to take a hard look at whether those are worth keeping \\nin light of the higher capital associated with them. That's going to challenge the returns , that's going to force \\nus to look at those through a different strategic lens , and we're going to do that. And that's not to even \\nmention the credit component that impacts both corporates and consumers as it relates to unfunded \\ncommitments, for example.  \\n \\nAnd so, as we've done with SA -CCR and other types of reg changes, we're going to ha ve to look at what it \\nmeans for our product mix, the returns associated with those, whether there are opportunities to pull levers \\nlike pricing, or whether we have to take other decisions around those. And so, that's what I mean by the \\nmitigating actions t hat we're dimensioning and putting on paper and working through, but again, want to be \\nthoughtful because the rule is not final yet, and there are more discussions to be had around those important \\nelements that I mentioned already.  \\n \\nOPERATOR : And our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS.  \\n \\nERIKA NAJARIAN : Good morning. You've talked a lot about defense, as I like to call it, in terms of the \\nTransformation that Jane had outlined and bending the expense curve. But I'm wondering, for both Jane and \\nMark, if you could sort of address what I think is probably the most debated part of your target, which is that \\nrevenue CAGR of 5%. You put up a very nice quarter in terms of revenues, both net interest income and fees. \\nAnd maybe help us sort of look u nderneath the surface in terms of that momentum and maybe break it down \\nin terms of what's really going well. I think TTS continues to surprise to the upside , are we going to be , two \\nyears from now, we\\n re going to be  like, oh, well, TTS is continuing to be  doing well. So, what are the \\nbusinesses that really sort of strong secular momentum that you feel is being under -recognized versus how \\nyou could position cyclically and higher for longer? And what is still to come as we think about that path to \\nat least t he numerator of that RoTCE target?  \\n \\nJANE FRASER : I love this question, Erika, because I have to say I\\n m really excited about our strategy and the  \\npotential it has. And it is, as you say, this is about the revenue potential of the firm and really how do we \\ncontinue to unlock it.  \\n \\nSo, there\\n s a couple of unstoppable trends that we\\n re going to be riding in the next , I think it\\n s decade -long. \\nThe corpor ate client of today , and indeed consumer , has to build resiliency. The multinational client is on a \\nlong -term trend of building resiliency, be it because of green, be it because of geopolitics, be it because of \\nregulatory, whatever the different reasons ma y be, and there are multiple, they're having to build resiliency \\ninto supply chains, into their own operations as they operate around the world . W\\n  the bank that is \\nabsolutely there for them. And I think you've seen that in TTS, where we've had such str ong drivers of growth \\nin the last few years at the beginning of this trend. So, that is an important one.  Wherever the clients want to \\ngo, we are there. We have been there for decades. We understand the risk. We understand the client base. \\nWe understand th e opportunities there , at that. That micro level and local levels that someone who is flying \\nin with a suitcase can't possibly deliver. And it's connected globally.  So, this thing is just a thing of beauty.  \\n \\nLinked into it is what I think of as a hidden g em amongst our crown jewel s is Securities Services. It equally in \\ncustody has this extraordinary global network, the connectivity everywhere. We have been investing behind \\nthis business. We've been growing our market share in North America in asset manager s, where we've been \\nunderweight , with a number of material marquee wins. You can see the share gain that we're getting in this \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Third  Quarter  202 3 Earnings  Call  \\nOctober 13 , 2023   \\n \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 3 Citigroup Inc.   11 \\n business, the pipeline of deals that we've already won as well as the new pipelines going forward. Very high \\nreturn.  We're invest ing both in terms of our cloud, our data, our client experience. And this is in a way, let's \\nsay, I do view this as a hidden gem with extremely attractive return profile, fee profile, and other dimensions \\nto it. We've quite a long way to run here.  So, simi lar story to TTS, slightly different client base, competitively \\nadvantaged because you've got both the pre -trade and the post -trade. We connect the two. Huge \\nefficiencies for clients. That's going to matter.  \\n \\nNext trend that's unstoppable, global wealth cr eation. And there is just going to be massive global wealth \\ncreation. I can't tell you how excited Andy Sieg is now that he's in the building and knows the way to his desk \\nand all the floors his people are on. He's about to hit the road globally. We are so  well positioned to deliver \\nagainst that. And as you can see, we've not been happy with our performance the last couple of years, but \\nthis is going to be a very important driver for us.  \\n  \\nWe'll see the recovery in banking wallet eventually. None of us are calling when that will sustainably happen. \\nThat will be another driver. And I'd say cards continuing to go from strength to strength, particularly I think \\nas we look forward, playing to our lending -led model there.  \\n \\nAnd finally  the other one I do love, which is our Commercial Bank. We serve these entrepreneurs all over the \\nworld, who are going to be the drivers of many industries going forward. And we're serving them, helping \\nthem go international for the first step, tap them in to global supply chains and the like. It's almost by \\ndefinition the fastest growing of the mid -market companies are the ones that tap into what we can offer \\nthem.  We build great relationships with them. And then our private bankers call on them, and then o ur \\ninvestment bankers call on them. We have our capital market teams calling on them. And we help them grow \\nand succeed. And that is going to be a big engine in the medium -term of new client acquisition feeding us.  \\n \\nSo, deeper client relationships, more growth in terms of new clients that fit with our proposition fairly \\nuniquely, and some great mega trends that we are going to be riding and pretty uniquely positioned on. And \\nwe'll keep investing to make sure that wher e areas we're behind we get into the forefront of and the areas we \\nare crushing it in, like our win rate is 82% in TTS , and we're going to make sure that we continue to do so and \\ninnovate that way. So, sorry to be so excited about this, the 4% to 5% just f eels very, very doable to Mark and \\nI. \\n \\nOPERATOR : And our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global . \\n \\nJIM MITCHELL:  Hey good morning. Mark, maybe on the revenue discussion there, let's talk about NII a little \\nbit. You guys have a very unique  deposit base, a lot smaller footprint in low -cost  consumer. Betas have been , \\nalready been high, so it doesn't seem like there's as much beta catch -up risk for you. It's 50% non -US \\nroughly. How do you think about the trajectory of NII , do you think it stab ilizes next year before rate cuts? \\nHow do we think about the puts and takes on your NII into next year?  \\n \\nMARK MASON : Yeah , thanks for the question. Look. I'm not going to give guidance for 2024 , we'll do that \\nobviously at the fourth quarter 2023 earnings. But I think it's reasonable to expect that some of the trends \\nthat we've seen so far will continue. So, if you think about what's underneath this, we'll continue to benefit \\nfrom higher rates across currencies. I think we'll continue to see benefi ts from card interest -earning balance \\ngrowth.  \\n \\nRecall that when you look at our US dollar IRE position, it's relatively neutral at this point. And interest -\\nearning balance growth is expected to be driven by continued card spend and lower payment rates. And  so, \\nI think what's important to remember, as it relates to our business, is that it's global. That we've got , while \\nyou're right in that, on the U .S. dollar side, we've seen betas kind of reach , particularly for our corporate \\nclients, reach terminal level s at the end of last year. On the non -US dollar side, betas run lower. They lag. And \\nthere's still upside there because it's a different rate curve and a different pace of increases. And so, those \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Third  Quarter  202 3 Earnings  Call  \\nOctober 13 , 2023   \\n \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 3 Citigroup Inc.   12 \\n will be some of the puts and takes to think about. Volumes,  the rates, the speed of the curve moves, and then \\nhow betas evolve, that will kind of factor in.  \\n \\nAnd then the final thing to remember is that, in our NII, we show it both with and without Markets, on the \\nex- Markets, we'll have the impact of the drag fro m the exits of the countries that kind of play out. So, we just \\nexited  Taiwan. That's going to impact obviously the next quarter's NII. So, just a couple of factors to think \\nabout  and obviously I'll give you more detail on 2024 at the fourth quarter earnin gs call.  \\n \\nOPERATOR : And our next question comes from Ryan Kenny with Morgan Stanley.  \\n \\nRYAN KENNY : Hey good morning. On the capital markets side, I heard the comments around it being hard \\nto predict when deal activity will sustainably rebound. Can you just give us an update or more color on how \\nCEOs are thinking about bringing deals live across M&A, ECM and DCM? And does the market and rate \\nvolatility over the last few weeks have any significant impact on bringing deals to completion or on the \\npipeline?  \\n \\nJAN E FRASER : Well, I think a couple pieces. I actually start with Q3 is the seventh quarter of the current IB \\ndownturn. So, since 2000, downturns have tended not to last longer than seven quarters because that's \\noften how long it takes for pricing expectation s to fully adjust to new realities. And we're starting to see that \\nparticularly in the debt capital markets, investment grade market s, where the expectation of no longer how \\nhigh , but how long for rates, we've seen clients who get off the sidelines and just bite the bullet and get into \\nthe debt capital markets in a more meaningful way and no longer waiting on that.  \\n \\nWe still think that how our recovery and return to normal wallet p lays out, when you talk to CEOs, is largely \\ndependent on the macro environment. That's the main piece for them. ECM, we're seeing increased interest \\nand activity on ECM. You obviously had several IPOs coming to market in September, three big ones that we  \\nwere involved in. But the market  is still somewhat fragile. We're watching it closely. And quite a few questions \\nin Q4 , things may move to Q1. We just have to see how that unfolds. But there's a good pipeline. I mean, \\nthere's a lot of pent -up demand here.  \\n \\nIn debt, we had a big pick -up in DCM. We feel confident that the gradual recovery in DCM and the beginnings \\nof that lev fin one will continue. You're certainly going the see us more active in the lev fin space in the right \\nsituations for our key clients.  \\n \\nAnd then in M&A, a healthy M&A sell -side pipeline. A lot of companies with their industries transforming are \\nreally wanting to think big. I think we'll see that unlocking when sentiment improves further, companies do \\naccept the new pricing reality, which w ill be helped by a rebound in equity markets. That obviously, from our \\nend, takes quite a few quarters to materialize into revenue just given the nature of the product.  \\n \\nSo, it's there, but I think just given where everything is geopolitically and particularly from the macro, no one \\nis going to make that call as to when we're going to see that sustainable turn  in banking at this point.  \\n \\nOPERATOR : And our next question come s from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research . \\n \\nSTEVEN CHUBAK : Hi good morning. So, Mark and Jane, I do recognize you'll provide a more fulsome update \\non expense actions next quarter, but one of the things I was hoping was that you could frame the expense \\nopportunity in the context of your headcount  trends. And prior to COVID, as well  as the consent order, mind \\nyou, Citi was running with 200,000 direct staff. That number is closer to 240,000 today. It's an increase of \\n20% , even with multiple divestitures that you've consummated. So how should we think about an \\nappropriate target or an optimal level of headcount  for Citi versus that pre -COVID baseline of 200,000, and \\nwhether the consent order would impact the timing or magnitude of such headcount  actions?  \\n \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Third  Quarter  202 3 Earnings  Call  \\nOctober 13 , 2023   \\n \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 3 Citigroup Inc.   13 \\n MARK MASON : So, look, I'm not going to give you headcount  guidance, but what I wil l say is Jane has talked \\nbefore about the heads associated with the divestitures that are underway. And obviously as we continue to \\nprogress in those divestitures, we've made a lot of progress already, we'll see those heads come down. It's \\nalso important t o point out that as part of our effort, there's been in -sourcing. And so, we've captured the \\nextended workforce in the headcount  that we have here.  \\n \\nAnd then I think the final point is that as we continue to execute against the Transformation work, and as we \\nimplement the org simplification that we've just announced, undoubtedly the technology investment, the \\nautomation that we're putting in place, the straight -through processing that occurs, the fewer \\nreconciliations that are required, the streamlining fro m all of those layers that Jane mentioned we'll be \\neliminating, all of those things will also work to reduce headcount  as well.  \\n \\nAnd so , while we're investing and hiring on the front -end to capture the upside as markets turn, but also as \\nwe position oursel ves to grow with clients, we're also going to realize efficiencies that come out of headcount  \\nreduction.  \\n \\nOne additional point is that you've heard me mention before that we've taken probably about $600 million \\nor so year -to-date in repositioning charges. And with that will come roughly 7,000 or so headcount  coming \\ndown associated with those repositioning charges. And so , and we'll continue to do that, by the way , we \\nhaven't even begun to take repositioning charges associated with the org simplification tha t's underway. \\nThat will come in the fourth quarter and then the first quarter of next year. And so , we will see heads continue \\nto evolve through this process, but keep in mind that there are puts and takes associated with that as we \\nlook at where we need t o in -source versus use external parties.  \\n \\nOPERATOR : And our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.  \\n \\nEBRAHIM POONAWALA : Good morning.  Just maybe, Mark, following up on that, as we think about bending \\nthe curve through the end of next year, maybe if you can talk to around as we think about the puts and takes \\nbetween investments and expense saves, how much of that cost save or bending the curve is going to \\nhappen in Legacy versus PBWM and ICG? Like, just how do you break , how should we think about that as we \\nthink about bending the curve and where the savings are coming from?  \\n \\nMARK MASON : Well, look, next year, we talked about expenses comi ng down from third quarter to fourth \\nquarter. And as we think about that, you'll have some of the benefits of the cost s going away from the exits \\nthat we would have announced. You have some of the benefit from further reduction in stranded cost, which \\nwe'v e been keenly focused on as we've exited each of these.  \\n \\nAnd then I think as we get to the medium term, you will start to see some of the benefits from the \\nTransformation spend and investments that we would have made start to play out, as well as efficienc ies \\nthat we start to get in a lower structural cost base. But again, that's in that medium -term period. So, all of \\nthose things will be drivers to getting t he bending of the curve. I haven't broken down , I'm not going to break \\ndown here on this call how mu ch comes from each of the pieces, but all are important factors to achieving \\nthat. \\n \\nOPERATOR : And our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank . \\n \\n: Hi. There were some quotes, I think, in the media, Jane, from you talking about some signs \\nof pressure among the lower end of the consumer, and I appreciate the pie chart that you have in the deck \\nshowing it's not a huge percent of the card portfolio. But could you elaborate on that? And then also just \\naddress the , you m entioned directionally how the payment rates in cards are coming down, but if we look at \\nthe growth in spend versus the growth in loans, it is kind of a little disproportionate. I think spend is up a \\ncouple percent year -over -year, and the loans are 11%. So , as we think about being kind of later -cycle, is that \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Third  Quarter  202 3 Earnings  Call  \\nOctober 13 , 2023   \\n \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 3 Citigroup Inc.   14 \\n something that you're paying attention to as a potential sign of further weakness in credit?  \\n \\nJANE FRASER : Yeah. Look, I think most of the pressure in the lower FICO, we don't have a lot of customers \\nin lower FICO , so, we're seeing it out in the market. We've got , we obviously have some in the Retail Services \\nbusiness , we also, I would say, have the benefit of that loss sharing agreement that really makes a difference \\nthere because we're having to reser ve fully for that, but we get it back on the revenue line, as you know.  \\n \\nBut as we look at the off-us book, as we look at some of the pressures in the market, as we look at spending, \\nwe can certainly see some of that pressure for the lower FICO, whereas wh en I think about the cards \\nbusiness, it's very much driven by the affluent customer. So, the affluent is accounting for almost all the \\nspending growth that we're seeing. And that's similar for the numbers that we saw coming out of the Fe d \\nfrom the deposit side, the excess savings are sitting there now primarily with households with over $150,000 \\nof income, and it's down in the rest.  \\n \\nSo, these are things we're keeping an eye on. I want to be very clear, I'm not that worried about it for Citi given \\nthe prime  nature of our card portfolio, and then the rest of our PBWM exposure is obviously very affluent.  \\n \\nBut when I look out at the market, I talk to our corporate clients, that's where we tend to see them being more \\nnervous about the softness in the consumer. A nd just , I call it they're much more mindful about where they're \\nspending, right? So , you're seeing them moving down within a category. They're certainly looking more on \\nthe bargain front. We've been hearing that from our retail partners. We've been hearin g that across the board. \\nSo, growth of card loans is good. Our spend is up , but less than loans. I think it's softening , but it's not \\nworrying.  \\n \\nMARK MASON : Yeah. I think that's spot on, Jane. The only thing I'd add is that when you look at the payment \\nrates in Branded Cards, while they've started to come down, they're still above the pre -COVID level. And we \\nobviously have invested in this business. So, the other thing that's driving this is the new account \\nacquisitions are obviously important dr ivers of that spend volume and ultimately that loan growth. But \\nagain, there's nothing that we see outside of what we were expecting in terms of how this portfolio is \\nnormalizing.  \\n \\nOPERATOR : Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.  \\n \\nGERARD CA SSIDY : Good morning,  Jane and good morning Mark. Jane, as you pointed out, you're very \\nexcited about the opportunities in TTS. You're winning some new  mandates in the custody business. Can \\nyou feel is it because the competition is struggling with other iss ues? What gives you , because Citi has always \\nbeen well -regarded in this area , so what gives you that added excitement that this is even getting better?  \\n \\nJANE FRASER : Look, I think the added excitement is , a lot of it's coming from the investments that we'v e \\nbeen making. So that we are , if you look at it in terms of Payment Express, which is live in the U .S., Thailand , \\n on track for three more markets, that is really a very differentiating capability. The momentum we have in \\n24/7 clearing that's been  put in place, we've had over $1 billion processed year -to-date. Putting our \\nCommercial Bank clients onto CitiDirect so the y have seamless access to our whole TTS network globally. \\nYou heard us talking about Citi Token Services, you can see us innovating with the Fed in new capabilities.  \\n \\nSo really across the board, it's that innovation in cutting -edge, first -in-the -market typ e of capabilities. But \\nyou're putting that on top of a network that's just unprecedented in terms of its presence, its local \\ncapabilities, its payroll, cash management, liquidity management, its collections, its receivables, all sitting \\non one platform con nected globally. And what that gives a client in terms of efficiency saves, insights on \\ndata, what they can do in terms of risk management and how to really optimize their treasury capabilities . I \\nmean, this thing is a thing of beauty.  And it's very, very hard , it's very sticky , to extricate from this because it's \\nembedded into how our clients do business , it's that critical  and into their technology systems. So, when you \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Third  Quarter  202 3 Earnings  Call  \\nOctober 13 , 2023   \\n \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 3 Citigroup Inc.   15 \\n look at where the world's headed and what's going on in the world, volatility, these o ther elements, it's hard \\nnot to see opportunities.  \\n \\nAnd it's opportunities as well with our Markets business linked in.  One of our really differentiating factors \\nthat Andy Morton talks about all the time is his partnership with TTS. The fact that one of o ur major client \\nbases are corporates and they have a different profile, let's say, to an asset manager or a hedge fund. And we \\nuniquely can serve them. So, that's the piece. It's that combination in trends we see.  \\n \\nMARK MASON : I think that's spot on, Jane.  The only thing I'd add is that the middle market commercial space \\nis a huge opportunity for us, as you said earlier, leveraging that TTS platform. And then on the Securities \\nServices side, the reality is that we're finally seeing real traction in North Am erica, right? We've always had \\nkind of strength in many of the other regions, but we're really winning some major mandates here in North \\nAmerica, which I think is enough to get really excited about.  \\n \\nJANE FRASER : And I think that, to me, is what then drive s a lot of the strategy and what we're trying to do in \\nterms of get to that high quality of earnings, better earnings mix, and other pieces that will help us get to that \\nmedium -term return target that we are so focused on.  \\n \\nOPERATOR : Our next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan .  \\n \\nVIVEK JUNEJA : Hi Jane. Hi Mark. Want to just clarify the reorganization a little bit. So, Jane, I heard you say \\nthat you're keeping North Asia and South Asia heads. So, did you just get rid of t he Asia head and get rid of \\nthe product heads, where product heads in each country were reporting to a regional product head? So, is \\nthat that dotted line is no longer there  or what's going on there? And when you get rid of all the monthly \\nmanagement repor ting, what are you planning to replace that with from your management, your MIS \\nperspective?  \\n \\nJANE FRASER : So, let me take the second one first. I'm not planning on replacing it with anything. We don't \\nneed them. We're no longer running consumer franchises  in the countries. Instead, we've got global \\nbusinesses that are operating very consistently in the individual geographies, so we just don't need to replace \\nthem. And it enables us just to have the legal entity, financial management that we need.  And then our \\ninternal reports get greatly simplified. Same as they get greatly simplified by taking out ICG and PBWM is \\nanother , eliminating that layer also eliminates a lot of different reports. So, the wonderful answer is, nothing, \\na simpler Citi.  \\n \\nThe first ques tion was about, okay, help you understand what we've done. So, on the geography front, we \\nhave done two main things already. One is we've eliminated the regions and have just put a single \\ninternational head reporting to me. So, that makes it much simpler f or me. I have one international head, and \\nthen he will help us manage the geographies collectively.  \\n \\nThe second piece is we really narrowed the mandate of geography to delivering to our clients and covering \\nour clients in their countries. And secondly, the  legal entity management. And otherwise, before, we had a \\nhuge amount of management on shadow P&Ls and different , a lot of very heavy committee structure. That \\nwas necessary because the business was still very local, as a retail bank, a local credit card b usiness, a local \\nonshore wealth business. They've gone. It's just serving multinationals. The subsidiaries are multinationals \\nand in some markets the investors and the wealth clients in some markets. And that's a much simpler \\nbusiness to manage. So, we cou ld get rid of the regional layer, and we just jump straight down to the clusters \\nthat we have today. They too have less of a mandate than they had before, a much more focused one.  \\n \\nAnd the bit that I'm excited about is not just, yes, this makes it much sim pler to manage, but it also helps us \\nreally focus on the global network. Now, our geographies and our banking organizations sitting together on \\nthe same management structure are collectively accountable for serving and delivering against our core \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Third  Quarter  202 3 Earnings  Call  \\nOctober 13 , 2023   \\n \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 3 Citigroup Inc.   16 \\n client ba se. And they're in one team to do it. It just makes it much easier. Does that give you a feel? What else, \\nMark?  \\n \\nMARK MASON : The other thing, Vivek, that I think is important here is we really want to spend a little bit \\nmore investment in time on the client lens in terms of the financial reporting, right? Because, as Jane talked \\nabout, we talked about the synergies across the franchise that we can capture, the ability to leverage the \\noffering we have for those different client segments. So, looking at that P&L, looking at those returns, looking \\nat that growth opportunity through that client lens will be something where we want to enhance the metrics \\nthat we have already around that so that we can capture that upside.  \\n \\nJANE FRASER : And around the other p iece that I think is also just an important point, globalization is \\nchanging  and we're seeing these lanes all changing through trade, financial flows, et cetera. By actually \\nhaving a single international organization and then the different clusters, North and South Asia, Europe, UK, \\nLATAM, Middle East, Africa, the connection points between them are really changing at the moment. And so, \\nthis makes us much more agile in our delivery of the global network because I think it's much more in line \\nwith how the wo rld is operating today.  \\n \\nOPERATOR : And our next question comes from Saul Martinez with HSBC . \\n \\nSAUL MARTINEZ : Hi there. So, I wanted to continue on the thread of normalization of credit losses. And you \\nguys have , I guess your guidance is implying that Brand ed Cards and Retail Services get back to more \\nnormalized levels by year -end, which is a decent -sized uptick over the levels you had in the third quarter. So, \\nI kind of want to know what's driving that view. But more importantly I guess, what does that impl y going \\nforward? And does it imply that we get to more , something more like above trend losses? Because I would \\nthink we still have some seasoning to go on the late 2021 and 2022 vintages.  \\n \\nAnd not only that, \\n  talking about this in an environment where we still have pretty extraordinary \\nlabor markets. So, if you could just give us a little bit more color on just your expectations on credit losses \\nand whether there's maybe a little bit more risk than we're think ing in terms of losses trending to something \\nthat is a bit higher than what we normally , or what are more normalized levels?  \\n \\nMARK MASON : Yes. So, let me start on that, and then, Jane, if you want to chime in, that's fine. I think what \\nI'd point you to is page 24 in the deck that we have because it gives you a nice snapshot of how both the loss \\nrates have been  trending but also how the delinquencies have been trending. And you can see that the \\ndelinquencies have been trending up, and that kind of gives u s a good indication of where loss rates are likely \\nto trend in the next quarter or so.  \\n \\nAnd so, at 2.72% on Branded Cards and 4.53% on Retail Services, we can see that we're likely to end up at \\nabout that normalized rate by the end of the year getting up t o the 3 -3.25%, 5 -5.50% pre -COVID normalized \\nNCL rates. Our expectation is that as we go into 2024, to the point that you've made, depending on the macro \\nenvironment, we're likely to see this tick up above those pre -COVID normalized rates, as we see a slowd own \\nin the economy, again, subject to what the macro looks like, before then kind of settling down at some point, \\ndown the path. And so, yes, we do see that tick up.  \\n \\nThis is again as advertised, so to speak, as we would have expected. And we have reserves , significant \\nreserves for both of these portfolios to account for those loss expectations. So, in Branded Cards, we sit with \\nan ACL to loan reserve of 6.3%, and Retail Services, we have 11%. Jane mentioned earlier that the losses in \\nRetail Services ultima tely get shared with partners. And so, while we would expect this to normalize and \\nmature, so to speak, we feel very well -reserved for what that might look like.  \\n \\nJANE FRASER : And our portfolio is very prime. I mean, this is not the old Citi. It's very dif ferent in terms of our \\nconsumer credit exposure. And I think what you're hearing from us is , this should all be very manageable.   \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Third  Quarter  202 3 Earnings  Call  \\nOctober 13 , 2023   \\n \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 3 Citigroup Inc.   17 \\n We're not , there's no alarm bells going off at Citi around this. We're being prudent. We're being conservative \\naround pieces and responsible on it. But there's no alarm bells ringing. And I think that there may be a bit of \\na disconnect from some of the questions out  there versus how we're feeling. We're just not seeing the data \\nthat is overly concerning. This is all very manageable, and we're being prudent about it, as you'd expect us to \\nbe. \\n \\nOPERATOR : And our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.  \\n \\nMIK E MAYO : Hi, thanks for the follow -up. From your initial answer, Jane, I hear you with the restructuring, \\ndeconstructing Citi to global lines, delayering of management, and de -cluttering reporting. And when you \\nadd it all together, we'll get some numbers in  January. But as it relates to your return targets and efficiency \\ntargets for 2025 and 2026, consensus is about one -third below what you target. And frankly, I have not \\nspoken to one investor who thinks you're going to get those targets and maybe you would  want to revise \\nthose lower in some way or maybe to be determined. Or what's your degree of conviction of getting to those \\ntargets or at least getting above your cost of capital?  \\n \\nJANE FRASER : Yeah , look, we remain confident around our ability to hit these  targets. We've got , you heard \\nme talk earlier around the revenue growth and what are some of the tailwinds that we've got behind us as \\nwell as the core strategy and the drivers that we're in control of and that we've been investing behind to \\nachieve. So, our strategy is unchanged , we're confident it will drive the revenue growth of 4% to 5%. It's not \\nthe primary purpose, but the org simplification is the third driver of the expense reductions that we've talked \\nabout.  \\n \\nAnd I would also say that when you loo k at revenue , expenses,  and the targets we've laid out at Investor Day, \\nwe've certainly had plenty of headwinds in macro, regulatory, geopolitics in the last couple of years. We have \\ndelivered on what we said we would do in the revenue, in the expense guid ance,  and  on the strategy. We've \\nmade adaptions along the way as we've needed to. But I think that's the piece that we're also really trying to \\ndrive into the firm is a culture of we will do what we say we will do, and we'll adapt accordingly to different \\nareas.  \\n  \\nMark talked about adapting to the capital requirements, depending on  what they are. We have other levers \\nthat we can pull, capital allocation, management buffer, DTA. But my message to our investors is we're just \\nbuilding a proof point. This is a relentless execution. Look at that strategy scorecard page at the beginning \\nof the deck there. We've achieved a lot  and there is a lot going on, and we're getting a lot done. We don't \\npretend we're at the end of the road there, we're there yet. But we're getting done what we said we'd do and \\nbuilding up those proof points so that y ou can see us achieve those return targets. Anything to add, Mark?  \\n \\nMARK MASON : As you said, building credibility and being transparent , right? So, we're going to keep \\ndelivering on the proof points, and we're going to be transparent about how and when and  how we're going \\nto achieve it.  \\n \\nOPERATOR:  And our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.  \\n \\nGERARD CASSIDY : Mark, you mentioned in the credit section that the delinquencies are rising, and as a \\npercentage of loans, they're still very low. I was j ust curious on the corporate loans in North America there \\nwas an uptick. Again, I know relative to the portfolio, it's not that big. But anything in particular you can share \\nwith us in that area?  \\n \\nMARK MASON : On the corporate loans, we saw los s, I think lo sses were $51 million in the quarter, so a small \\namount. We did see an uptick, as you point out, in the reserves. That was really driven by some country rating \\nadjustments that were made. And then we did see an increase in the NALs, the non -accrual loans. And that \\nwas really one or two names and one in North America, one in EMEA. Both of them are current. But they drove \\nT R A N S C R I P T \\nCiti  Third  Quarter  202 3 Earnings  Call  \\nOctober 13 , 2023   \\n \\n   \\n \\nCopyright © 202 3 Citigroup Inc.   18 \\n the uptick that we saw in the quarter there.  \\n \\nOPERATOR:  And there are no further questions in the queue. I will turn the call over to Jenn Landis for closing \\nremarks.  \\n \\nJENNIFER LANDIS : Thank you, all, for joining us.
